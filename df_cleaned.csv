Yet hope still flickers throughout this documentary, which tells the stories of six Jewish women who survived the Nazi death machine and went on to rebuild their lives in the United States.Starting with the Allied liberation of the concentration camps, the film traces the women’s experiences using interviews and news footage, some of it horribly brutal. Life was treacherous for Jews in Europe even after the war. Anti-Semitism remained virulent, and survivors journeyed long distances home only to find their possessions stolen. One woman recalls coming back and being threatened by strangers who had moved into her house and were wearing her clothes.All six eventually relocated to America, where they were bewildered by friends and relatives, who were loath to mention the camps. We hear how these women struggled with questions of whether to have children, who to trust and how to live with recurring nightmares. Most have since found a measure of peace; several continue to speak publicly about their experiences.Jon Kean, the director, chose the material wisely and doesn’t shy from severe images. He and his team also have good ears for anecdotes. One woman remembers making clothes from old parachutes. Another tells of pulling her son out of the Boy Scouts; the organization’s uniforms and practices reminded her too much of the Germans.Though this valuable film highlights the women’s later successes, not all of the survivors are optimistic. After learning of recent atrocities in other countries, a few lament our still-violent world. “Didn’t people learn anything from World War II, and from the Holocaust?” one asks. Her question is enough to elicit shame, for too often it seems we haven’t.",0,,,0

Jennifer Aniston plays Claire, who, having survived a horrific accident, now lives in near isolation in Los Angeles in a midcentury magazine layout of a house. Its clean lines, drawn by an architect and embellished by a period-design obsessive, make a vivid contrast with the scars jaggedly slashed across Claire’s face and body. Her wounds have healed, but her grimace and the shadows darkening it announce that she’s far from whole. The spectacle of female suffering has produced a lot of great movies; “Cake” is not one of them. It’s the sort of well-intentioned independent effort that can make criticism feel like overkill. There’s nothing to hate, nothing to love. The movie’s greatest virtue is that it gives Ms. Aniston a little room to play against the somewhat sardonic tough-cookie type that she deploys in vulgar comedies, like “We’re the Millers,” in which she both gets the job done and rises enough above the material to stroll away unscathed. Bad dialogue and roles often seem to just slide off her, sluicing down a slight hardness that (as with the midcareer Ginger Rogers) adds a little brass to the bright, blond picture.Written by Patrick Tobin and directed by Daniel Barnz, “Cake” opens with Claire upending her chronic-pain support group. The featured attraction in this circle of despair is a large, mounted photograph of a former group member, Nina (Anna Kendrick), who’s recently taken a fatal dive off a freeway ramp. As the attendees sniffle and dab their red eyes, the group facilitator, Annette (Felicity Huffman), encourages the women to process their grief. “Will you forgive me?” Annette asks, pretending to speak for Nina. Claire, understandably, has no interest in playing this game and says something blunt that shocks the room and, also understandably, leads to her being booted out. The scene is played for laughs, most sourly aimed at Annette and the other touchy-feely therapy saps.All’s fair in love and especially in comedy. There’s something strange, though, about a movie that solicits laughter at the expense of its most disposable characters (here mostly played by extras), even as it insists on indulgence for its protagonist (played by the star). In “Cake,” that’s particularly the case, because it follows a woman weighed down by tragedy on a therapeutic journey from one stage of grief to the next. Claire is facedown in depression at the start of the story, and it gives nothing away to say that she’s chin up in acceptance by the end. The movie hits so many familiar beats that it’s impossible not to see what’s next. It does what you expect at almost every turn, even with some hallucinations that, with one piercing exception, seem calculated to keep real hurt at bay. Claire’s story emerges through a miasma of moans and true and false notes. Just getting out of bed is an agony for her, as Ms. Aniston suggests with a stiff, constricted physical performance to go with the character’s clenched face and shuttered, shattered world. The introduction of Nina’s husband, Roy (Sam Worthington), gives Ms. Aniston an excuse to warm Claire up. But he’s a distraction and an unfortunate one, because Claire’s most dynamic relationship is with her Latina housekeeper, Silvana (Adriana Barraza, very good), an exploited saint. Their relationship borders on the embarrassingly unexamined, and Silvana is woefully underwritten, but every so often — as when the story follows her home — life flickers into view, as does another movie about two mutually dependent equals.“Cake” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

And in “The Rewrite,” as he plays a spoiled screenwriter and one-hit Hollywood wonder on the skids, you can feel the strain as he goes through the routine one more time. His character, Keith Michaels, won an Oscar for best original screenplay in 1999 for something called “Paradise Misplaced,” but hasn’t had a hit since, and his A-list status has plummeted. The squirm-inducing opening scene shows Keith desperately pitching a concept in which Jack Nicholson fakes his death and stages his own funeral to see what people really think of him. This idea is nixed by producers in pursuit of the latest trend: “edgy comedies with a kick-ass type woman.” Desperate for work, Keith agrees to teach screenwriting at Binghamton University, near the New York-Pennsylvania border. Breezing into Binghamton, N.Y., a town he loathes on sight, Keith blithely proclaims to anyone within earshot: “I don’t believe that writing can be taught. You can’t teach talent.” Without a second thought, he beds Karen (Bella Heathcote), who ends up in his class.Instead of choosing his students based on their writing samples, Keith researches their Facebook profiles and stacks his course with the prettiest women who applied. On his first day on the job, he dismisses the class for a month, but not before falsely claiming that Matt Damon is interested in starring in his latest project. Keith also meets his nemesis, Mary Weldon (Allison Janney), a severe, scowling Jane Austen scholar, tenured professor and head of the college ethics committee, and an imperious type Ms. Janney has down cold. When they’re introduced, Keith, straining to be witty, remarks, “I’m just a little bit tired of female empowerment.” From that moment, she regards him with suspicion and contempt. The smart, needling dialogue in these opening scenes has a satirical bite almost equal to that of the Showtime series “Episodes.” It sets a high standard that the rest of the movie can’t maintain, as the story settles into a formulaic tale about a scoundrel’s redemption. At the outset, Keith, divorced and alienated from his college-age son, is a really bad guy. That Mr. Grant can bring Keith back from the edge more or less persuasively is a testament to his ability to convey genuine humility without mawkishness, once he sees the light. Binghamton, nicknamed the Carousel Capital of the World, is also the childhood home of Rod Serling, whose “Walking Distance” episode of “The Twilight Zone” embodies the movie’s message in a father’s advice to his son: “You’ve been looking behind you. ... Try looking ahead.”“The Rewrite” has a relaxed, easygoing performance by J. K. Simmons as Keith’s department head, Harold Lerner, who is married with four daughters. Marisa Tomei as Holly Carpenter, one of Keith’s students — a single mother who has two jobs and becomes a possible love interest — is solidly likable. To its credit, “The Rewrite” resists the temptation to fling them into each other’s arms at the first opportunity. By the time they acknowledge their mutual attraction, they have a shared history on which to build.",0,324889.0,,0

That much becomes clear in the director Daniel Alfredson’s dreary, uninvolving fictionalized take on the real 1983 snatching of Alfred Heineken, chairman of the company bearing his family’s name. A few years ago, the same story was turned into “The Heineken Kidnapping,” a Dutch movie with Rutger Hauer in the title role, which racked up some business in the Netherlands and is available on Amazon on demand. It is a puzzlement why anyone thought that the world needed another movie about this kidnapping, which plays out as a shopworn tale of greed, stupidity and deserved comeuppance. This time, Anthony Hopkins plays the big brew king, who, amid murky shadows and awkward camera angles, is grabbed off an Amsterdam street with his chauffeur, Ab Doderer (David Dencik), by a gang of idiots. These four are played by an international crew of familiar names — Jim Sturgess, Sam Worthington, Ryan Kwanten and an actual Dutch dude, Mark van Eeuwen — who, with Mr. Hopkins, probably got this flick bankrolled. Like Mr. Hopkins, the actors playing the kidnappers speak in shades of accented English, though Mr. Worthington, as a hothead named Willem Holleeder, doesn’t seem to be trying to master a Dutch inflection terribly hard or perhaps just gave up. He’s playing more a notion (he’s the criminal with daddy issues) than a realized character, an under-conceptualization that you might think would have been evident in the script. The screenplay credited to William Brookfield covers the basic facts of the kidnapping and briefly and irritatingly suggests that the abductors were at least partly motivated by economic hard times. This dubious socio-economic rationalization evaporates the moment the four, guns firing wildly, rob a bank to finance the kidnapping. Their capture proves anticlimactic, as does the follow-up, which largely involves the sad-sack villains flailing about and looking quizzically at one another. Mr. Hopkins doesn’t have much to do, but it can be amusing to see him upstage everyone else with sonorous murmurings and imperious demands for a robe and Chinese takeout. When the kidnappers leave the ransom letter in a copy machine, the movie seems to be lurching into gang-who-can’t-shoot-straight burlesque. The filmmakers, alas, seem to think that they have something serious to say and that Mr. Sturgess’s doe eyes will reveal the heart beneath this mess. The basis for his character, Cor van Hout, apparently went on to become, with the real Mr. Holleeder, a criminal mastermind, which given this movie seems like pure science fiction.“Kidnapping Mr. Heineken” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Miscast and misdirected from first ridiculous scene to last, they play George and Serena Pemberton, 1929 glamour-pusses who, soon after the story opens, marry and move to his timber camp. There, he plans to build an empire or dominate nature or something — it’s telling that it is never wholly clear what he has in mind beyond felling trees — while Serena, well, she intends to dominate poor George. Serena does just that largely through a lot of awkward love scenes that turn the characters into tangles of disembodied body parts and find Ms. Lawrence’s head pinwheeling in painful, at times comically so, pantomimes of ecstasy. It’s embarrassing watching a likable, supremely capable actor like Ms. Lawrence deliver a performance more suited to a Mel Brooks burlesque, though her vamping and eye-popping are really no worse than Mr. Cooper’s maladroit Boston accent and palpable, at times visible, discomfort. The actors don’t just look uncomfortable in their period duds, they also look uneasy in their own skins, which is a feat for two such natural, physically confident screen performers.The Danish director Susanne Bier, whose credits include “Open Hearts” and “Things We Lost in the Fire,” has done good work with actors before, so it’s hard to know what happened here or why. Whatever the case, she seems as unsteady as her two stars although, given how overedited the movie is, it can be difficult to tell if the scenes ever had any integrity before they were put in a Cuisinart. (Ms. Bier apparently spent more than a year in postproduction trying to get the movie in shape.) That said, all the deep-fried performances, including from Rhys Ifans as a weird mountain man with a gun, strongly suggest that no amount of post magic could have saved this picture from its makers.Based on a well-regarded 2008 novel by the American author Ron Rash, the story takes place in the North Carolina mountains and finds George and Serena first battling those who want to turn the area into a park and then fighting each other. Blood spills and drama erupts, but none of it registers. What does register is that this is another recent bid from a Danish director to recreate not simply the American past but also a Hollywood-style version of that past. In “The Salvation,” the Danish director Kristian Levring reimagines the old American West in a movie shot in South Africa; here, Ms. Bier has tried to recreate 1920s Appalachia in the Czech Republic. The German filmmaker Wim Wenders once observed that the Americans have “colonized our subconscious,” so I guess we have only ourselves to blame.“Serena” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘The Forger’ Stars John Travolta as a Convict and Painter,"A late entry in the weary Boston crime subgenre, “The Forger” finds a morose John Travolta as a silver-maned convict named Ray Cutter. Less than a year away from the end of his sentence, Ray expedites his release by racking up a debt to a powerful bad guy. The reason for Ray’s haste is that his teenage son, Will (Tye Sheridan), has a brain tumor and may not have long to live. But the payback is a dangerous job painting a fake Monet for the Museum of Fine Arts.Preposterousness is not necessarily a vice, and plausibility is a weak virtue. Just ask Alfred Hitchcock. So to say that the conceits of “The Forger” (directed by Philip Martin) are ridiculous isn’t really saying much. It’s also dull, incoherent and drab to look at. There may be a glimmer of interest when Christopher Plummer shows up as Ray’s con-man dad, and another when Will’s drug-addict mother turns out to be Jennifer Ehle, but hope is quickly replaced by frustration that they had to waste their talents on a piece of straight-to-video hack work.Mr. Travolta teeters between tough-guy menace and soulful, artistic intensity, but you don’t ever believe that he can paint or that he can beat up a whole squad of younger, bigger, meaner dudes. He does both, of course, and whatever else the script (by Richard D’Ovidio) calls for. Toward the end, when “The Forger” turns into a jaunty, silly caper, it shows a bit of energy, but otherwise it’s by the numbers and an obvious fake.“The Forger” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

As the ringleader of a crew of dirty cops stationed at the 75th Precinct in East New York, he padded his income by stealing money, guns and drugs from dealers. He eventually graduated to working for drug rings, one of which put him on retainer so he could provide information about narcotic operations. “The Seven Five” has been called “the cop version of ‘GoodFellas,’ ” which may explain why Sony has plans to produce a fictional remake. Here’s hoping that version uses a better moral compass. You learn a lot in “The Seven Five” about Mr. Dowd’s criminal exploits, which emerge in original interviews with him and some of his former associates, in re-creations of their exploits and, valuably, in clips from his testimony before the Mollen Commission. It was formed after Mr. Dowd and a handful of other dirty cops were arrested on narcotic charges, and its mission was spelled out in its title: “Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and the Anti-Corruption Procedures of the Police Department.” Among its many bleak findings was that Mr. Dowd’s underworld activities were so lucrative that from 1987 to 1988 he reaped $4,000 a week from drug organizations in his precinct. Sometimes he even forgot to pick up his paycheck.And now Mr. Dowd, having served time in a federal prison, is making a comeback as the star of this breathless, ethically challenged documentary, which the director Tiller Russell has pulled together as slickly as an episode of “Law & Order” (without, you know, much of either). The main source here is Mr. Dowd, who, mouth gunning, excitedly recounts how he stole drugs and money, stories that are interlaced with talking-head accounts from some of his past associates, including former cops and drug dealers who are thanked in the credits. Every so often if not nearly enough, you also hear from some of the good guys who helped bring Mr. Dowd down, including one who soberly invokes what bad guys like Mr. Dowd meant for neighborhoods under his watch.When asked by the Mollen Commission whether his loyalties were with “the community he was supposed to be policing” or the drug traffickers he protected, Mr. Dowd said, “I guess I’d have to say the drug traffickers.” Again and again, you see him before the commission, but his testimony tends to get lost amid the hyperventilated crime stories. That’s too bad. He was a font of information, as when he testified hat the police officers who “are taking money will more typically be the ones that are giving beatings.” As the commission found, “Dowd, like other officers, reported that brutality strengthened the bonds of loyalty and silence among officers and thus fostered corruption tolerance.” This documentary could have a whole lot more Mollen and a whole lot less of Mr. Dowd. A movie like “The Seven Five” has only minor use as a historical document; its principal function is to package gonzo tales of bad behavior into commercial entertainment that plays down the real suffering behind those stories. Mr. Dowd’s vehement narration does have, at times, a vague Joe-Pesci-in-“GoodFellas” feel, which is amusing only if you ignore the historical record. In 1988, when Mr. Dowd was still on the force, an estimated 100 people were murdered in East New York. Those dead should haunt “The Seven Five,” which instead breezes through its crimes while tossing out grim images of unidentified black and brown bodies. I wonder if these will show up in the fictional version that as Variety reported, Sony won the rights to after a winning bid of “around the seven-figure range.” “The Seven Five” is rated R (No one under 17 admitted without parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘Aloha,’ a Hangout Movie With Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone in Hawaii","Let me say right up front that I will always root for Cameron Crowe. That’s the kind of blunt, sincere, slightly inappropriate statement one of his characters might blurt out at an odd moment, and so much the better. He had me at the “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” script, and I’m probably not the only self-conscious, music-crazed guy of my generation who found possible alternate selves in Mr. Crowe’s alter egos: Lloyd Dobler in “Say Anything,” William Miller in “Almost Famous” and even Jerry Maguire himself. All of this is to say that while I can’t make any excuses for “Aloha”— to the extent it can even figure out what movie it wants to be, it’s not a very good one — I can leaven my disappointment with mercy. Mr. Crowe is a huge fan of forgiveness, and so (occasional appearances to the contrary) am I. I can even say that I had a good time, a better time than I had at “Vanilla Sky” or “Elizabethtown.” But now I’m starting to get a little depressed. I enjoyed “Aloha” the way you can enjoy a catch-up beer with an old friend you don’t have much in common with anymore. Set among military service people and contractors in Hawaii, it’s a loose, leisurely hangout movie, funny and sprawling and full of eccentric, interesting folks. Or at least it should have been. The plot is a hash when it’s not a drag, and the 100-odd-minute cut of the film arriving in theaters on Friday seems hacked from something longer and baggier. You don’t really want the neoliberal business intrigue or the imperialist guilt trip or the by-the-book romantic comedy, and it’s not clear Mr. Crowe does either. You want Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone verbally arm wrestling their way into each other’s hearts. You want Ms. Stone and Bill Murray dancing at the officers’ club. You want Danny McBride and Rachel McAdams and Alec Baldwin doing whatever it is they’re supposed to be doing here. Or, rather, doing something else, while you sip your Diet Coke and wish that your troubles could be as silly, as charming and as weirdly, idiosyncratically glamorous as what you see on screen.You get just enough of all of the above to keep you wanting more. A few awkward social scenes through which the camera darts, turns and pivots like a nosy, overfamiliar guest. A scene of two men in a kitchen not speaking, their silences decoded by witty subtitles. Mr. Cooper ranting at Ms. Stone in a way that leaves it up to her to decide if he’s being flirtatious or mean. Ms. Stone sending crush waves back at him from her enormous blue eyes. The words “sad city coyote” applied to his character.That’s the good stuff, or some of it, anyway. There’s some less good stuff too, including a few worn-out, generationally questionable musical cues. (I think they call it “dad rock” nowadays. I remember when it was “classic rock.” Before that I guess it was just “rock,” but let’s not date ourselves.) Then there is the way Hawaii and its indigenous people are used as an evocative, superficial backdrop for the troubles of white people. This is standard Hollywood procedure, but the conceit that Ms. Stone’s character, Capt. Allison Ng, is supposed to be a quarter Hawaiian doesn’t really help.Captain Ng, a fighter pilot, is assigned to accompany Brian Gilcrest (Mr. Cooper) on what is supposedly a culturally sensitive ceremonial mission. A veteran with various scrapes and disgraces under his belt, Gilcrest works for the billionaire Carlson Welch (Mr. Murray), who is about to launch a private rocket from an island military base. Gilcrest’s job is partly to smooth things over with a Hawaiian leader (Dennis Kanahele, playing himself), but a lot of other issues get in the way. Mostly Gilcrest’s former girlfriend (Ms. McAdams), who is married (to a strong, silent fellow played by John Krasinski) with two kids, one of them a precociously cute boy (Jaeden Lieberher) who rattles on about Hawaiian mythology and outer space.There’s also a daughter (Danielle Rose Russell), but that’s enough summarizing for now. “Aloha” has too much story and yet not quite enough, and its rhythms are rushed and pokey. It skips like a record playing in the bed of a pickup truck. Themes pop into the sky and then fade like vapor trails. We’re invited to think about lofty, global matters like the fate of American identity in an age of corporate hegemony and then told to forget about it and have another beer. Potential conflicts arise only to be set aside or resolved, and Mr. Crowe seems reluctant to allow the possibility of unhappiness to linger long enough for the restoration of happiness to feel welcome and earned. Everybody is too eager to forgive, forget and move on. I guess that goes for me too.“Aloha” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Kids might have some questions.

These naïve co-conspirators — Sam (Luke Mitchell), a former high school football star with a pregnant girlfriend and a nightmarish factory job; his drug-dealing older brother, Mike (Jason Ritter), who is married with a small child; and his best friend, Owen (Zane Holtz) — fantasize that robbing Sam and Mike’s crooked uncle’s bank will be a snap. Their shabby Washington State town is a grim dead end whose residents all seem to supplement their meager incomes through crime, be it dealing drugs or white-collar chicanery. Owen’s father, Mr. B (a crinkly eyed Kris Kristofferson), is a professional criminal whose motto is simple: “Don’t get caught.” Mr. B’s partner in crime, Tuckey, who muscles his way into the scheme, is a sinister brute in a fringed western jacket and a bloodthirsty gleam in his eye. As the movie zigzags in time, the three bungle a major drug deal that leaves them owing $60,000 to their vengeful supplier. The heist, if successful, would solve their problems, and Sam and his sweetheart, Kate (Leven Rambin), a former cheerleader, could leave town and start over.“7 Minutes” knows exactly what it is: a directorial calling card to the Quentin Tarantino school of blood-bath cinema. Colorful peripheral characters include Brandi (Mariel Neto), a promiscuous barfly who seduces Mike, and Jerome (Brandon Hardesty), a blubbery policeman who pines for her. In one of the movie’s meanest touches, Jerome takes off his shirt, inspects his torso in a mirror, and screams in horrified despair. This film is a nasty piece of work.",0,,,1

Whether the title refers to their presence — or whether they are, perhaps, more alien to one another than to those around them — is a question left unresolved by this well-acted fiction feature debut from Kim Farrant.Catherine (Nicole Kidman) and Matthew (Joseph Fiennes) have moved because of a situation involving their teenage daughter, Lily (Maddison Brown). Lily’s skimpy wardrobe and defiant manner alarm her father, in a hint of a continuing dynamic.But just as Lily’s involvement with a group of young men at a skate park threatens to take the movie into “Straw Dogs” territory, she and her younger brother, Tommy (Nicholas Hamilton), wander off at night, in a coyly constructed sequence that leaves its characters’ motivations unclear. In an overwrought metaphor, the town is soon clouded by a dust storm.With the kids’ chances of survival dwindling, a detective, Rae (a bearded Hugo Weaving, bucking typecasting in an unusually warm turn), learns more about the circumstances of the family’s relocation. Adding to the complications, Rae is involved in a relationship only one degree removed from the case.The progressive wrinkles — as Matthew reveals a violent side and Catherine appears to fray mentally — are both the fascination and the frustration of “Strangerland,” which strains credulity with its secrets and revelations to facilitate its surprises.“Strangerland” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

No, not that next step — they’re about to buy a house.Craig’s fear of commitment manifests itself in an odd way. He decides to take a tour of the South (something that requires lying to his girlfriend) and visit an assortment of “largest” attractions. The world’s largest rocking chair. The world’s largest cedar bucket. The world’s largest frying pan.Along the way, he has numerous telephone conversations with his girlfriend, a device that never makes for very lively cinema. He also meets a few local residents, has a flirtation with another woman and, well, that’s about it. The humor here is thin, and Craig’s small epiphanies along the way don’t amount to much.

It looks so hard! But here he is, the 53-year-old Tom Terrific, holding onto a plane as it takes off, defying sense and gravity, and making you wonder (not for the first time) if he would actually die for our pleasure. By the time he’s flailing underwater without an oxygen tank, struggling against violent surges as breath and time run out, you can almost feel the life leaving his body. The first “Mission: Impossible” movie, a spinoff from the 1960s television show, was released 19 years ago and was, though it’s almost hard to believe it now, something of an auteurist event, having been directed by Brian De Palma. Mr. Cruise was an established action star by 1996, but he also helped produce the first film, which strengthened his status as an international brand. As a star-auteur, he has always been the most important feature and effect of the series, although it’s telling that Mr. De Palma oversaw the set-piece that gave the movies their foundational image: Mr. Cruise’s operative, Ethan Hunt, hovering like a spider (or a puppet) above a luminous white floor while suspended by a very thin rope.As the clock tick-tocks, and Ethan struggles to keep his cool — a single drop of sweat splashed on the floor would blow the operation — the visual gloss and high-tech gobbledygook, Mr. Cruise’s graceful athleticism and Mr. De Palma’s New Hollywood suspense chops flow together, turning the scene into the emblematic “Mission: Impossible” showstopper. It’s the kind of pure cine-spectacle that jolts you before sweeping you up. There’s never been a scene in the series as memorable as that one, even if the exploding fish tank, the film’s other eye-popper, comes close. These sequences set a high bar both for directors who followed in Mr. De Palma’s wake and for Mr. Cruise’s physical performance, which in the later installments has largely involved progressively scarier stunts.The writer and director of the latest movie — its goofy full title is “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” — is Christopher McQuarrie, who’s been tethered to Mr. Cruise for the past decade. They worked together on Mr. McQuarrie’s adaptation of “Jack Reacher,” a grim genre bummer that was a bad fit for Mr. Cruise, who can rarely go tough and dark with conviction. Mr. McQuarrie also had a hand in writing “Edge of Tomorrow,” Doug Liman’s underloved science-fiction romp that dovetailed with Mr. Cruise’s strengths, including a too infrequently tapped gift for light comedy. Mr. McQuarrie, who made his name with his rebuslike script for “The Usual Suspects,” tends to work the more lugubrious end of the entertainment spectrum, so it’s a nice surprise that “Rogue Nation” isn’t just another clenched-jaw blowout. Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, “Rogue Nation” is pretty much like most of the “Impossible” movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star. Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg (with his valuable comic timing) are all back, joined by the series newcomer Rebecca Ferguson. She plays a super-vixen, the amusingly named Ilsa Faust, who enters with the camera peeking up her skirt and rises like a half-shell Venus, à la the original Bond Girl, Ursula Andress. Even so, Ms. Ferguson has more going for her than man-throttling thighs (and an ace stunt double, Lucy Cork); she holds her own both on the ground and in midair.Mr. Cruise looks comfortable with Ms. Ferguson, another plus. For most of his action-movie career, he has come across as a less romantically nimble, less self-amused version of Douglas Fairbanks, the swashbuckler who leaped through the silent era. Like Mr. Cruise, Fairbanks performed many of his own white-knuckle stunts, as when he climbs up the chain of a closing drawbridge in “Robin Hood.” (Fairbanks helped start United Artists, which Mr. Cruise owned a piece of for a while.) All too often, Mr. Cruise’s insistence on doing frightening stunts in the “Mission: Impossible” series has become its most distinguishing quality. In this movie, though, when he goes airborne like a barnstormer, the scene’s self-conscious sense of the absurd suggests he’s trying to let his inner Harold Lloyd out to play. That helps speed up “Rogue Nation,” which slows down when the plot tangles or some ceremonial manly peacocking ensues, usually from Mr. Renner and Mr. Cruise. Clearly Mr. McQuarrie and his star feel the need to stamp the series with seriousness, something that Mr. De Palma knew better than to do. And throughout “Rogue Nation,” you can sense the filmmakers comfortably, at times awkwardly, playing tug of war with the mood, which grows sinister with the excellent Sean Harris as the regulation evil genius and almost frisky with Alec Baldwin as an intelligence blowhard and Tom Hollander as a political boob. Mr. Pegg’s second-banana flair is especially crucial here because it helps show that Mr. Cruise, whose smile at times seems awfully strained these days, can still take a ribbing as well as a licking.“Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Kids, don’t try this at home.",0,154979949.0,,1

He’s a talented flimflam artist and, for the industry, I imagine, a useful one because of how he glosses up schlocky, sketchy projects (his “Sherlock Holmes” movies and other hyperkinetic baubles), making them seem as if there’s more to their slick surfaces than naked commercialism, agency fees and facile pleasure. It works for him (he keeps getting hired), and sometimes also for us. Pleasure is, after all, rarely overrated, including in the often mind-bludgeoning arena of franchise cinema, and there’s a lot to be said for watching beautiful people doing very silly stuff on screen.His latest, “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” is, as its title trumpets, a big-screen rendering of that 1960s television series. Running from 1964 to ’68, the show centered on a pair of operatives, an American, Napoleon Solo (named by Ian Fleming, an early creative adviser, and played with unctuous suavity by Robert Vaughn), and his nimble Soviet counterpart, Illya Kuryakin (a professionally enigmatic David McCallum, working a blond Beatle fringe and contrasting turtlenecks). In a flourish of showbiz détente, the spies have been teamed to fight one of those fictional criminal outfits (T.H.R.U.S.H.) that make it seem as if real-world villainy can be handled with little more than charm and Zippo lighters that fire bullets. The television series is a goof, and a fig leaf for Cold War dread.The movie opens in 1963 but tries hard not to be a museum piece, partly with a slick, agitated style. It revs up in the vicinity of Checkpoint Charlie, somewhere in East Berlin, but stays there only long enough to crash some cars and pick up the actress Alicia Vikander. She plays Gaby, one of those amusingly all-purpose characters who, in addition to having some useful relatives — her father is a nuclear physicist, her uncle an unreconstructed Nazi — can fix a car engine, slip into a couture outfit and snap a flaccid line to life. Mostly, she is the regulation Girl and narrative bridge uniting the new Napoleon (Henry Cavill, a charming stiff who seems mostly interested in trying to mimic Mr. Vaughn’s staccato) with the new Illya (Armie Hammer, easier on the eyes than ears).Gaby also serves as the political football in the opener, which finds Napoleon coercing her to go over the wall in the name of the greater good or some such. First, though, they need to outmaneuver Illya, which they do in one of those Tom-and-Jerry chases that nicely shows off the stunt performers’ wheel skills in providentially emptied streets. Written by Mr. Ritchie and Lionel Wigram, the movie throws out a lot of plot, most of which disintegrates on impact but pragmatically leads to Napoleon, Illya and Gaby in cahoots. Locations change as fast as the actors’ outfits, and at one point Hugh Grant shows up at the races as does another attraction, the villainous Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki), who brings to mind by turns a lost Redgrave relative and Madonna, Mr. Ritchie’s ex.At times “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” works better as a fashion show than a movie, with a wardrobe — Mary Quant-like minis, form-fitting bespoke suits, a caftan that Jean Shrimpton could have worn (a few years later) for a Vogue shoot — that expresses more about the era than anything in the script. (The costume designer is Joanna Johnston.) Mr. Ritchie tends to flaunt his wares like a store clerk, fawning over the clothes, chairs and cars, and his usual rabbity pace slows to a tortoiselike crawl whenever the actors deliver a lot of words, which gratefully isn’t often. His talent, as he proves repeatedly, is making bodies and cars crash through space, and there’s a long, divertingly twisty and wordless chase near the end that suggests he would have just killed in Mack Sennett’s studio. “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

On the heels of a diagnosis of Stage 3 melanoma, David makes a beeline for the tanning salon, cigarette in hand. He’s not in shock, he’s in denial.But disavowal is David’s modus operandi. A former child star who obsessively watches reruns of his television-show glory days, he’s also a profoundly closeted gay man and a flamboyantly heedless drunk. By day, he makes audio recordings of self-help affirmations for women who prefer to face up to their failings. What they also favor, David’s boss says before firing him, is a guru who sounds straight. Pursuing his character’s self-destructive, often tasteless agenda, Mr. Mills (drawing on his own experiences and doing triple duty as the director and screenwriter) gives a performance of rancid single-mindedness. It’s a fearlessly unsympathetic role that provides plenty of space for train-wreck humor but almost no wiggle room for redemption. If your tolerance for self-loathing antiheroes is as high as mine, that won’t be a problem; taken to extremes, however, they can suck the air from those around them. This becomes evident when David fraudulently acquires a probationary position as a high school guidance counselor and forms a wary connection with Jabrielle (an intriguing Zahra Bentham).A guarded black student whose chronic truancy shields an abusive home life, Jabrielle inches closer as David’s unconventional counseling methods — like sharing vodka shots with his students and encouraging one to be an inspiration for “all the other sluts out there” — win him some fans. But Jabrielle, in keeping with most of the movie’s satellite characters, is written so flimsily that she operates mainly as a mirror for David’s unacknowledged issues.We’ve seen this selfishly inappropriate behavior before, most recently in higher-profile projects like the 2011 duo “Bad Teacher” and “Young Adult,” both of which relied on liberal levels of acidity to sell their jokes. “Guidance” also risks comparison with any number of films that present white teachers as saviors of nonwhite high schoolers, but Mr. Mills isn’t preaching that particular sermon. Flipping the script just enough to matter, he creates a mutually beneficial, if wildly unhinged, union built on damage and desperation.Shot in Toronto, in daylight-bright scenes that soften the darkness of the material, “Guidance” eventually finds a bilious heart beneath David’s buttoned-up corduroy jacket and keep-off demeanor. That’s the thing about good deeds: They have a way of bouncing back at you, whether you want them to or not.",1,,,1

What “the mind’s eye” envisions is tumultuous and sexy. Lithe, blond, beautiful and exuding a doe-like fragility, Ingrid, who spends her spare time writing on a computer, gropes her way around the immaculate high-rise apartment in Oslo where she lives with her husband, Morten (Henrik Rafaelsen), a successful architect. Morten repeatedly urges Ingrid to venture into the outside world, but she is fiercely reluctant. And as you watch her stumbling around and having difficulty navigating the simplest tasks, she appears far from ready. In one compelling image, Ingrid strips naked and flattens her torso against a window. Viewed from afar, she suggests a trapped bird that has smashed itself against the glass.How and exactly when Ingrid lost her sight is never explained. Her condition is largely metaphorical. There is no mention of Ingrid’s employing a seeing-eye dog or learning Braille. She uses voice-assisted devices that read emails and text messages out loud.In the handsomely photographed opening sequence, Ingrid addresses the challenge of identifying familiar objects by touch, the visual memory of which, she has been told, will fade, because the optic nerve will wither. But with persistent efforts to remember, she adds, that loss can be slowed. From its deceptively austere and poetic beginning, “Blind” could take any number of paths. The one it does choose tracks Ingrid’s feverish erotic imagination, in which Morten is carrying on a secret sex life. In the first of many fantasy sequences, she pictures him having a steamy Internet dialogue with Elin (Vera Vitali), a single mother newly relocated from Sweden to Oslo, while lying next to Ingrid in bed, his computer on his lap. Ingrid’s jealousy and suspicion inflame her with rage and desire, and she is suddenly hot for her husband, whom in other scenes she describes as “boring.”Does Elin really exist outside Ingrid’s imagination? Perhaps not. But when Elin’s son suddenly and inexplicably becomes a daughter, you realize that Elin is a character in the story Ingrid is writing on her computer while guzzling red wine. Elin develops into Ingrid’s literary alter ego, one whom the author relentlessly punishes in her story. On Elin’s first date with Morten at an upscale restaurant, she is humiliated when she suddenly loses her sight and tries in vain to cover it up. After they have sex, Morten callously dumps her. Later, Elin, permanently blind and pregnant from the one-night stand, teeters on high heels while mounting a treacherous metal staircase in search of Morten. The fourth major character, Einar (Marius Kolbenstvedt), also probably imaginary, is a stocky, socially inept former classmate of Morten’s who lives across the street from Elin and furtively observes her from his windows and sometimes pantomimes her body language. Addicted to Internet pornography (the movie shows fleeting snippets of hard-core sex), he is a compulsive masturbator as well as a voyeur.A miserable loner who identifies with the deformed teenager played by Eric Stoltz in the 1985 film “Mask,” Einar wistfully recalls the July 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway that killed nearly 100 at an island youth camp and in a car bomb explosion. After the attacks, he recalls, strangers on the street made sorrowful eye contact, and the communal acknowledgment of the calamity gave him a brief a sense of belonging. The final act of “Blind” is a surreal set piece in which the characters converge at a party that Morten has pressured Ingrid to attend. “Blind” evokes a dreamy, dour fusion of Charlie Kaufman and Ingmar Bergman. Its few flashes of wry humor are outweighed by mystically beautiful images, of which the most striking is a recurrent close-up of reflections in an eyeball. “Blind” is far from the first film to contemplate objective versus subjective reality. Despite its heady eroticism, it maintains an almost clinical detachment that engages your mind without making your heart leap.",1,,,0

Set at the base of ravishing red cliff mountains, the city and its twin, Hildale, Utah, look straight out of Canaan. To watch “Prophet’s Prey,” Amy Berg’s tough and disturbing documentary about a secretive, polygamous Mormon fundamentalist sect with unsettling roots in the region, is to grasp, perhaps, the unspoken reason the Arizona tourism office seems to be suggesting that visitors drive right on by.The writer Jon Krakauer didn’t get the message. As he explains in “Prophet’s Prey,” his interest in these particular fundamentalists was sparked when, in 1999, he stopped at a gas station close to Colorado City and Hildale. There, he saw a group of women dressed in the sort of long prairie dresses that Laura Ingalls Wilder might have worn if she had liked frocks stitched out of pastel polyester. This curious sight led him on a journalistic investigation into Mormonism and its extremes, including the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (F.L.D.S.), a breakaway sect with thousands of polygamous true believers in the United States, Canada and Mexico. His book, “Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,” hit in 2003, but Mr. Krakauer, a guiding voice in the documentary, is still on the case.“Prophet’s Prey” was written and directed by Ms. Berg, whose earlier documentaries include “Deliver Us From Evil,” a contemporary horror story about Oliver O’Grady, a Roman Catholic priest and admitted pedophile who evaded punishment as he was moved from parish to parish for decades. He was finally defrocked and deported to Ireland, after doing time in prison.In “Prophet’s Prey,” Ms. Berg has found an eerie counterpart to Mr. O’Grady in the person of Warren Jeffs, a Mormon fundamentalist serving a life sentence for the sexual assault of two followers, including a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old he impregnated. By the time he was on trial, Mr. Jeffs was thought to have 78 wives, including 12 who were 15 or younger when they wed.The documentary tracks the rise and fall of Mr. Jeffs, who in 2002 assumed leadership of the church after the death of his father, Rulon Jeffs. With the on-camera assistance of Mr. Krakauer and Sam Brower, another dogged investigator, Ms. Berg fills in a harrowing portrait of Warren Jeffs as a deluded prophet and serial abuser, especially of girls and women who seem locked in another century. Their old-timey look will be familiar to fans of the HBO drama “Big Love,” about a polygamous family trying to find a middle way between faith and the modern world. In “Prophet’s Prey” there’s little evidence of love in what emerges as a tale of madness and abuse, wealth and criminality, mixed in with anti-government rhetoric — all in in the name of God.Drawing on archival material, landscape beauty shots and testimonials, including from former F.L.D.S. members, Ms. Berg has created an unnerving, sometimes infuriating documentary. She makes smart choices throughout as she weaves together this chronicle of faith and abuse, but her decision to include an audio recording that was used at Mr. Jeffs’s trial of him allegedly molesting a 12-year-old girl was wrong. This decision contrasts sharply with the scene in the documentary “Grizzly Man,” when an on-camera Werner Herzog listens to — but doesn’t share — an audio recording of the mauling death of two people. Mr. Herzog ratcheted up the drama by withholding the recording, but his decision was also a de facto ethical statement about documentary and the uses of the suffering of others.For the most part, though, Ms. Berg gets it right, burying Mr. Jeffs with persuasive witness testimony and documentation. Along the way, she gestures at larger, underexplored issues, including the rise of homegrown religious fundamentalism in the light of rights movements for women and children. Fundamentalist Mormons are having some kind of moment, including in cable shows like “Sister Wives” and documentaries like this one, which is based on Mr. Brower’s 2011 best seller of the same title. More movies are still to come, including an adaptation of “Under the Banner of Heaven” that is being developed by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, two of the executive producers of “Prophet’s Prey,” and written by a third executive producer, Dustin Lance Black, who wrote for “Big Love.” The story continues.",0,13532.0,,0

But this shockingly funny, weirdly touching custody battle between John Wood, the aggrieved amputee, and Shannon Whisnant, the fast-talking entrepreneur who unwittingly bought the appendage in a storage-unit auction, is as authentic as the North Carolina vernacular in which it unfolds.“Yeah, I saw it,” a police officer admits when asked about the leg, recalling Mr. Whisnant’s 911 call in 2007 to report his “plum nasty” find. “I just didn’t want to pick it up.” Mr. Whisnant had no such qualms, turning it — and himself — into a tourist attraction (“They want to see it, and watch the cholesterol drip out of it”) and denying Mr. Wood’s pleas to return his property, which had been severed in a plane crash.Yet the hicks-at-loggerheads story that was propagated by a snickering news media (and that is grasped, sometimes uneasily, by the directors, Bryan Carberry and Clay Tweel) veils a deeper, more resonant tale of fathers and sons and wounded feelings. And as hilarious graphics follow the limb’s bizarre journey from funeral home to Hardee’s drive-through, from embalmer to possum tree (don’t ask), those feelings push insistently against the desire to mock.Revealing its humanity slowly and a little tardily, “Finders Keepers” finally does justice to its dueling antiheroes, one addicted to attention and the other to multiple substances; one indulged and the other violently abused; one who finds himself and one who becomes increasingly lost.“Finders Keepers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

GOLD,"Review: ‘Unbranded,’ a 3,000-Mile Trek on Wild Horses","Combining adventure and advocacy, “Unbranded,” a documentary by Phillip Baribeau, follows four recent Texas A&M graduates as they ride 3,000 miles, from Mexico to Canada, using mustangs sprung from government corrals.The border-to-border expedition is conceived by Ben Masters, the lead rider, to encourage adoption of wild horses that are rounded up and held in Bureau of Land Management stables: That population is roughly 50,000, and growing. Without taking sides, “Unbranded” hears from ranchers whose livestock feeds on the same ranges; activists who feel the mustangs should be set free; and bureau officials who defend the federal policy.Mainly, though, Mr. Masters and his fellow Aggies are seeking an experience they’ll always remember: five months in the saddle, riding and camping and fishing and more riding, with a team of 16 mustangs. The route takes them through mostly public lands, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, and through heat and rain, snow and rivers, mountains and deserts. Terrain is often steep, trails do not always exist, and, early on, a horse might bolt.If there’s a disappointment, it’s that we get only glimpses of individual mustangs, just hints of their characters. A big attraction in films like this is also watching the bonds develop between man and animal, and “Unbranded” never does share much of that. (Nor of personal relationships: A last-day falling-out between Mr. Masters and another rider comes as a surprise.) What lingers, though, are stirring vistas of the backcountry West, and admiration — for the Aggies’ achievement, Mr. Masters’s imagination and Mr. Baribeau’s skill in chronicling it all.“Unbranded” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language along the dusty trail.",0,,,0

But with “Into the Woods,” you grow up with the characters, young and old, in a lifelong process of self-discovery.Directed by Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Nine”), this witty and touching mash-up of several Grimm fairy tales viewed through a post-Freudian prism reimagines Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy), Jack (of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” played by Daniel Huttlestone) and other fairy tale figures as complex, self-aware human beings in transition. Mr. Lapine’s screenplay follows them to “happily ever after,” then leaps ahead into territory that turns out to be the scary real world. Here, children weaned on fairy tales must finally abandon magical thinking.It is a world ravaged by catastrophe. The villain is an angry female giant (Frances de la Tour), who stomps through the land, wreaking random death and destruction. Lost and with no direction home, the survivors turn on one another, but quickly realize they have no choice but to stick together as they fend for themselves.Mr. Sondheim’s great song “No One Is Alone” is a double-edged lullaby. It acknowledges that everyone is ultimately alone, although the shared understanding of that isolation makes life bearable.The movie shows remarkably few signs of the sweetening and dumbing down that might have been expected, given the Disney factory’s philosophy of gratifying wishes but adding just enough darkness to make the light seem brighter. I suspect that the success of “Frozen” may have persuaded the company to modify its traditional formulas to allow more realism and ambiguity, which is all to the good.The movie gives us two princes, one for Cinderella, the other for Rapunzel. These preening dandies, played by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen, share the funniest song, “Agony,” in which they bellyache about the pain of the yet-unconsummated romantic chase as they cavort around a waterfall. Mr. Pine’s Prince is a direct forerunner of the caddish royal dreamboat in “Frozen,” and it’s reasonable to speculate that “Into the Woods” influenced his creation.Cinderella, beneath her facade of meek, abused scullery maid, is a schemer who strategically deposits a shoe on the palace steps while fleeing at midnight. With her avid glare and jack-o'-lantern smile, Ms. Kendrick is not a classic Cinderella, but a sly, modern go-getter plotting her future.A key player in the drama is a witch (Meryl Streep), who kidnapped Rapunzel, the baby sister of the baker who lives next door, and becomes a fiercely protective mother figure. The chubby, spunky Little Red Riding Hood steals pies from the bakery. There is a complicated history connecting these and other characters who wind up in the nearby forest, pursuing outlandish quests.Rapunzel and the witch are not the movie’s only parent and child in conflict. Jack and his strict mother (Tracey Ullman), irate that he traded a cow for some magic beans, are continually at odds. The characters closest to their fairy tale origins are Cinderella’s stepmother (Christine Baranski) and stepsisters, Florinda (Tammy Blanchard) and Lucinda (Lucy Punch). With the exception of the giant and a wolf (a sensational Johnny Depp) who stalks and devours Little Red Riding Hood, these mean girls and their avaricious mom are the only genuine baddies.Everyone else is shaded somewhere between good and evil. Even Ms. Streep’s vindictive hag is not entirely wicked. When a curse is lifted, and her beauty is restored, she is a dead ringer for Miranda Priestly, Ms. Streep’s regal fashion maven in “The Devil Wears Prada.” Ms. Streep’s warm performance gives the witch, even at her most fearsome, a twinkle of good humor that draws you to her. And her climactic meltdown, “Last Midnight,” is a vocal and dramatic tour de force.“Into the Woods” has just enough carefully chosen computer-generated effects to give it the feel of a semi-animated film without going overboard. In Dennis Gassner’s production design, the forest in which most of the action takes place is suffused with magic. The witch materializes and vanishes in leafy whirlwinds. The gnarly trees almost have personalities of their own. The shafts of sunlight filtering through the forest lend it a glow of heavenly illumination.Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Lapine, the wizards pulling the strings, are behind-the-scenes Prosperos conjuring magic. Even after the story darkens, Mr. Lapine’s book sustains enough humor to prevent the tone from sounding pedantic. Late in the movie, Cinderella’s vain, clueless prince apologizes for his dalliance (with the Baker’s Wife) by explaining, “I was raised to be charming, not sincere.”The Sondheim lyrics do much of the storytelling, with their dense wordplay and ingenious internal rhymes that verge on a Broadway equivalent of rap. The title number, a pastiche of the early-20th-century song “Teddy Bears’ Picnic,” establishes the innocent, carefree springboard from which everything else leaps. The one major song missing, the heartbreaking “No More,” alas, is heard only briefly as an instrumental. Gloriously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick, the gorgeous music has never sounded more eloquent.And “Children Will Listen” distills what might be called the gospel according to Sondheim:Careful the things you say,Children will listen.Careful the things you do,Children will see.And learn.We are listening.“Into the Woods” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

As if to suggest that this paradisiacal state of affairs has a sinful side, Erik Skjoldbjaerg’s murky thriller “Pioneer” rolls out a plodding tale of corruption during an oil extraction project in the early 1980s.On a training dive, Petter (Aksel Hennie) sees his brother die, apparently because of human error. His nosing around leads to an awkwardness with management and his being locked into a pressure chamber. He suspects its air supply is tainted, which means that a humble gas canister becomes a hotly disputed piece of evidence.With its whom-do-you-trust plotting, Mr. Skjoldbjaerg’s fight-the-power film plays like too many stories of corporate malfeasance. The gray look suggests the view through the thick spectacles worn by one of Petter’s colleagues; shots are partly obscured or all too faithful to the cramped environment of oil workers.Mr. Hennie, who starred in Morten Tyldum’s “Headhunters,” gets stuck on a couple of beleaguered facial expressions. (Wes Bentley, as an American oil worker, keeps popping up to surprise Petter and glower.) Mr. Skjoldbjaerg, who also tapped Norwegian history with his bank robbery re-enactment “Nokas,” doesn’t convey a creeping atmosphere of moral rot so much as an irksome glumness.“Pioneer” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language.",0,4233.0,,1

Here, the mix is one part outlaw buddy film with one part romance, served with songs and twists.If “Kill Dil” (“dil” means heart in Hindi) breaks no new ground, its twists are worth considering. In the opening sequences, we meet two orphaned boys raised on the wrong side of the law (“breast fed on gulps of blood”). They quickly grow up to be killers played by movie stars (Ranveer Singh and Ali Zafar, underused in a glowering, change-of-pace role), their hair bouncing prettily as they run from crime to crime. Like many recent Hindi movies, “Kill Dil” asks the audience to admire its heroes’ outlaw gumption. But after the shoot-’em-up opener, the movie stops wanting us to applaud their violence.Instead, Dev (Mr. Singh) finds love, in the form of Disha (Parineeti Chopra), an educated woman with a referred-to but never-seen job of reforming criminals. (Hard to imagine she’s good at it. She has no clue about Dev.) Soon, Dev buries his gun and declares to his buddy Tutu (Mr. Zafar) and the heavens, “I’m tired of being bad.”Directed by Shaad Ali, “Kill Dil” is a production of Yash Raj Films, which mostly churns out candy-coated tales set in a fantasy India. But Mr. Ali’s movie has glimmers of reality and even of a social conscience. Dev, a grade-school dropout, has trouble finding work in the sleek office towers of the new economy. When he finally lands a job, his rickety office has pictures of Gandhi on the wall. And Dev and Tutu’s living quarters — on a roof with a view of a highway overpass, where the sky is always a muted, polluted yellow — might as well be in a different city from Disha’s glamorously suburban digs. “Kill Dil” has excellent songs by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, and one memorable, stakes-clarifying dance sequence that juxtaposes two styles: the macho moves of the criminals (led by Govinda) and the alluringly feminine ones of Disha’s world, where Dev is playing hooky. It’s easy to know which side to root for.",0,98105.0,,0

O. SCOTT,"Marriage Is Hard, Physics Is Easy","“The Theory of Everything,” James Marsh’s biographical film about the British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, tries very hard to live up to its title: It wants to show a remarkable man in full, to explore his ideas, his emotional life and his struggle with illness. The material could hardly be richer. Mr. Hawking is both an important scientist and a fixture of popular culture, the author of best-selling books that seek to explain concepts comprehensible only to specialists. In his 20s, while still a graduate student at Cambridge, he learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease and, in the movie’s preferred phrase, a motor neuron disorder). Given two years to live, he completed his doctorate and married Jane Wilde, a fellow graduate student (in European literature) with whom he had three children.Jane Hawking’s memoir, “Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen,” is the film’s primary source (the screenplay is by Anthony McCarten), and “The Theory of Everything” is, above all, the portrait of a marriage. Jane, played with winning pluck and gravity by Felicity Jones, falls in love with Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) in the early 1960s, when he presents a charming mixture of gawky diffidence and supreme intellectual self-confidence. Surrounded by friends and an indulgent mentor (David Thewlis), he sets out to fathom the origins of the universe and locate the beginning of time.Later, he will reverse himself and propose a boundaryless, beginningless cosmos. In the meantime, his illness will test Jane’s resourcefulness, pulling her away from her own work and causing her much stress and worry. In her frustration, she turns to Jonathan (Charlie Cox), a kind and handsome choir director and music teacher who also helps out with Stephen and the children. The movie is poignant and honest in showing how Jane and Stephen’s marriage leaves both of them exhausted and unfulfilled.As Jane must sometimes literally carry her husband, so does Ms. Jones carry the movie, knitting her brows, setting her jaw and rationing tears and tremors of emotion with proper English discretion. Mr. Redmayne, hunched into a wheelchair, the muscles of his face spread into what looks like a permanent smile, must communicate his character’s feelings almost entirely with his eyes, which are remarkably expressive, conveying Stephen’s mischievous wit as well as his intelligence. But it is in showing the application of that intelligence that “The Theory of Everything” tumbles into a black hole of biopic banality. My colleague Dennis Overbye recently enumerated some of the film’s historical and scientific lapses in The New York Times, but those are not really my concern. Taking liberties with facts is a prerogative of storytelling. The greater failing is that Mr. Marsh, whose previous work includes the excellent documentary “Project Nim,” about an experiment into the linguistic capacities of a chimpanzee, seems in this case unable to capture the spirit and energy of scientific inquiry.The substance of Stephen’s work is shoehorned into a few compressed, overly dramatic scenes. Equations are scribbled on chalkboards. Fellow physicists proclaim, “It’s brilliant!” or “It’s rubbish!” One of Stephen’s friends diagrams a hypothesis in beer foam on a pub table. Several earnest, potted conversations take place about whether Stephen believes in God, as his wife does. But nothing establishes the stakes in these arguments or dramatizes the drive for knowledge.Movies often have a hard time with science, as they do with art. It is a challenge to show how intuition and inspiration yield insight and creativity, and to capture abstractions in a literal-minded medium. But it isn’t impossible. And in the case of Stephen Hawking, whose “A Brief History of Time” is an enormously popular, widely read account of highly complex thinking, this feat has already been accomplished, by Errol Morris, in a fascinating 1992 documentary. For that matter, Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” provides a livelier and more coherent exploration of the physics of time and space than Mr. Marsh’s film.Yes, “The Theory of Everything” has a different emphasis. But like so many cinematic lives of the famous, it loses track of the source of its subject’s fame. Its Stephen Hawking is a man who endured a terrible affliction and married a heroically patient woman and also accomplished something remarkable enough to put him on the cover of magazines and earn a medal from the queen. That something, though, remains beyond the audience’s grasp, which means that in a fundamental sense, everything has been left out. “The Theory of Everything” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"Manly? Yes, in That Present-Day British Way","It is about time we addressed the crisis of British manhood. The once proud nation that in the last century gave us such vital and varied paragons of masculinity as Winston Churchill, Laurence Olivier, Mick Jagger and Morrissey is now represented in the popular imagination mainly by rabbity, passive-aggressive stammerers. With all due respect — or maybe just, sort of, well, just the tiniest smidgen of due respect, if you see what I mean — to Hugh Grant, it all seems to be his fault. When he sweet-talked Julia Roberts in “Notting Hill,” the whole world swooned, and the sun slid further below the horizon of John Bull’s manly old empire.Fourteen years later, the extent of the decline can be measured in “About Time,” a flimsy bit of mildly romantic, putatively comic Anglophile bait from the writer of “Notting Hill,” Richard Curtis. Mr. Grant himself does not appear in the movie, but the leading man, Domhnall Gleeson, delivers a remarkably faithful impression of his mannerisms and vocal inflections.Mr. Gleeson plays Tim, who introduces us to his family, a painstakingly assembled collection of eccentrics living in a Cornwall mansion just shabby enough not to be ostentatious. The male line, represented by Tim and his dad (Bill Nighy), is characterized by negligible body fat and the kind of reflexive sarcasm that would seem cruel if these were not such evidently decent chaps. Father and son also share a special endowment that gives the film its gauzy, gimmicky premise. Like the other men in their family — and only the men — they are able to travel in time.Not crazy “Bill & Ted” or “Doctor Who” stuff, mind you, but sensible, modest little jaunts, always backward and for strictly personal reasons. (“No killing Hitler or that sort of thing.”) Dad, who cautions against taking advantage of this ability for selfish purposes, uses it to catch up on his reading. Tim decides that he will use it in the service of love. His trial-and-error courtship of a houseguest named Charlotte (Margot Robbie) prepares him for his pursuit and eventual conquest of Mary (Rachel McAdams), a lovely American he meets for the first time at a London restaurant.An amusing complication requires him to go back and meet her for the first time again, and his own insecurity compels him to repeat their first night together until he gets everything just right. This is gallant, perhaps, but also a bit creepy. Time travel is always kept secret from the ladies, whose superpower is to pretend to be exasperated with men they unreservedly adore. This works for Mary, and for Tim’s mother (Lindsay Duncan). His sister, Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson), is a sadder case. Her whimsy and cleverness lead her to alcoholism and a bad boyfriend, and it falls to her brother to rescue her from the consequences of her choices.Kit Kat’s unhappy circumstances at least lend a bit of drama to a film that seems almost militant in its complacency. Its ideal of perfect happiness — Tim’s goal — is the dull, frictionless bliss of television commercials in which people are good-looking and superficially clever without actually being interesting. Occasional bouts of sorrow or uncertainty make Tim a better person: not just better than his old self, but also better (in spite of his stammering demurrals) than everybody else. Including you.This does not make him especially winning company, though Ms. McAdams endures both him and an unfortunate hairstyle with her usual aplomb. (What is her thing with temporal wanderers, by the way? First there was Eric Bana in “The Time Traveler’s Wife,” then Owen Wilson in “Midnight in Paris.” Now this.) Mr. Nighy and Tom Hollander (as a playwright pal of Tim’s father’s) provide a bit of old-school grumpiness (though not enough), and Joshua McGuire (as a tongue-tied co-worker of Tim’s) suggests frontiers of diffidence yet to be conquered.The self-satisfaction that “About Time” radiates is so strong that it eclipses any curiosity the audience might bring. You may wish, when it’s over, that you could borrow Tim’s skill, reclaim the two hours and buy a ticket for something else. (You have a lot of good choices at the moment.) Not that it really makes a difference. By the time you get home from the multiplex, it will be as if the whole thing never happened. “About Time” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A bit of swearing and sex, mostly discreet and well mannered.",0,18472384.0,15323921.0,0

Tracking down survivors and family members (including Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the Long Island Democrat who channeled the loss of her husband and the wounding of her son into a successful congressional campaign and a fight for gun control), Mr. Minn constructs a quietly intimate memorial around their traumatic recollections.Mirroring this calm testimony, Mr. Minn favors muted re-enactments over horrific images and straightforward witness accounts over melodramatic narration. Interviewees from law enforcement are equally restrained, though the defense lawyer Ronald L. Kuby’s high-energy comments — as well as fascinating film of Mr. Ferguson’s bizarre performance at his 1995 trial — add momentum to a film that can sometimes feel becalmed by grief.Respectful and thorough, this unembellished true-crime story might have only regional appeal, but its depressing reminder of our failure to prevent similar calamities will resonate nationwide.",0,,,1

Per an unnecessarily overloaded premise (the film is adapted from a popular novel about the Internet, “Human Flesh Search”), the source of her irritability is unimpeachable: a diagnosis of cancer. The witness’s sister, a journalist and producer (Yao Chen, a social-media phenomenon in China), picks up the story but does not know that her live-in boyfriend (Mark Chao) has been hired by Ye as a companion for her last days on earth. Meanwhile, Ye’s understanding but imperious boss (Wang Xueqi) lords it over his wife (Chen Hong) after she tries to turn the screws over suspected hanky-panky with Ye.The older couple’s relationship, a brooding face-off played out in the cold comfort of their well-appointed home, is overshadowed by choppily assembled intrigue and the martyrizing of Ye. Mr. Chen’s camera placement often feels too much like a bid to mix things up (as strained as some of the fireworks in the WikiLeaks feature “The Fifth Estate”), and the occasionally goofy soundtrack cues seem to have been bought in bulk. While the film tackles an admittedly slippery contemporary moment, its grasp is weakened by divided attentions and unwieldy approaches.",0,,,0

Whether debating Muslims in Canberra, Australia, or making rhetorical mincemeat of the archbishop of Sydney; bantering with Stephen Colbert in New York City; or holding forth at the 2012 Reason Rally in Washington, this genial tag team is photographed with the deference of star-struck teenagers. Train, cab and airplane journeys between locations are pointlessly recorded, as is Mr. Krauss’s spell in a makeup chair and the vibrant hue of his pink sneakers — as though to underscore their wearer’s nonconformity.Outspoken nonbelievers like Sarah Silverman and Ricky Gervais pop up occasionally to enliven this monotonous travelogue. But every time we’re in danger of becoming immersed in either scientist’s smoothly honed rebuttals of religion, we’re hustled along to the next fan forum on the chords of a bizarrely rock-centric soundtrack. Rather than allow Mr. Dawkins to expand, say, on his optimistic view that religion is now “a wounded animal,” Mr. Holwerda has constructed a film that merely resembles a promotional tour for Mr. Krauss’s latest book.Too slight to persuade, “The Unbelievers” is also too poorly made to entertain.

It is 1977, and the state, still in the throes of the blasé anything-goes spirit of the post-hippie era, is awash in imported drugs.Accompanied by her daughters, 13-year-old M J (Liana Liberato) and 7-year-old Shell (Ava Acres), Christina drives to Fort Lauderdale, where an old friend, Sandy (Drea de Matteo), has invited her to visit with the promise of a job. What begins as light housecleaning in the mansion of Sandy’s boss, the Captain (Lloyd Owen), soon turns into marijuana smuggling. Christina applies herself to this with a fearless dedication, whether on the Captain’s boat or by renting other pleasure craft for shipments. She pockets rolls of cash and has few qualms about the work, which she enjoys despite its risks. The Captain and his fellow smugglers are raffish slacker types who party hard in their spare time. Despite a rule never to mix business and pleasure, a mood of sexy camaraderie prevails.“Free Ride,” the feature film debut of Shana Betz, who wrote the screenplay, has the benefit of being the true story of a part of her childhood and is narrated by her alter-ego, the grown-up Shell. From top to bottom, it feels authentic, and its laid-back, nonjudgmental tone evokes the easygoing world of Jimmy Buffett songs celebrating how changes in latitude bring changes in attitude. Much of the movie seems bathed in the pink-grapefruit haze of a Florida sunset. Before long, Christina and the girls are moved from a seedy motel to a farmhouse with a barn that shelters a horse for M J but also doubles as a drug warehouse that the girls are forbidden to enter. The domestic drama focuses on Christina’s increasingly fraught relationship with the sullen, rebellious M J, who is itching for grown-up adventure and balks at having to take care of Shell while their mother is away on business. Their conflict comes to an ugly head after Christina allows M J to accompany a drug-addicted acquaintance, Rain (Brit Morgan), to a rock concert. Ms. Morgan’s Rain is a frighteningly accurate portrait of a bitter, superannuated groupie on the skids.“Free Ride” is shrewdly cast. Ms. Paquin balances her character’s two sides: the caring mother and the pragmatic working-class survivor who does what is necessary to survive. Cam Gigandet is equally believable as Ray, a shady, laid-back hunk with whom she flirts and who is the closest thing to a love interest. Ms. de Matteo is all sharp edges as the tough Sandy, who ominously disappears. That’s the thing about this world: People tend to vanish at the first sign of trouble.“Free Ride” offers an unsettling vision of a demimonde whose inhabitants live with the reality that there may be no tomorrow.",0,,,1

Willett), the gay teenager who narrates the satirical farce “G.B.F.” Tanner and his best friend, Brent (Paul Iacono), are classmates in an upscale suburban hotbed of adolescent social warfare that might as well be on Planet Q, for all its resemblance to an actual high school.Tanner is mortified when he is catapulted to the kind of notoriety Brent secretly covets, when a Guydar hookup app on his mislaid cellphone reveals his sexuality. That accidental outing coincides with the moment that a popular teenage magazine proclaims a gay best friend, or “G.B.F.,” to be latest must-have mean-girl accessory.Overnight, the shy, drab Tanner is besieged by attention from the stereotypical “queen bitches” (his words) who lead the school’s three major cliques. Here’s how he describes them: Fawcett (Sasha Pieterse) is “by far the hottest girl in school and empress of the rich and the popular”; ’Shley, short for Ashley (Andrea Bowen), “with her perpetually sunny Mormon disposition, rules all wearers of shiny gold crosses and goody-two-shoes”; and Caprice Winters (Xosha Roquemore), a haughty African-American goddess, is “the queen of drama.”“Like neighboring warlords in a third world country,” Tanner observes, “they maintained an uneasy balance of power.”Banding together while vying for Tanner’s favor, they engineer their pet gay boy’s makeover into a fashionable dude in sunglasses, bow tie and tight pants, strutting around with a girl on each arm, although his heart isn’t really in it. Fawning over Tanner, these alpha girls use their power to protect him from bullies. When Fawcett’s handsome, about-to-be-ex-boyfriend threatens to beat up Tanner, she warns him that his sex life will evaporate.“I know things, like tiny, pinkie-size details,” she tells the boyfriend.He replies, “You wouldn’t dare.”“Try me,” she says.“G.B.F.,” directed by Darren Stein (“Jawbreaker”) from a screenplay by George Northy, is a mildly amusing live-action cartoon that camouflages its roiling sexual politics under a thick veneer of farce, larded with brazen innuendo. Unlike such forerunners as “Clueless” and “Mean Girls,” however, this movie, doesn’t have a believable moment in it. “G.B.F.” works its concept to death as its silly story builds to a prom scene that revolves around a tepid, underwhelming homage to “Carrie.”If the well-coordinated performances are decent caricatures, none are outstanding. The best moments belong to Megan Mullally as the closeted Brent’s overly supportive mother, who arranges a television marathon of gay movies for them to watch together and offers her running commentary on “Brokeback Mountain.” In a cringe-worthy moment, she even advises her son, “Get it together, girl.”“G.B.F.” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual references and double entendres.",0,,,0

What is surprising is that while the patchwork whole creaks terribly in places, the parts also show signs of life.Based on Richelle Mead’s young-adult juggernaut, the movie cherry-picks components from the vampire mythology and repurposes them for mainstream appeal. There are fangs, blood and death here, but also loads of drama, school rivalries and super-cute guys with anguished haircuts. The good vampires, the Moroi, may drink blood, but they’re also magical and, ridiculously, mortal. They can walk in the sun, although it helps to have gloves, shades and a fetching parasol. The Moroi aren’t your great-grandmother’s Transylvania exotics, slipping like mist through open windows after dark: They’re thoroughly modern, civilized types who meet their sanguineous needs by drinking from human volunteers in a gleaming white facility that’s the vampire equivalent of a juice bar. ImageZoey Deutch portrays the guardian to a princess.CreditWeinstein CompanyThe story centers on the teenage besties Rose (Zoey Deutch) and Lissa (Lucy Fry), who are bonded by blood and narrative contrivance. Rose is a half-human and half-vampire called a Dhampir, and the guardian in training for Lissa, a Moroi princess. When the movie opens, Rose and Lissa are on the lam, having run away sometime earlier from their school, St. Vladimir’s Academy, because of some kind of complicated threat. They’re soon hauled back to school by some men in black, including a stud with a ponytail, Dimitri (an appealing Danila Kozlovsky), though after fending off a gaggle of bad vampires. These are the resident villains, the Strigoi, immortals whose red eyes suggest cheap special effects and hangovers. The Strigoi are trouble, but less so than some of the other kids.There’s more, although the soap-opera details of who did what and why to whom are formulaic and uninvolving. Mark Waters (who directed “Mean Girls” and “Freaky Friday”; Daniel wrote “Heathers”) doesn’t seem especially interested in the supernatural parts of “Vampire Academy,” and he clearly didn’t have the budget to make what little hocus-pocus there is magical. He doesn’t do much with the camera, but he manages the material with a winking irreverence that makes the movie breeze right along. And as Mr. Waters has in the past, he brings a conspicuous sympathetic touch to his handling of the younger performers, especially Ms. Deutch and Ms. Fry, but also Sarah Hyland as a school misfit and Dominic Sherwood as the regulation darkly brooding beauty. “Vampire Academy” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

He doesn’t have an especially rubbery mouth, the kind that Jerry Lewis could stretch until it almost snapped, nor does it curl with the puckered elasticity displayed in the poster for “Bad Words,” a comedy about a guy who crashes children’s spelling bees. Sometimes, he just opens wide, and out pops an expletive. At other times, he turns his nice-guy face toward the target, pauses for a beat or two while he sizes up the opposition — maybe sends out a decoy, like a faint smile or a deceptively inviting word — and then he slashes and burns. The kids take it hard.One of the givens in “Bad Words,” a would-be gonzo comedy with a tough exterior and a marshmallow center, is that there’s something funny about making children cry. Squeezing tears is a talent that Mr. Bateman’s bullying 40-year-old, Guy Trilby, has perfected as the unwelcome participant and universally loathed champion in a national spelling bee where everyone else is decades younger. He has his reasons, because, well, everyone does. (He’s wormed his way in through a loophole by claiming to have never graduated from the eighth grade.) Guy is a smarty-pants even if he’s not as clever as he thinks. By the time he comes clean about his dirty words and deeds near the end, you may have already spelled O-e-d-i-p-a-l and moved on to p-s-y-c-h-o-b-a-b-b-l-e.It scarcely matters, because the point of a movie like “Bad Words” isn’t psychological nuance or philosophical profundity, but the secondhand pleasures that are supposed to come from irresistibly disreputable characters engaging in socially unacceptable behavior. That, at any rate, is the idea, as the movie, which Mr. Bateman directed, takes Guy from contest to contest, and he spells and smarms his way to another victory. Along the way, the recipients of his broadsides start to seem so specifically targeted that they could join any number of antidefamation groups. He jokes about one boy’s weight, tells a girl that she’s leaking menstrual blood before she takes the stage to compete, and quiets a hectoring mother by, among other digs, comparing her vagina to a “blown-out sweat sock.” ImageMr. Bateman with Mr. Chand in the comedy “Bad Words.”CreditSam Urdank/Focus FeaturesBy then, the movie has already started to soften, and Guy has begun hanging out with a chatty, sociable 10-year-old competitor, Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand, a scene-swiping moppet). They meet cute aboard an airplane to the spelling bee finale when Chaitanya introduces himself, and Guy tells him to point his “curry hole” elsewhere. This is followed by some back-and-forth, slap-and-tickle as Chaitanya, with what seems like pathological obstinacy, insists on befriending the surprisingly willing Guy. It’s an odd-couple hookup that, at least from a distance, could set off alarms, or would, if the movie, written by Andrew Dodge, were testing the borders of mainstream comedy instead of staying within its acceptable parameters. Ugly vagina jokes are O.K.; man-boy love jokes, ew, not so much. It would be something to see Mr. Bateman go authentically dark (perhaps not that dark), but it’s also enough just to watch him as he widens his eyes, furrows his brow and shows off his excellent timing. He does fine behind the camera, as well, even if with too many slow-motion interludes. But it’s a fluid feature-directing debut, and he pulls the ensemble together smoothly: The performances are funny, appealing and, in the case of Allison Janney, as a spelling bee official, wonderful. A dowdied-down Kathryn Hahn has it tougher as Jenny, a reporter who’s chasing Guy for his story and occasional sex. It’s a pathetic role, largely because she’s a sad piñata made for the whacking simply because, it seems, the only thing worse than making kids cry is being a journalist. “Bad Words” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Those who do will be rewarded, especially by the film’s outlandish final image.Craig (Pat Healy) is in the midst of a bad day, having been fired and received an eviction notice hours apart, and he’s wondering how he will support his wife and newborn son. In a bar, he encounters an old friend, Vince (Ethan Embry), and the two of them fall in with a couple (David Koechner and Sara Paxton) with odd tastes and an apparently limitless amount of money.The couple issue one dare after another to the two friends — punch a bouncer; spank a stripper — and pay off in wads of cash, the amounts increasing with the riskiness or distastefulness of the dare. Soon the lure of money has turned Craig and Vince against each other as they vie for the cash, and the dares become darker and bloodier.Mr. Koechner is terrific as the main instigator, and Mr. Healy does a pretty good job of transforming from wimpy family man to cutthroat competitor. E. L. Katz, the director, making his feature debut, has the courage to have everyone play it completely seriously. This is dark comedy indeed, and if viewed as such, it works deliciously.

It started in 1974, when he was given a bull penis as a joke, popped it in formaldehyde and decided it needed companions.“More and more penises kept coming into the house,” his wife, Jona, recalls, finally forcing her husband to put their tiny Icelandic village on the map by founding the world’s only Phallological Museum. Almost four decades after that initial gift, Mr. Hjartarson, a lifelong educator and thinker, was the happy curator of a collection (recently relocated to Reykjavik) featuring every mammal penis, bar one: that of “a proper human.”A little slow and a whole heap surreal, “The Final Member” documents the search for that last specimen with a twinkle in its eye and warmth in its tone. Neither mocking nor judging, the directors, Jonah Bekhor and Zach Math, present a story of escalating strangeness as two candidates — an Icelandic adventurer and legendary ladies’ man in his 90s, and a self-described California exhibitionist who calls his little friend “Elmo” — compete to display their manhood for posterity.While the Icelander frets over age-related shrinkage, and the much younger Californian plans a premature castration to beat his rival to the post, this wonderfully weird documentary pinpoints the desire to preserve fleeting glories. Like a glimpse into a dark and primitive cave, the film’s focus on the singular bond between a man and his privates will make women roll their eyes.

After all, he has succeeded beyond any sane person’s wildest dreams at building a comedy empire by holding a stinky finger to the racing pulse of the collective id. Like his fellow naughty boys Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who share his attitude of deadpan sarcasm, he knows full well that the human appetite for good-natured humor about bodily excretions and the messy area between the navel and the thighs is here to stay. It is primal farce, which, if we haven’t learned to accept it, will leave us permanently wrinkling our noses while the rest of the world goes on sniffing and chortling. And so we have Mr. MacFarlane playing Albert Stark, a cowering sheep farmer with a dirty mind, in his silly western spoof, “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” set in Arizona in 1882. This flighty comedy, which imagines itself a son of “Blazing Saddles,” demolishes the heroic mystique of the Old West with the nose-thumbing glee of a rambunctious brat who has just crawled out of a fetid mud puddle.It is also a descendant of the Bob Hope westerns “The Paleface” and “Son of Paleface,” Mr. MacFarlane being a disciple of Hope in spirit, if not in fact. Like Hope, Mr. MacFarlane is essentially a blank personality behind the facade of cynical, wisecracking toastmaster. As the host of the 2013 Oscars, Mr. MacFarlane presented himself as a potential Hope successor but lacked the comic timing and chutzpah to pull off the charade.Like Hope, Mr. MacFarlane implies that mischief can turn into mayhem at any second without letting his shell of bonhomie crack. It will take him years to build up the kind of good will that lent Hope’s presence an air of imperial unflappability that allowed him to transcend even the most embarrassing mishaps with the perfect wisecrack. So does “A Million Ways to Die in the West” certify Mr. MacFarlane as a bona fide movie star? It’s too soon to tell. He demonstrates enough confidence to emerge relatively unscathed from the movie, which he produced, directed and wrote (with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild), but he is far from imperial. At the same time, you wonder if someone else (maybe Jim Carrey) could have given Albert a stronger personality.The myth debunking begins immediately, as Albert, a glaring misfit in the frontier town of Old Stump, complains to anyone who will listen how much he hates the West. “We live in a terrible place and time,” he declares. “Everything that’s not you wants to kill you.” When enemies pursue Albert, he cowers inside a flock of his sheep.If the plot of “A Million Ways to Die in the West” isn’t as helter-skelter as a typical episode of “Family Guy,” the movie is really still a live-action spinoff of that cartoon, with different characters. It stays more or less on track until Albert accidentally overdoses on a psychedelic potion during a powwow with some friendly Apaches. The story springs off Albert’s breakup with his longtime girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried, stuck in a thankless role), who dumps him when he walks away from a gunfight. Albert’s best friend, Edward (Giovanni Ribisi), is a prim, virginal shoe repairman whose girlfriend, Ruth (Sarah Silverman), is a prostitute who services up to 15 clients a day. With the chirp of a naïve schoolgirl reciting the day’s events to her parents, she regales Edward with graphic accounts of her sexual exploits, to which he registers no reaction. Ruth insists that she and Edward not consummate their relationship until marriage because they are good Christians. ImageCharlize Theron plays an outlaw’s abused, gunslinging wife.CreditLorey Sebastian/Universal PicturesCharlize Theron plays Anna, the abused, gunslinging wife of Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), a notorious outlaw and leader of a gang that robs stagecoaches. Anna takes a shine to the meek Albert after he saves her in a bar fight, teaches him to shoot (he’s an inept student) and promises to help him win back Louise. But Louise has gravitated to the slick, mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), the richest man in town. A mustache, it turns out, is the ultimate male status symbol. Mr. Harris threatens to steal the movie with his portrayal of this vain, preening fop, a hissable baddie whose mug is plastered with a ridiculous, curling handlebar. That symbol even gets its own Broadway-style production number when a male chorus bursts into a revised version of Stephen Foster’s “The Moustache Song.” “A Million Ways to Die in the West” seems serious about only one thing: its contempt for the gun-crazed macho ethos exalted in countless Hollywood westerns. You might call the movie “Revenge of the Übernerd.” “A Million Ways to Die in the West” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for scatological humor.",0,37331031.0,,0

Or at least that’s how it registers. Segerstedt is remembered in history books for voicing opposition to Hitler, beginning in 1933, and Mr. Troell, a veteran filmmaker whose titles include “The Emigrants” and “The New Land,” clearly sees this protest as one man’s defining moment. Yet it’s one that also fights for attention with a family melodrama, a marital soap opera and many canine reaction shots. For the next few decades, Torgny keeps up the good fight, writing against both Nazism and what he sees as Sweden’s concessionary stance toward Germany, even during wartime. In between issuing denunciations, he juggles his depressed wife, Puste (Ulla Skoog), and his considerably more vivacious mistress, Maja (Pernilla August), a Jewish heiress who’s married to his paper’s genial, tolerant publisher, Axel (Bjorn Granath). Puste is sympathetic but a drag; Maya is unsympathetic but a bon vivant; the dogs are altogether charming. For a former theology student, Torgny, whose life has the geometric shape of two often overlapping triangles, comes off as almost rock ’n’ roll.It’s too bad that the movie can’t find his pulse and instead delivers a tastefully bland, inert portrait of a man whose personal ugliness it acknowledges without excavating. Although its black-and-white visuals catch the eye, “The Last Sentence” soon loosens its hold on your attention by flooding the story with mind-numbing, uninteresting details while real history slips through the cracks. Hitler invades Poland, Torgny walks his dogs, anti-Semitic caricatures arrive, Puste loses her grip: all receive more or less the same narrative weight, which means that none of them stick. The real Segerstedt died on March 31, 1945, a month before Hitler committed suicide in his bunker.",0,,62506.0,1

It’s not a bad fit.Donnie Yen, the Hong Kong action star (“Ip Man,” “Dragon”), plays Qinglong, a loyal commander of the Jinyiwei, the security force sworn to protect and serve the emperor. When the Jinyiwei’s leader colludes with the emperor’s uncle to try to stage a coup, Qinglong becomes a fugitive, heading to the rural outposts of imperial China. There our high-plains drifter is befriended by bandits and bodyguards and must confront the shape-shifting warrior woman Tuo Tuo (Kate Tsui), dispatched to kill him before he can foil the conspiracy.All this occurs amid covered wagons, campfires and horseback rides into the desert sunset by outlaws wearing wide-brimmed hats and serape-like shawls. About the only items missing are Colt revolvers, though gleaming swords and supercharged crossbows provide a high body count in meticulous wire-fu sequences that Sergio Leone never had to choreograph.The director, Daniel Lee, playfully throws in hints of “The Wild, Wild West” and “Batman” as he builds Qinglong into a conflicted, if mortal, superhero. Mr. Yen may not be the most emotive actor, but he does stoic well.

Their spree hits a snag when they run afoul of a gangster (Thomas Kretschmann), who wants two million pounds (about $3.28 million) to leave them alone.When you’re broke and short of time, there’s no place to go like Miami. “Plastic” is loosely based on a true story, but it borrows from countless other young-genius movies. Sam’s crew includes a loyal hacker (Will Poulter) and a traitor (Alfie Allen), who can’t be trusted with the stolen cards. Sam also recruits a fetching insider (Emma Rigby), who plans to parlay her share into medical care for her father.These aren’t just thieves; they’re the Robin Hoods of a spurned generation. The appeal of “Plastic” is in watching a con pulled off, as the gang deceives a jeweler (Graham McTavish) by impersonating a prince. The movie is easy on the eyes, with luxe, wide-screen Miami vistas and an exciting climactic chase, implausibly aided by the characters’ habit of planting tracking devices on one another. It’s hard to escape the sense that “Plastic” is itself a cheap knockoff, but the point is not to look too closely.

David (Rupert Evans), the protagonist of “The Canal,” is a film archivist, and his viewing of some newly donated footage sets this Irish horror story in motion. Not so much because that footage documents a grisly 1902 family blood bath, but because the murders took place in David’s house.When his wife (Hannah Hoekstra) disappears and is found drowned, David is the prime suspect. Yet a growing body of evidence suggests to him that it was the 1902 murderer, whose demonic spirit still lives in the house.The film is helped by an array of fine, low-key supporting performances, by Antonia Campbell-Hughes as David’s quiet (and possibly adoring) co-worker; Kelly Byrne as the baby-faced nanny; Anneke Blok as his mother-in-law; and Steve Oram as the cynical detective who never believes a word David says. And Calum Heath, as David’s baffled little son, Billy, is fantastic in a way that seems otherworldly but could be beginner’s luck.The film’s writer and director, Ivan Kavanagh, and his team pull off a few enjoyable, decently creepy scares, but over all, the action is too cryptic, and the pedestrian dialogue doesn’t help. Neither does the completely unconvincing “old film.” Still, there’s a hint of frisson, just enough to make you hope for a Hollywood remake.

43,2014-11-28,Citizenfour,"Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, William Binney, Jacob Appelbaum","USA, Germany, UK",Laura Poitras,"Documentary, Biography","English, Portuguese, German",88.0,114.0,,2014,8.1,46491.0,96.0,2017-11-02 04:18:20,A. O. SCOTT,Intent on Defying an All-Seeing Eye,"There are two ways to look at “Citizenfour,” Laura Poitras’s documentary about Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor whose revelations of widespread surveillance launched a hundred Op-Ed columns a year ago. The first and most obvious is as a piece of advocacy journalism, a goad to further argument about how security and transparency should be balanced in a democracy, about how governments abuse technology, about how official secrets are kept and exposed. The second is as a movie, an elegant and intelligent contribution to the flourishing genre of dystopian allegory.Those who regard Mr. Snowden as an unambiguous hero, risking his freedom and comfort to expose abuses of power, will find much to agree with in Ms. Poitras’s presentation of his actions. This film is an authorized portrait, made at its subject’s invitation. In 2013, Mr. Snowden, using encrypted email under the alias “citizen four,” contacted Ms. Poitras and the journalist Glenn Greenwald, inviting them to meet him in Hong Kong, where he would share what he had learned about the N.S.A.’s capacity to intercept data from the phone calls, emails and web wanderings of American citizens. When asked why he had chosen her, Mr. Snowden, his identity still electronically shrouded, replied that she had selected herself, based on her previous work as a journalist and filmmaker, including a short documentary about William Binney, an N.S.A. whistle-blower who also appears in “Citizenfour.” And “Citizenfour,” much of which consists of conversations between Mr. Snowden and Mr. Greenwald, emphasizes his bravery and his idealism, and the malignancy of the forces ranged against him. This is obviously a partial, partisan view, and several journalists on the national security and technology beats — among them Fred Kaplan at Slate and Michael Cohen (formerly of The Guardian) at The Daily Beast — have pointed out omissions and simplifications. Those criticisms, and George Packer’s long, respectful and skeptical profile of Ms. Poitras in a recent issue of The New Yorker, express the desire for a middle ground, a balance between the public right to know and the government’s need to collect intelligence in the fight against global terrorism.Fair enough, I guess. Such balance may be a journalistic shibboleth; it is not necessarily a cinematic virtue. “The Fifth Estate,” last year’s nondocumentary attempt to tell the story of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, bogged down in the pursuit of sensible moderation, losing the chance to write history in lightning.“Citizenfour,” happily, suffers no such fate. Cinema, even in the service of journalism, is always more than reporting, and focusing on what Ms. Poitras’s film is about risks ignoring what it is. It’s a tense and frightening thriller that blends the brisk globe-trotting of the “Bourne” movies with the spooky, atmospheric effects of a Japanese horror film. And it is also a primal political fable for the digital age, a real-time tableau of the confrontation between the individual and the state.Mr. Snowden’s face is by now well known — it has been printed on demonstrators’ masks and stylized posters — but when he first encounters Ms. Poitras and her camera, he is anonymous and invisible, a nervous young man in a Hong Kong hotel room. He is shy, pale and serious, explaining his actions and motives in a mixture of technical jargon and lofty moral rhetoric. While he seems almost naïve about the machinery of celebrity that is about to catch him in its gears, he is adamant in his desire to take public responsibility for his actions, partly to protect others who might be blamed. At the same time, he defers to Mr. Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, a reporter for The Guardian, about when, how and how much of the information he is passing on will be shared with their readers. Maybe some of this is ordinary-guy shtick, but it hardly matters. What makes Mr. Snowden fascinating — a great movie character, whatever you think of his cause — is the combination of diffidence, resolve and unpretentious intelligence that makes him so familiar. Slightly hipsterish, vaguely nerdy, with a trace of the coastal South in his voice (he was born in North Carolina and grew up mostly in Maryland), he is someone you might have seen at Starbucks or college or Bonnaroo. One of us, you might say.But if he is us, then who is them? The officials from the Obama and George W. Bush administrations who have defended the N.S.A. in court, before Congress and on television, promising that the rule of law and the rights of citizens are being respected, even as the bad guys are being chased down and spied upon? Those presidents themselves, who preach liberty even as they expand the prerogatives of the executive branch? The telecommunications executives who collude in the collection of data? All of the above, but maybe also not quite any of them. Plenty of movies have tried to imagine the contours of state power, but “Citizenfour” stands alone in evoking the modern state as an unseen, ubiquitous presence, an abstraction with enormous coercive resources at its disposal. To some extent, Ms. Poitras and Mr. Greenwald are engaged in a theoretical inquiry, a kind of speculative mapping, of the shape and reach of this mysterious entity. That is not to say that the United States government’s data collection program is not real, but rather that its extent and implications are only beginning to be understood.Mr. Greenwald, a prolific writer and prodigious talker (in Portuguese, too!), has made his case against secrecy and surveillance in numerous articles, blog posts, books and television appearances. Ms. Poitras, who does not appear on camera in her film and speaks only when reading Mr. Snowden’s emails to her, pursues a slightly different project. She deploys the tools of her trade — spooky music and fluid editing, subtle camera movements and suggestive compositions — to try to coax a specter into view.It is everywhere and nowhere, the leviathan whose belly is our native atmosphere. Mr. Snowden, unplugging the telephone in his room, hiding under a blanket when typing on his laptop, looking mildly panicked when a fire alarm is tested on his floor, can seem paranoid. He can also seem to be practicing a kind of avant-garde common sense. It’s hard to tell the difference, and thinking about the issues Ms. Poitras raises can induce a kind of epistemological vertigo. What do we know about what is known about us? Who knows it? Can we trust them? These questions are terrifying, and so is “Citizenfour.”“Citizenfour” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Not because of the nightmarish spectacle of unchecked state power, but because of the swearing it occasionally provokes.",1,,2785511.0,0

Though he doesn’t elaborate, his comment’s lack of detail and depth is typical of a film that plays more like a feature-length advertisement than like a documentary. You keep expecting the camera to zoom in on a packet of bacon or a box of cereal.A glance at the publicity notes, however, will tell you that this one-sided puff piece was “made with the generous support of the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance,” a trade association formed in response to films like “Food, Inc.” Smooth and folksy, it traffics in broad, unchallenged claims that serve a single purpose: to persuade us that the only thing wrong with today’s farming methods is our misinformed perception of them.Whipping up a down-home blend of horses, hills and communal meals, the director, James Moll, follows five men and one woman (an enterprising pistol who deserves her own movie) as they operate family-run enterprises. We learn that genetically modified organisms reduce the need for pesticides — which, one assures us, never reach the consumer — and that feeding growth hormones to chickens is a fiction. Counterclaims are absent (the film’s organic farmers are too polite to heave dirt on another’s methods), as is any discussion of corporate seed patents or government subsidies.Personable and hardworking, Mr. Moll’s subjects face the camera to bemoan fluctuating market prices and risky weather (but not climate change). The utility of sentiment is not overlooked, as one prepares for the birth of twins, and another mourns the loss of a patriarch. Audiences, however, will mostly be mourning the lack of an alternative viewpoint.",0,,,0

It was directed by Paul Greengrass, the British filmmaker who quickened the pulse of contemporary action cinema with the second and third installments in the Bourne franchise, features that proved yet again that big-screen thrills and thought need not be mutually exclusive. Kinetic action and intelligence are similarly the driving forces in “Captain Phillips,” which, like Mr. Greengrass’s Bourne movies, shakes you up first with its style and then with its ideas.The story is based on shivery, true events that unfolded in early April 2009, when four armed Somalis seized the Maersk Alabama, an American container ship under the command of Richard Phillips. The ship, with an unarmed crew of just 20 sailors, was hauling tons of cargo in hundreds of containers, including food from the United Nations World Food Program designated for African countries. To the Somalis, the ship apparently looked like a floating jackpot. What happened next played out in world news, and Captain Phillips went on to write, with Stephan Talty, a plodding, straightforward book with the telegraphing title “A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea.”“Captain Phillips” is based on “A Captain’s Duty,” and while they trace a similar narrative arc and share numerous details, they’re worlds apart in terms of sensibility. Written by Billy Ray (whose credits include “Shattered Glass”), it opens with a postcard-perfect shot of a white Vermont house. Inside, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is packing up and checking his route. He and his wife, a nurse, Andrea (Catherine Keener, who’s there to underscore Phillips’s decency), are soon on their way to the airport and murmuring about their children, the future and a fast, scarily changing world. There’s a stiltedness to their talk — and Mr. Hanks leads too hard with a broad Boston accent — yet the scene’s intimacy, and the couple’s vulnerabilities, immediately humanize Phillips.Mr. Greengrass likes to work fast. One minute Phillips is hugging his wife at the airport and the next he’s walking the decks of the Maersk Alabama, testing its unlocked security gates and running his crew through a safety drill. Almost as soon as the crew finishes the exercise, it’s confronted with a real-world threat: two rapidly approaching skiffs. Phillips and the crew dodge the skiffs by increasing their speed (the real ship’s speed topped out at 18 knots, or about 21 miles per hour) and shifting course to churn up destabilizing waves. Badly rocked, their jerry-built engines sputtering, the skiffs turn back, but the next day, one returns with four heavily armed Somali men. Led by Muse (the newcomer Barkhad Abdi, very, very fine), the Somalis board the Alabama, initiating a harrowing siege.At the time of the hijacking, a lot of the news reports focused on Captain Phillips and the nominal exoticism of a 21st-century piracy that had nothing to do with illegal downloads, football or Johnny Depp swashbuckling through a Disney franchise. The existential realities that inform contemporary Somali piracy turn out to be one of the unexpected themes of “Captain Phillips,” which begins as something of a procedural about men at work and morphs into a jittery thriller even as it also deepens, brilliantly, unexpectedly, into an unsettling look at global capitalism and American privilege and power. Phillips is unambiguously a heroic figure, but he’s scarcely the sole point of interest in a movie that steadily and almost stealthily asserts the agonized humanity of his captors.This humanization hits you like a jolt. The shock isn’t that the pirates are people, however corrupted. But that even as the movie’s rhythms quicken along with your own — Mr. Greengrass works you over like a deep-tissue pugilist with smash cuts, racing cameras and a propulsive soundtrack so you feel the urgency as well as see it — an argument is being created. There is, you realize, meaning here beyond the plot, meaning in the barren Somali hamlet in which Muse and his companions congregate under warlord gunpoint and in the razored angles of their startling, gaunt faces. There’s meaning, too, in the wild eyes and stained teeth of men who never eat, but stuff their thin cheeks with khat, the amphetaminelike plant that, among its uses, helps suppress the appetite. After the Somalis take over the Alabama, the action downshifts and the story settles uneasily into a tense standoff with Muse and Phillips now staring warily at each other across the ship’s bridge rather than across the water through binoculars. Mr. Hanks is one of the few movie stars who, like Gary Cooper once upon a Hollywood time, can convey a sense of old-fashioned American decency just by standing in the frame. There’s something so unforced about him that it can seem as if he’s not delivering a performance, just being Tom Hanks. This feeling of authenticity, however well honed and movie made, dovetails with Phillips’s gruff likability to create a portrait of a man trying to keep himself, his crew and his ship together even as the world he knew comes violently undone. That reality grows progressively more uneasy with the arrival of the American military, which descends with expected might in warships that loom over the crisis like idled, waiting giants. Throughout “Captain Phillips,” Mr. Greengrass plays with scale, proportion and camera angles to underscore the differences at play in the story; there’s an early aerial shot of Phillips walking on the deck of the Alabama and dwarfed by a ship that in turn drifts like a speck on the water. Later, these extremes accentuate the paradoxes of the story — the tiny Somalis scrambling aboard an enormous American ship — that grow more pointed and political, as when a group of hugely muscled Navy personnel arrive and begin gearing up for a finale in which there seem to be many Goliaths but no David.What comes after isn’t a surprise, even if “Captain Phillips,” which revs you up with frenzied action and violent spectacle, does surprise by denying you the usual action-movie high. Because just as the movie races toward its foregone conclusion, it also begins siphoning off the excitement it has been building up all along. The big men with the big guns do their part, but the skin-prickling, carnal excitement that almost inevitably comes with certain types of screen violence never manifests, replaced instead by dread, anxiety, a shaking man and whole a lot of blood. It’s the kind of blood that most movies avoid and that, Mr. Greengrass suggests, is what remains unseen in global traumas like this. Some viewers may pump their fists but, I think, he wants this victory to shatter you.“Captain Phillips” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘The Danish Girl,’ About a Transgender Pioneer","“The Danish Girl,” Tom Hooper’s new film, is a story of individual struggle that is also a portrait of a marriage. In this respect and others it resembles “The King’s Speech,” Mr. Hooper’s earlier historical drama, a multiple Oscar winner a few years ago. In that case, the union of George VI and Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, was the foundation on which the tale of George’s elocutionary striving was built. Here, the marriage is bohemian rather than aristocratic, but the stakes, while personal, are every bit as profound and consequential as the matters of state that drove the monarch to the microphone.When we first encounter Gerda and Einar Wegener, played by Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne, they seem perfectly matched. Both are painters, living amid the soft colors and sea air of Copenhagen in 1926. Gerda is a portraitist, while Einar’s landscapes — drawn from his childhood memories of the fjords and marshlands of Vejle, a town on the Jutland peninsula — have brought him a measure of fame. Like many couples who share a profession, they provide each other with support as well as a bit of competition. Their best friend, Ulla (Amber Heard), a dancer, marvels at their mutual devotion, which combines the easy, egalitarian warmth of friendship with the heat of sexual attraction.But their relationship turns out to rest on a false premise. Through a process that is by turns wrenching and exciting, Einar discovers that the man the world has always taken him to be is not the person he truly is. What begins as an experiment and a bit of a game — dressing as a woman for the Copenhagen artist’s ball, wearing one of Gerda’s camisoles under his clothes — becomes an existential transformation. For a while, Einar and Gerda pretend that Lili, his female persona, is Einar’s cousin, visiting Copenhagen from the countryside. Henrik (Ben Whishaw), a self-described “romantic,” falls in love with her. But Lili is not Einar in disguise: The truth is exactly the reverse.Written for the screen by Lucinda Coxon and based on David Ebershoff’s novel of the same title, “The Danish Girl” is a fictionalized biography of Lili Elbe (as Einar Wegener came to be known), one of the first people to attempt sex reassignment surgery. Lili’s encounters with prevailing medical wisdom, culminating in her meeting with a sympathetic doctor (Sebastian Koch), form a harrowing subplot. And her bravery makes this film a welcome tribute to a heroic forerunner of the current movement for transgender rights. It’s impossible not to be moved by Lili’s self-recognition and by her demand to be recognized by those who care most about her.But it’s also hard not to wish that “The Danish Girl” were a better movie, a more daring and emotionally open exploration of Lili’s emergence. As it is, the film, like its heroine for most of her life, is trapped by conventional expectations and ways of being. If, that is, Lili is really the heroine at all. The film’s title phrase is uttered on screen once, by Einar’s childhood friend Hans (Matthias Schoenaerts), a Paris art dealer, in reference to Gerda. And it is Gerda’s ordeal that provides the narrative with its emotional center of gravity.When “The Danish Girl” was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, Kyle Buchanan, writing for Vulture, complained that it was part of a trend of “queer and trans films that are actually about straight people.” Not that the emphasis on Gerda’s experience is illegitimate. She is called upon to support the man she loves as he erases himself from her life, and Ms. Vikander registers the anguish and ambivalence, as well as the passionate loyalty, that Gerda feels as Einar gives way to Lili.But unlike Jill Soloway’s Amazon series “Transparent,” which embeds gender transition in a dense and detailed weave of family relations, “The Danish Girl” takes place in the airless, elegant atmosphere of quality filmmaking. Every scene is wrapped around a neat nub of feeling. The dialogue is carefully balanced between modern sensibilities and the imaginary language of Fancy Old Europe, which is really just English spoken in a variety of lovely and heterogeneous accents.Mr. Hooper’s tasteful, earnest, didactic style — magnified by Alexandre Desplat’s decorously overwrought score — does the film no favors. And the asymmetry between the central performances doesn’t help, either. Mr. Redmayne is a master of technique, adept at significant gestures, freighted glances and the kind of showiness that masquerades as subtlety. As a result, the passage from Einar to Lili is almost entirely a matter of artifice and surface. Einar’s fingers brush against the ballerina’s dresses hanging in Ulla’s studio. Mr. Redmayne alters the angle of his neck, the rhythm of his walk, the timbre of his voice and the set of his mouth. It’s all very impressive, as it was when he traced the progress of Stephen Hawking’s neurological illness in “The Theory of Everything.” But like that much-praised performance, this one does not take us where we need to go, which is inside the character’s mind and spirit.Ms. Vikander, in contrast, acts from the inside out, with an openness and spontaneity that is especially rare in movies like this one. Whether she is painting, smoking, embracing her husband or offering her hand to the woman who replaces him, Gerda is the one figure onscreen who seems to breathe the sharp air of reality. The others have been painted, with practiced skill and impeccable intentions, by numbers. “The Danish Girl” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

They’re soon taken prisoner by moon men, but a quick-witted astronomer clobbers the king and they escape, with one earthling vanquishing moon men with an umbrella. Humans have been zapping extraterrestrials ever since. It’s so easy to fight the unknown, at least in movies.“Arrival” is a science-fiction parable in a distinctly more idealistic hopeful key than most movies in this genre, one in which the best solutions don’t necessarily materialize in a gun sight. It has a little action, a bit of violence and clenched-jawed jittery men. Mostly, it has ideas and hope, as well as eerie extraterrestrials who face off with a soulful linguist-heroine, Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the story’s voice of reason and its translator. She’s thoughtful, serious, at ease with her own silence and fears. She’d get along fine with Sandra Bullock’s character in “Gravity,” which like this movie leans into feeling and thinking, and reminds you again that there’s more to this genre than heavy artillery.The movie begins with an elliptical prelude that guides you in but is forgotten as soon as the aliens touch down minutes later. The director Denis Villeneuve teases his way through these preliminaries, with shots of newscasts and panicked crowds, revealing just enough to work up some excitement. In a sly preview to things and tall creatures to come, Louise keeps looking up — at a blaring television, at shrieking military jets — turning Ms. Adams’s pale face into a screen for the movie that’s just starting to come into view. She’s soon hustled off to the show run by the military (Forest Whitaker plays the good cop, Michael Stuhlbarg the bad), having been enlisted to interpret the alien tongue.Mr. Villeneuve likes big stories with big stakes, and he’s very skilled at working your nerves. In some of his movies, he punctures the stories with bluntly violent shocks — a stunned survivor seated before a burning truck in “Incendies,” corpses sealed inside a drug-house wall in “Sicario” — that distill terror into a grabber moment. These visuals can be real showstoppers (the narratives briefly shift into idle); they’re at once off-putting and unsettlingly seductive, and even if you want to look away, it can be hard to. Some of his limitations as a filmmaker are best expressed in the perfect crackling of those flames and the pictorial balance of that shot of walled-up torture victims.“Arrival” doesn’t need self-regarding jolts. It’s based on Ted Chiang’s “Story of Your Life,” one of those unassumingly smart science-fiction puzzles that blend absorbing storytelling with meditations on the universe, being, time and space. Part of what makes it so enjoyable is that Mr. Chiang not only raises questions about the nature of reality and what it is to be human, but he also embeds them in his writing through different verb tenses and times. In one section, he rummages around in the past; in another, he jumps onto a separate timeline. The movie — the script is by Eric Heisserer — does something similar with cutaways to Louise’s life, shardlike glimpses that help fill in the whole.Having been spirited away, Louise is moved into a makeshift military base in Montana, one of 12 locations across the globe where the aliens have dropped anchor. There, next to one of their enormous ships — a vessel that hovers over the ground and looks like an elongated black egg with one side neatly sliced off — she’s briefed and prepped amid furrowed brows, data crunching and intimations of the apocalypse. Once she settles in, the movie gets its groove on. The visitors have set up regular visiting hours for the humans, opening a portal through which a small team in hazmat suits can enter. As their machines whir, Louise and the rest gape across the cosmic divide and into the unknown.The scenes inside the alien ship are transporting. After Louise and her team move through the ship’s portal, they end up in a large chamber facing a luminous rectangle, a kind of window — it looks like a movie screen — through which they can see the aliens. But the room is also a type of a stage, an immersive theater that engages sight, sound and a sense of touch. Louise’s hands and voice quaver, but her eyes shine and widen as the pleasure of the new — and knowing — edges out fear. And when her physicist colleague, Ian (Jeremy Renner), runs a gloved hand over one of the ship’s textured black walls, his expression suggests the delight of a child at the moment of discovery.Mr. Villeneuve nods to “2001: A Space Odyssey” here and there in the astronaut-like hazmat suits, the allusions to the abyss (the humans sometimes float, as if in space) and of course the looming monoliths, one of them named Stanley Kubrick. These references can seem decorative, almost ritualistic, with one director paying homage to a master. “Arrival” isn’t a visionary movie, an intellectual rebus or a head movie; it’s pretty straight in some respects and sometimes fairly corny, with a visual design that’s lovely rather than landmark. And, as it revisits some of the uncertainties in “2001” — free will, extraterrestrials, God — it seems to turn inward instead of out. (It does both.)By turns inviting and opaque, Ms. Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near. In a nice reversal of how many puzzlers work, the movie becomes more fragmented the closer that Louise gets to figuring out why the aliens have arrived, what they want from Earth and why. Increasingly, her steadiness becomes the very foundation for the narrative, which serves its meaning beautifully. The movie complicates Mr. Chiang’s story, adding action scenes and political notes, which comes off as pretty puny compared with its larger, grander adventure about a woman who, in staring into the void, leaps into life and finds herself.“Arrival” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some gun action.

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘Lion’ Brings Tears for a Lost Boy, Wiped Dry by Google","The first part of “Lion,” Garth Davis’s unabashedly tear-jerking movie about a remarkable real-world incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a long-ago time — 1986, to be precise — before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar), who accidentally travels more than 1,000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta.Saroo’s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an out-of-service train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language.With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo’s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling.What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), who was also adopted from India and has mental health and substance-abuse problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the happily-ever-after stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara), from America.But memories of his long-ago life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It’s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you’re not familiar with the true story behind “Lion,” that the fairy tale will come true.Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O’Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child — or a mother — this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent.Still, it isn’t quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the grown-up Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that “Lion” doesn’t quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isn’t enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back.At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I can’t complain too much about that; for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also can’t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don’t-be-evil fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But we’ve lost something, too, and we can’t even see what it is.“Lion” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes.",0,51694854.0,51728731.0,0

Videotapes and the machines that play them are frequent props in the current crush of nostalgia for the 1980s and ’90s. The latest example is the horror movie “Beyond the Gates,” which shows early promise but eventually ends up in the bin of ordinariness.As the film opens, two brothers (Graham Skipper and Chase Williamson) are packing up their father’s old video-rental store. The director, Jackson Stewart, commendably takes his time getting to the scary stuff, spending a half-hour sketching out tensions between the brothers and planting doubts about what happened to the father, an alcoholic who has been missing for months.In their father’s office, the brothers find an old VCR board game, the kind that requires you to play a videotape that guides you through the game. Its onscreen hostess is played by Barbara Crampton, whose horror résumé goes back to the wonderfully demented 1985 film “Re-Animator,” and she’s fun to watch as she lures the brothers into a hellish alternate reality that requires them to play out the game to save their father’s trapped soul. By this point, though, a cheesiness has taken over the movie, squandering all that early potential. Getting retro right is harder than it seems.",0,,,1
51,2017-01-13,Live by Night,"Ben Affleck, Elle Fanning, Remo Girone, Brendan Gleeson",USA,Ben Affleck,"Action, Crime, Drama, Thriller","English, Spanish",49.0,129.0,"Ben Affleck (screenplay by), Dennis Lehane (based on the novel by)",2016,6.4,43961.0,35.0,2017-11-02 04:18:26,MANOHLA DARGIS,"Review: He Pledges Allegiance Only to His Tommy Gun, in ‘Live by Night’","In “Live by Night,” Ben Affleck plays one of those romanticized antiheroes that movie stars love to suit up for, sometimes with a fedora. Over the decades these types have changed their looks and histories, but there’s a sameness to how they escape the law and the routine hum of everyday life; how they use guns ruthlessly or reluctantly; skip out on church yet live by their own moral code; and inevitably rise to become masters of their worlds, as well as of the most beautiful women in the room. They’re fantasies of power partly because no matter how hard this type falls, his power never truly corrupts.That’s more or less what Mr. Affleck is hawking in “Live by Night,” a gangster movie set in the 1920s. He plays Joe Coughlin, a World War I veteran who’s returned from the war with a mouth full of tough-guy talk that basically boils down to, “I went away a soldier, I came home an outlaw.” Mr. Affleck recites this line with a gravelly hush, as if he were spilling a secret, but whatever Joe has learned in the bloody fields of Europe remains mostly obscured; what speaks loudly is his proficiency with a gun and the easy way in which he shoots at a man in a uniform, even if that man wears a badge.“Live by Night” is a messy, unfocused movie about ambition, lost ideals, corrupt men and a thief whose idea of life on his own terms means pulling the trigger. It has Tommy guns and Model T’s, luxuriously polished surfaces, some fine squealing-tire action and a handful of solid performances, including one from Sienna Miller, who tramps around as a 10-cents-a-dance cynic. But what’s most striking about the movie is its earnestness. Mr. Affleck isn’t playing with genre for kicks or as a knowing, reflexive exercise, but trying to pour new wine into a bullet-riddled vessel.This is harder to pull off than it looks, especially if — as Mr. Affleck does here — you’re trying to say something important about homegrown myths involving progress and exceptionalism. One hurdle is that our gangster movies are almost by definition about the dark side of the American dream, one that sexes up the Horatio Alger fairy tale with sin and violence only to then sometimes toss Horatio and his dream in the gutter. James Cagney machine-gunned his way to that dream in “The Public Enemy” in 1931. Decades later, an aggrieved father opened “The Godfather” with his own singular pledge of allegiance: “I believe in America.”Based on a Dennis Lehane novel that shares the same title, “Live by Night” tracks Joe from his early Boston crime sprees and Oedipal issues to his escalating involvement in a crime syndicate. (Brendan Gleeson pops up early on as Joe’s policeman father.) Joe eventually lands in Tampa, Fla., where he builds a Prohibition empire, tangles with the sheriff (Chris Cooper) and falls in love with a local attraction (Zoe Saldana) who changes his ideas about life. There are complications, involving the sheriff’s daughter (Elle Fanning), other gangsters and the Ku Klux Klan, all of which are crammed amid intrigues, locations, cinematic homages and too many self-flattering scenes for Mr. Affleck.Mr. Affleck handles the busy narrative without finding its hook, but his biggest problem is that he’s fallen for his leading man. He gave himself a good role in “Argo,” one of the earlier movies he directed (in the first, “Gone Baby Gone,” he stayed off camera). But in “Argo,” he was also embedded in that movie’s enjoyably loony complications and upstaged by a couple of world-class scene-stealers in Alan Arkin and John Goodman. In “Live by Night,” by contrast, Mr. Affleck grabs the center and doesn’t let go, partly, it seems, because he’s invested in being a movie star. (Certainly that’s the only rational explanation for “Batman v Superman,” other than the paycheck.)Joe’s rise becomes progressively lucrative, uglier and more brutal, but Mr. Affleck has never been an actor who can persuasively go for the jugular and he can’t help but smooth the rough edges. This softening undercuts some of Mr. Affleck’s big moments, as when Joe faces down a Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, a scene that ends up feeling more about affirming Joe’s superiority than advancing the story. At that moment and elsewhere, Joe scarcely seems the complex, conflicted man who lives by night even as he’s increasingly drawn into the day. He comes off like a different fantasy, one that’s a shotgun wedding between 20th-century pulp clichés and 21st-century elevated political consciousness.Such moments weigh down “Live by Night,” making its heaviness ponderous. At the same time, there’s something appealing in how Mr. Affleck comes at the gangster genre and how this story departs from the tribal affiliations of films like “The Departed” toward a more pluralistic vision in tune with both today’s and yesterday’s United States. In “Live by Night,” Joe ends up thriving in a mixed neighborhood and rubbing elbows with people of different hues, yet this is scarcely an advertisement for so-called political correctness. If anything, he’s just another regular Joe, robbing, killing and swaggering his way to the American dream one bullet at a time.",0,10377558.0,10378555.0,1

He brought his earnest voice and moody guitar into the 1960s counterculture when he was in his early 30s, and he made a substantial impact musically well into the 1970s. In that time, he was a cult artist on a very large scale, so to speak. But after the explosive popularity of his oft-covered 1984 song, “Hallelujah,” and a management swindle that obliged him to become a road dog to restore his income, he became an arena-filling legend and, to his hard-core fans, a prophet.“Leonard Cohen: Bird on a Wire” is an account of a particularly fraught period in the first phase of his stardom. Directed by the British documentarian Tony Palmer, it follows Mr. Cohen and his small band — two guitarists; a bass and fiddle player; Bob Johnston, the Nashville record producer and musical near-anarchist; and the backup singers Donna Washburn and Jennifer Warnes — on a spring 1972 tour of Europe that ended in Israel. It’s a time Mr. Cohen later described as “confused and directionless.”The movie was completed in 1974, subsequently revised (the current print contains an in-memory-of dedication to Mr. Cohen’s longtime lawyer, Marty Machat, who appears in the film and died in 1988), and only now is having a theatrical release. It follows the outline for road music documentaries that was later successfully sent up by “This Is Spinal Tap.” Mr. Cohen granted extraordinary access to Mr. Palmer and his crew. There’s footage of Mr. Cohen and his male band mates showering, even. During one backstage meet-and-greet, Mr. Cohen is baldly propositioned by a female fan, and he demurs with a combination of gentlemanly grace and camera-conscious awkwardness. He is polite and witty with interviewers. When one of them says of Mr. Johnston, “I didn’t know he was an organist,” Mr. Cohen replies, “He’s hardly aware of it himself.”The artist’s lightheartedness, which might have been forced to begin with — while always a remarkable live performer, in the early part of his career, Mr. Cohen was also an often reluctant one — cannot hold. Technical problems plague the shows, as amplifiers unexpectedly feed back, demolishing the contemplative simplicity of the music. There’s a tense confrontation with some truculent, dissatisfied fans in Berlin. Mr. Cohen’s self-deprecating humor begins to take an edge. One night he strums his guitar and sings “Leonard Cohen/[strum]/is going to sing his songs/[strum]/of anguish and despair.” And on the last night of the tour, in Jerusalem, the artist crashes emotionally, and the question of whether he will rally provides some suspense.Mr. Palmer captures all this with a keen eye. The movie is a worthy time capsule and a must for Cohen devotees. Its occasional meanderings into artiness, which take the form of interpolation of outside footage (war atrocities and home movies, mainly) are emblematic of the time it was made and mercifully brief.",1,,,1

The enervating, would-be laugh-in “The Comedian” opens this week, presumably on the strength of its headliner, Robert De Niro. He’s ill-served by this movie, but he’s been worse elsewhere, which isn’t much of a comfort as this one drags into hour two. Like every exalted star, Mr. De Niro generates good will because of who he is and despite his ups and downs, the afterglow of his great performances enveloping him like a luminous cloud. So it takes a significantly bad movie to wipe the audience’s smile off this fast.The setup sounds promising. Mr. De Niro plays Jackie Burke, a stand-up and ex-sitcom star on a downward slide. He’s not killing it the way he once did, and it takes only a few minutes onstage to see why: “Let’s talk about this abortion of a town you live in,” he tells one crowd. That’s his way of warming up the room, but the chill remains palpable. Jackie is an insult comic, but his barbs have no edge, no zing, no wit. (It’s unclear if they ever did.) Early on he gets a break after he attacks a heckler and the assault becomes a YouTube sensation, notoriety that earns him brief jail time and new attention.Jail turns out to be a blip on Jackie’s modest, wobbly career upswing, beginning at a cable station where he and his enduringly patient agent, Miller (Edie Falco), meet the enemy: the younger generation. It’s a nowhere scene, but worth mentioning because it introduces a generational divide and a patronizing attitude toward women that winds throughout. The cable executive turns out to be a tough chick, Carol (Beth Malone), a brittle smiler with short hair who puts her feet up on the table where her eager minions sit like schoolkids. The meeting is a wash (it plays like a metaphor for Hollywood), but is soon forgotten down at the soup kitchen, where Jackie is doing community service.There’s a lot of story, but mostly the filmmakers rack up the miles and Jackie wears through shoe leather moving from here to there. At the soup kitchen, he finds a sympathetic (and hostage) audience in the homeless clientele and a counterweight to the cable executive in Harmony (Leslie Mann), who’s also doing community service. Ms. Mann giggles and laughs too much, which fits Harmony’s role as a prop. She exists to humanize Jackie, hoot at his groaners and, in one scene, gaze adoringly at him while at his feet. She beds him because she has daddy issues; their age difference suggests that the filmmakers share those issues. Mr. De Niro’s old pal, Harvey Keitel, plays papa.The director, Taylor Hackford, never makes any of this pop, which isn’t a surprise given the material. He also doesn’t give you much to look at other than street scenery and Mr. De Niro’s mug, which the actor bunches up while cycling through soft, sour moods (aggravated, exasperated), occasionally dropping a smile that might as well be a frown. It took a near-village to write the script, which is credited to Art Linson, the stand-up Jeff Ross, Richard LaGravenese and Lewis Friedman. (The stand-up Jessica Kirson, who appears in the movie, was a consultant.) Billy Crystal shows up for a heartbeat; Jimmy Walker, Charles Grodin, Richard Belzer and Cloris Leachman hang out a touch longer.Every now and then, as when Jackie is onstage — isolated in the harsh lighting and facing down a show-me world that has become increasingly foreign to him — you can see the movie that “The Comedian” might have been. There’s a kernel of an idea here about an older performer struggling to be funny in a changed reality (its technology, its women), but to pull that off would require true, deeply felt hostility, something this movie doesn’t want or can’t risk. Jackie isn’t tough enough because the movie isn’t, so his comedic personality never gels. He’s meant to be an insult comic, but his discontent only rises to genuine anger with physical violence. His is the wrong kind of punch.",0,,,0

SCOTT,Review: ‘A Cure for Wellness’ Is a Riot of Film References. With Eels.,"Outside of a sushi context, I don’t usually spend much time thinking about eels, but “A Cure for Wellness” gave me no choice. Ever since the screening, I’ve been wondering about those slithery creatures, which you may have noticed in the trailers and the posters, where a bunch of them share a bathtub with Mia Goth, one of the movie’s stars.Not wondering in the “What does it mean?” sense, mind you. Anyone who has even a slight acquaintance with Freudian theory or Japanese erotica will grasp the psychosexual significance of those eels, who live in the aquifer underneath an Alpine spa and occasionally make their way into the plumbing and beyond. My questions are of a more basic nature: How did they get down there in the first place? Are they an invasive species or part of the native ecosystem? What evolutionary process might account for their curiously symbiotic relationship with the spa’s human residents?It would be unfair to blame the director, Gore Verbinski, or the screenwriter, Justin Haythe, for declining to provide a thorough explanation. “A Cure for Wellness” defiantly and splendidly flouts the tenets of plausibility and coherence, which have never interested Mr. Verbinski very much. His résumé, after all, includes “The Lone Ranger” (also written by Mr. Haythe), “Rango” and, most notably, the first three “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies. He comes by his knack for enjoyable nonsense as honestly as his taste for aquatic fauna.The eels may be the key to the puzzle posed by his latest project, or they may be (forgive me) a red herring. Maybe it would be best to drop the piscatory metaphors altogether. “A Cure for Wellness” is a lustrous box of genre candy, the self-revealing work of an auteur who has laid bare not so much his psyche as his online streaming queue. To watch this movie is, above all, to make a list of all the other movies it evokes, sometimes with a literalness that treads the boundary between homage and outright plagiarism.You will notice a lot of Martin Scorsese’s “Shutter Island” here, as a dogged young man (Dane DeHaan) makes his way through an asylum-like complex of buildings in search of answers, only to become ever more deeply ensnared in the place’s sinister mysteries. You may also catch echoes of Paolo Sorrentino’s “Youth” in the mountain rest-cure setting, the weary disdain for modern life and the visual voluptuousness. Mr. Verbinski doesn’t so much observe shiny surfaces and opulent furnishings as caress them, sending a frisson of visual delight through his camera as it glides down corridors and soars over wooded glades.There’s a bit of Guillermo del Toro’s “Crimson Peak” in the exuberant gothic creepiness, especially as the plot moves from corporate thriller to psychological melodrama to full-on creep show, complete with incest, medical experiments and ghoulish aristocratic shenanigans. And while these recent movies are the most obvious and distracting influences, an intrepid viewer will pick up hints of Hitchcock and Kubrick (and also, but only at the very end, of Spielberg), of “Suspiria” and Mario Bava.It’s all in good fun, really, though two and a half hours may be more of this kind of fun than a body can stand. You might feel like you’re in the company of a manic cinephile friend breathlessly recounting his favorite movie scenes in no particular order. You admire his devotion, his taste and his scholarship, but in the end the experience is probably more satisfying for him than it is for you.Still, the company isn’t bad. Mr. DeHaan brings an air of curdled innocence that inspires an interesting ambivalence. You sort of root for his character, a Wall Street hotshot named Lockhart, but you also kind of hope he suffers, since he’s a selfish, ill-mannered jerk. Dispatched by his bosses to retrieve an executive who has vanished in Switzerland, Lockhart, who is haunted by memories of his father’s suicide, finds himself in the company and eventually the care of Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaacs), a suave Continental with unnervingly impeccable manners. Mr. Isaacs is the kind of silken, charismatic villain that you can’t wait to see again.More plot summary would be an offense against Mr. Verbinski’s demented inventiveness. Lockhart also encounters a curious elderly patient (Celia Imre), a heavy-eyed limo driver (Ivo Nandi), a tavern full of hostile young locals and a dreamy girl named Hannah (Ms. Goth, looking like a ’70s fantasy hybrid of Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek). There are clues and false leads, shocking discoveries and bouts of talking-bad-guy exposition, narrow escapes and fights to the death. And those eels, of course. You’ll figure it all out for yourself, or not. In any case, the moral of the story turns out to be a bit of advice often given to travelers: Don’t drink the water.",0,8103139.0,8077739.0,0

It’s another entry in the tireless X-Men saga but doesn’t play like a retread or an ad for the next installment; instead, it plays, looks and sounds like a movie — an old-school meets new-school pulp filled with intimations of mortality, and raw, ugly violence. Once again, Hugh Jackman has saddled up to play the Wolverine, a mutant who also goes by Logan, and has always been the most satisfying character in the series. Mr. Jackman’s charm can lighten the glummest dirge, but for comic-book agnostics the real appeal is Logan’s reluctance to get involved, an ambivalence that can feel familiar to viewers exhausted by the same fight.This is the ninth time that Mr. Jackman has played Logan, and while the character’s claws are intact, the movie is a major narrative and stylistic shift in its franchise universe. It was directed by James Mangold, who shares script credit with Scott Frank and Michael Green, and has the clarity and directness of a classic genre picture. It’s part western, part neo-noir, the kind of movie in which a stranger steps from the shadows and shakes off his isolation and existential burden long enough to right whatever wrong needs righting. You know him: He’s the man with the tight smile and split lip, the one whose hard talk never fully obscures his wounded soul.The opener is kinetic, efficiently staged, casually sadistic and near-ritualistic in how it conforms to the genre playbook. Logan is napping in his parked car not far from the United States-Mexico border when he is awakened by a gang trying to steal his tires. It’s an archetypal poke-the-bear scene, the sort in which the hero announces his bona fides by eradicating villains too stupid to know what they are up against. Logan calls out to them, as if giving them fair warning. It’s pointless. Like most generic bad guys, these exist purely to wind the hero up — they’re the action-movie equivalent of foreplay — and soon Logan is slicing and dicing, spearing bodies like kebabs.Scenes like these turn characters into garbage that the hero has to bag up and toss. That’s standard genre posturing, but Logan is as much a hero as an outlier and can’t descend into nihilism. He needs a cause, a banner to hoist. So the movie complicates its bloodletting, including through a story line about corporate violence run amok in a near-lawless future. Enter the rogue geneticist (played with restrained flair by Richard E. Grant) with a venal aide-de-camp (a charismatic Boyd Holbrook) and an army of paramilitary cyborgs. These, in turn, connect to Laura (a terrific newcomer, Dafne Keen), a watchful, feral child who is fleeing across borders.Before long, Logan is playing the resistant head of a household that includes Laura as the ultimate in uncontrollable spawn and a sickly Professor X (Patrick Stewart) as their noble paterfamilias. Mr. Stewart, using a rasp that suggests decay is working its way out from the inside, does some beautiful work, especially with Mr. Jackman. Pushing and pulling at each other, they create a shared vulnerability that’s expressed both in physical degradations — the movie is filled with ravaged, traumatized bodies — and in the contrapuntal play between Logan’s gruff tenderness and Professor X’s floundering. (He’s Gramps by way of King Lear.)Much of “Logan” is an extended chase sequence, with Logan et al. forced on the run while pursued by the corporate concern. There are detours and kind strangers, open skies and endless miles, carnage and politics. En route, Mr. Mangold occasionally resorts to cliché, but many of his choices feel fresh, paradoxically because he has the heart of a classicist. He has watched his share of Clint Eastwood and old Hollywood, too. He’s also a sentimentalist, as his nod to the 1953 western “Shane” suggests. (“A gun is a tool,” that film’s gunslinger says, “as good or as bad as the man using it.”) The romance of the righteous kill remains a cinematic article of faith.“Logan” is a strong argument for bringing the comic-book movie down to earth. It solidly hits its marks as it moves the franchise furniture around, and features striking special-effects scenes in which the world shudders to a near standstill. Here, though, the pyrotechnics serve the story and are of a piece with a scaled-down realism that acknowledges — in its scars, viscera and flood of parentless children — the cost of the endless fight. It loves that fight, of course: That’s entertainment. But as it intimately tethers you to Logan and Laura, at times uncomfortably (their claws were made for impaling), it reminds you that these mutants are never less than human.",0,226276809.0,226258569.0,0

Jonas (Josh Wiggins, who made an effective screen debut in “Hellion” in 2014) is a 15-year-old high school dropout working on his parents’ struggling farm when he meets Casey (the Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse, from “The Book Thief”), who with her father has just moved in down the road.Casey’s dad, Wayne, an abusive alcoholic and corrupt sheriff (a bristling Bill Paxton, in one of his final film roles), has ties to drug runners. When Jonas overhears Wayne killing some of his criminal acquaintances, he plots an escape for Casey from her domestic hell. He steals a bag of drug money from Wayne, and soon the young couple, with dreams of finding freedom by the ocean, are hounded by the sheriff and his police accomplice (Colm Feore).Mr. Morlando — working with his skilled cinematographer, Steve Cosens, from a tight script by Kevin Coughlin and Ryan Grassby — capitalizes on rural Canadian locations in autumn and the chemistry of his young, talented stars. As the bravura composition of the group-murder sequence illustrates, Mr. Morlando knows how to stage a scene with tasteful understatement. Without stooping to titillation, he underscores the bond between Jonas and Casey, whose fate, though far from secure, leaves the viewer with hope and with cherished memories of their company.",0,,,0

(The script is by Mr. Sandler, in his feature debut, and one of the film’s producers, Thymaya Payne.) But the talented actors give their all. Nadine and Lewis, visiting a home owned by Nadine’s family, share intimate moments and minimal, frustratingly simple conversations seemingly intended to evoke an Antonioni film. Mr. Wisdom and Mr. Howze exude vivid conviction, with Mr. Howze’s character given rounded dimensions usually denied an antagonist. Mr. Dillon, however, struggles with the underwritten Myron.Absolutely breathtaking black-and-white neo-noir cinematography by Daniella Nowitz adds depth and emotional context. But it can’t fully flesh out the story, which reaches its climax with a storm and the discovery of a vessel of dead and dying emigrants. We are largely left with the images, which take us far, if not far enough.",0,,,0

Enveloped by the forest, the explorer and his crew face snakes, piranhas, insects and that most terrifying of threats: other people, who at times bombard the strangers with arrows. Undaunted, he perseveres, venturing more deeply into a world that first becomes a passion and then something of a private hallucination. It’s 1906, and while wonders like moving pictures are rapidly shrinking the world, the dream of unknown lands endures.That dream isn’t only about the Amazon in “The Lost City of Z” but also about the movies and their ability to transport us to astonishing new worlds. For us, the Age of Discovery is long gone and, for the most part, so are old-fashioned historical epics, other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly, but they’ve faded, casualties of shifting industry logic, audience taste, cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction, an easier, less contested playground for conquering white heroes.In “The Lost City of Z,” the writer-director James Gray has set out to make a film in the colonial era that suggests the likes of David Lean’s “Lawrence of Arabia,” but through a sensitive, contemporary lens. It’s one that starts from the premise that while white men have long been the keepers of the historical record, they didn’t make the past single-handedly. The story that Mr. Gray has chosen seems an unlikely candidate for such revisionism because it turns on Lieut. Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett, who came to believe in the existence of a lost Amazonian civilization. He called it the lost city of Z; others called it El Dorado, a European illusion that proved catastrophic for the New World.The movie opens shortly before Fawcett is approached by the Royal Geographical Society to map uncharted territory in Bolivia. A career soldier and son of a disgraced aristocrat, Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind, rather too easily, his loving wife, Nina (Sienna Miller, wonderful), and their young son (later played by Tom Holland), he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson, shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle, where each wonder is matched by terror, Fawcett is ravaged — and then transformed — by his discoveries of both a new world and another self.Mr. Gray opens this world gloriously. As a director, he has an old-fashioned belief in cinematic beauty, in the charm and necessity of the perfectly lighted and framed face, the hauntingly darkened room, the grittily coarsened street. He’s a sensualist, and in “The Lost City of Z” he turns the Amazon into a ravishment for the senses. (The cinematographer, Darius Khondji, who goes dark brilliantly, shot Mr. Gray’s last film, “The Immigrant.”) As Fawcett presses on, walking and sailing through dense shadow, streaming light and canopies of variegated green, the natural world comes fantastically alive with strange animal cries, stirring trees, roiling fog and frighteningly violent eddies.In time, native peoples emerge from those trees, by turns watchful, threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels, Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He’s a natural, somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam’s slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point, he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out “Amigo!” It’s a stratagem, but Fawcett’s curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world, which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home.Mr. Gray, working from David Grann’s 2009 book, “The Lost City of Z,” glosses over Fawcett’s more noxious beliefs. Mr. Grann, for one, writes that Fawcett “escaped virtually every kind of pathology in the jungle, but he could not rid himself of the pernicious disease of race.” It’s no surprise that the real Fawcett was as fascinatingly contradictory as you might expect of a Victorian-born British explorer. Mr. Gray doesn’t soften all of these uncomfortable edges — there is arrogance and tinges of cruelty in this portrait — but he’s far more interested in what seems to have distinguished Fawcett, namely his passionate belief that Amazonian Indians were not the primitives the West insisted they were.That passion sends Fawcett back to the Amazon several more times over the years, eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He’s hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip, but by the time he’s home he has a new child, whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life, as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family, a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story’s axis point. In most movies of this type, the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here, partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home, Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he’s willing to sacrifice.Fawcett finds ecstasy in and out of the Amazon, as does Mr. Gray, who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle, including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now, Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale, often with art films that play with genre. Here, he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There’s much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history.",1,8554554.0,8403655.0,0

(He has been seen, in small roles, in the likes of “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” and Adam Sandler’s “Jack and Jill,” neither exactly a star-making vehicle.) “How to Be a Latin Lover,” which bids to introduce him to a wider audience in the United States, is surprisingly deft in mixing Mr. Derbez’s broad but accomplished style with more ostensibly hip-absurdist Anglo modes of humor. Body-function jokes are, of course, a universal comedic language, and they’re here, too, although not as abundant as you might have expected.After an ostentatiously absurd and morbid origin story, in which two scrappy Mexican kids lose their dad in an explosive truck mishap, we then see one of those kids, Maximo, as a young man in his prime, seducing a considerably older grocery store heiress at a hotel pool. Twenty-five years later he and the woman are that much older, and Maximo, now played by a paunchy Mr. Derbez, is so thoroughly pampered that when he goes golfing, he putts while supine in his cart. But after she is seduced anew by an unctuous Lamborghini salesman, played by a very against-type Michael Cera, Maximo is out the door without a cent.“You signed a prenuptial agreement,” his soon-to-be-ex reminds him.“No I didn’t, I signed a prenup,” Maximo shoots back, and then pauses. “Oh …” he says, as it hits him.“How to Be a Latin Lover” is directed by the comic actor Ken Marino (known for his work on the TV show “The State” and in the likes of “Wet Hot American Summer,” here making his feature directorial debut) from a script by Chris Spain and Jon Zack. When it sticks to exchanges like the one above, it plays a little like a vintage Bob Hope picture with a dirty mind.Once Maximo settles in for some exposure to real life in the home of his estranged sister, Sara (Salma Hayek, very sweet when she’s not playing angry), and her son, Hugo, the balancing act of sentiment and asininity proves more difficult for the filmmakers. And, of course, the movie’s theme of gigolo-dom provides many opportunities for sexist, ageist and lookist humor, all of which “Latin Lover” takes with regularity. However, the whole enterprise is so fundamentally good-natured and fluffy that it’s sometimes hard to stay annoyed by it.Rob Lowe’s dryly dopey comedic presence as another gold digger is an asset. So is Raphael Alejandro as Hugo, who’s sweet and winsome and precocious without being cloying. For some reason, the actor John Heard shows up; he is seen crossing the street in a shot, never to return. It’s the only enigmatic feature of this goofball exercise.",0,32088029.0,32149404.0,0

Ms. Pappas — who, with Jeremy Teicher, also wrote, produced and directed — plays Plumb Marigold, an Olympic hopeful in Eugene, Ore., who discovers that there is life, and love, off the track.Plumb, who lives an insular existence with her father (Andy Buckley), is training with her best friend (Rebecca Friday) when she takes a shine to Sawyer (an affable, understated Chase Offerle), who works at a bakery on their route. After a doctor tells Plumb that she must rest for a day before competing in the Olympic trials — an option that’s anathema to her — she drops in on Sawyer, and soon is visiting his truck camper, weighing her attraction against the demands of her sport.“Tracktown” nails the athletic details: the raw eggs and specialized diet; the sensuality of toned bodies in exertion; the glitter of sports celebrity. And the attendant anxieties: “I look like a boy,” Plumb nervously tells Sawyer when he first beholds her taut abdomen. There is a subplot concerning Plumb’s estranged mother (Rachel Dratch, on point), but the film doesn’t stray far from romance.Ms. Pappas has little dialogue, but the camera adores her expressive, wide-eyed face, which conveys plenty. It will be interesting to see her evolve as an actress. As a writer, she has sound instincts: “Tracktown” is less about winning races and more about a greater victory, being true to yourself.",0,,,0

SCOTT,"Review: ‘Dead Men Tell No Tales.’ Not Very Well, Anyway.","This review will be short and dismissive. The movie under consideration — “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” — is, by contrasts, long and punishing. Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment. To insist otherwise is a variation on the sunk cost fallacy. Since you exchanged money for fun, fun is surely what you must have purchased, and you may cling to that idea in the face of contrary evidence. But trust me on this: This movie would be a rip-off even if someone paid you to see it.Because, to be honest, it’s barely a movie at all. The first installments of the “Pirates” franchise conquered skepticism with exuberance and charm. Somehow, a theme-park ride combined with clever, madcap visuals and Johnny Depp’s scapegrace showboating added up to something fresh. But that spirit is long gone. Mr. Depp, as Capt. Jack Sparrow, goes through the motions like a washed-up rock star reprising his greatest hits in a half-empty auditorium. The images are so dark and muddy that you can’t see what’s going on well enough to know why you don’t care. The plot twists, Easter eggs and surprises are either obvious or labored. You can’t spoil something that’s already thoroughly rotten.Now and then you get a reminder of why you might have enjoyed the earlier movies. There are a couple of nifty Rube Goldbergian action sequences — one with a bank vault, the other with a guillotine — that recall the berserk inventiveness of Gore Verbinski, the original director. But otherwise, “Dead Men Tell No Tales,” directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, is a tedious rehash.Two appealing young people (Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites) meet on a quest for a mysterious and powerful object. They are joined by Sparrow and pursued by old and new enemies: the British Navy; the greedy pirate Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush); and an army of ghouls led by the spectral Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), known as the butcher of the sea.This goes on for more than two hours. You are invited to sit through every last name on the lengthy end credits for a teasing extra scene of a couple asleep on linen sheets, a reminder of how you might have better spent the time. It would be a spoiler to identify those bedfellows, but the bigger spoiler is that apparently another sequel is on the way.",0,172537139.0,,0

Koontz, is nothing if not an exhaustive compendium of fright-film motifs. The story concerns Jack Zeller (Christopher Denham), a photographer with post-traumatic stress disorder who returns to his Midwestern hometown from a combat assignment in the Middle East, only to receive a camera whose pictures, when developed, depict murder victims within Jack’s compositions. Soon Jack is killing people himself — ostensibly to save others at risk (his motivation is murky) — and staging the crime scenes to resemble the images in the photos.His mental unraveling in “Camera Obscura” somewhat echoes those in many horror outings (including, for starters, “The Shining” and “Repulsion”). Other similarities to earlier movies abound, including a killer on grainy old videotape (à la “V/H/S/2”); spectral photographic phenomena (shades of “Shutter”); a soupçon of torture porn (as in the “Saw” and “Hostel” movies); dashes of morbid humor; and that hardy perennial the kitchen knife (but a special Tanaka knife). A flashback to Jack’s battle trauma adds a modicum of social commentary. Centipedes make cameo appearances, while intimations of child abuse and stalking are wholly gratuitous.Fortunately, “Camera Obscura” has decent actors to flesh out its dubious premise, not least Mr. Denham (“Billions”). As Jack’s fiancée, Nadja Bobyleva has an appealing range, and Catherine Curtin (soon to be in the second season of “Stranger Things”) ably portrays a skeptical police detective. But their diligent efforts cannot raise the whole enterprise above a mere exercise.",0,,,0

It’s a severe story, made more so by its powerhouse lead actress.This parable-like tale opens in mid-argument, as the determined title character (Dolores Fonzi) is informing her somewhat cynical father (Oscar Martínez) of her plan to leave her comfortable home in Argentina to teach in a rural village.“You say I’m an amazing lawyer,” she tells him. “What does that matter, if I can’t change anyone’s life?”Upon arriving in the poverty-stricken town she is confronted with unfriendly students and soon, much, much worse: One night she is beaten and raped. She believes that some of her pupils were involved, and the resulting suspicion and tension escalates: Her father arrives, seeking revenge, while Paulina fights to regain her bearings.Santiago Mitre, the director and one of the screenwriters (the film is based on a 1960 movie, “La Patota”), trains his camera on tight shots of Ms. Fonzi then stays out of her way. Though a few conversations mark her mind-set, there is no speechifying or grandstanding. Ms. Fonzi’s presence, arresting and often silent, speaks volumes.It’s frequently tough to decide if Paulina is misguided or admirable. Yet even if you disagree with the character’s choices, you can feel her belief in them, and respect her resolve. Indeed, few satisfying answers arise here. But there’s bravery in asking the questions, and this film knows something about courage.",0,,,1

SCOTT,Review: ‘The House’ Is a Comedy Built on Despair,"“The House,” a new comedy starring Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler, has arrived in theaters without advance screenings for critics. I know better than to take it personally when this kind of thing happens, but I do often wonder why it does happen. Usually the studio (Warner Bros. in this case) thinks it has a turkey on its hands, but sometimes it doesn’t know quite what it has, and sneaks an interesting movie into theaters more or less by mistake. That seems to have been the case this time.Based on trailers and the durable, slightly stale charm of its stars, “The House” might be mistaken for a genial, silly movie about nice people making questionable decisions. Instead, it is a dark, startlingly bloody journey into the bitter, empty, broken heart of the American middle class, a blend of farce and satire built on a foundation of social despair.It all starts innocently enough. Scott and Kate Johansen (Mr. Ferrell and Ms. Poehler) are visiting Bucknell University with their daughter, Alex (Ryan Simpkins). Mom and Dad are lovey, clingy, goofy Gen-X parents, and their kid is a high-achieving, deadpan millennial. Some borderline-inappropriate jokes are cracked and you brace yourself for 90 more minutes of semi-awkward, underwritten, marshmallow-soft humor featuring people who have been funnier elsewhere.But then Alex loses her scholarship and her parents face a not-all-that-exaggerated version of the struggle that confronts so many families. “It’s $50 million!” Scott exclaims when he sees the tuition bill. The poor math skills that seemed at first like an arbitrary character trait were more likely invented to enable that very joke. It might as well be $50 million. Suddenly this couple, with a big house in a pleasant, generic suburban town, find themselves in a state of abject desperation.So they team up with their pal Frank (Jason Mantzoukas) whose gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage and his self-esteem. He hopes to win back his estranged wife, Raina (Michaela Watkins) and persuades Scott and Kate to open an illegal casino in his half-empty mini-mansion. The business plan is straightforward: The house always wins.If “The House” had been made in the ’70s, it would have reveled in the grimness of the Johansens’ circumstances and exploited the moral tawdriness of their response to it. What is most unnerving about the way their story is presented here — Andrew Jay Cohen directed, and wrote the script with Brendan O’Brien — is the absence of that kind of dramatic intensity. Scott and Kate do some terrible things, and induce their friends and neighbors to misbehave in sometimes frightening ways. Scott mutilates someone with an ax. More than one person, actually. In addition to blackjack and roulette, the casino features an occasional fight club, in which upstanding folks pair off and beat each other bloody as their fellow burghers wager money on the outcome.The thing that will dismay some tenderhearted viewers — and that may have spooked the distributor — is the film’s steely refusal of hypocrisy. You wait for the moment of comeuppance or redemption, for the restoration of right and wrong, but no such moment arrives. The pop-culture references and musical cues that pepper the action are not as ironic as they may seem. Scenes from “The Walking Dead” and snatches of Snoop Dogg’s “Gz and Hustlas” and the “Sopranos” theme song provide clues about the reality that Kate and Scott are only partly aware they inhabit.The town’s political leadership (represented by Nick Kroll) is greedy and corrupt. Law enforcement (represented by Rob Huebel) is stupid and belligerent. The casino becomes not only a place of recreation but also the only place where civic interactions among the citizens seem possible. It also reveals the true face of a society divided into predators and prey, the house and the suckers.The only way to protect yourself and the people you love is to pick the right side. That seems shockingly cynical, but there is something admirable in a movie that examines some of the worst aspects of modern American life with blunt, good-humored honesty. We’re not nice people. You can bet on that.",0,25563273.0,25584504.0,1

Even seasoned defenders of cryptic formalism may find it amorphous. The characters are never named, the camera work is static, and little that’s conceptually interesting materializes.The film consists of loosely connected scenes with a general focus on adolescent girls swimming, cooking, getting sun and contemplating the independence of adulthood. “Kekszakallu” eventually fixates on an almost-protagonist (Laila Maltz), who seems uninterested in work and unsure of what to study, and who somehow manages to have a car accident in a mostly empty lot.From the ostensible Bartok source — wonderfully filmed by Michael Powell in the 1960s — Mr. Solnicki takes his title (Hungarian for “Bluebeard”), snatches of music and perhaps the germ of a theme of women heading off into an unknown future.At festivals, “Kekszakallu” won praise from critics, especially those who regard the blurring of fiction and documentary (Mr. Solnicki’s background) as inherently chic. Two accomplished minimalists, Matthew Porterfield (the director and co-writer of the underseen “I Used to Be Darker”) and Martín Rejtman, are associate producers, and Mr. Porterfield is credited as a narrative contributor. But “Kekszakallu” lacks the ballast of memorable images or scenes.",0,,,1

VERONGOS,Review: ‘The Last Dalai Lama?’ Asks What Comes Next,"A surplus of wisdom and benevolence radiates from “The Last Dalai Lama?,” written and directed by Mickey Lemle, the filmmaker of “Compassion in Exile” (1993), another documentary about this Buddhist leader, who is 82.“The Last Dalai Lama?” spends a lot of time looking back. A collection of moments rather than a linear story, this film is at its best when it’s suffused with the presence of the Dalai Lama, whether he is watching schoolchildren in Canada practice gratitude or meditating on separating his consciousness from his body in preparation for death.One fascinating segment introduces the Atlas of Emotions, commissioned by the Dalai Lama and developed by Paul and Eve Ekman, a father and daughter who used behavioral science to map human feelings and their consequences.Another shows Philip Glass at the organ at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York, playing music he composed for the Dalai Lama’s 1979 visit there and discussing how his own practice of Buddhism helped him as a composer.No film about this holy man would be complete without a recap of the escape from Tibet to Dharamsala, India, after the Chinese takeover of the country. The movie notes that the Chinese government has declared it will control the selection and development of the next Dalai Lama, an absurd idea to those who believe succession is a matter of reincarnation. The specter of two competing lamas, one controlled by the Chinese, also arises. In response, the ever-smiling Dalai Lama says he won’t reincarnate as a 15th Dalai Lama, but aides explain that statement doesn’t mean he won’t be reborn in exile, and the film is unlikely to settle the question definitively.",0,,145513.0,1

And also that he has seen, and admires, “Goodfellas,” which begins with a similar phrase.The speaker in “Trash Fire” is a young man named Owen, played by Adrian Grenier with maximum puppy-dog-eyed smirkiness. The film’s first half-hour depicts Owen as relentlessly abusive to the point of being repellent. But he does, as it happens, have genuine woes. Aw. This is in the grand tradition of certain American independent movies. A deeply flawed white male protagonist is revealed to have hidden depths; depths more than likely consonant with qualities the movie’s white male writer-director — in this case, Richard Bates Jr. — finds in himself.Hence, the writer-director is also invested in depicting everyone surrounding the protagonist as in some way worse. Even the relatively sensible long suffering girlfriend, Isabel (Angela Trimbur), has to endure gratuitous humiliation through Mr. Bates’s lens. Once Isabel tells Owen that she is pregnant, “Trash Fire” becomes something more than your standard-issue, faux transgressive, lose-lose character piece. Owen’s problems include seizures, accompanied by flashbacks that look like scenes from the low-budget direct-to-cable horror pictures of the early 1990s. The solution to the implied mysteries lies in Owen’s past, and a visit to his unstable aunt and damaged sister turn the failed black comedy into a failed American Guignol. I didn’t think I had see a worse fiction film this year than that other failed American Guignol, “Clown.” I may have been wrong.GLENN KENNY“Trash Fire” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language, sexuality, horror violence and the usual.",0,,,0

In any event, I thought about two-thirds of  “Kevin Hart: What Now?” was pretty-to-very funny, and one third meh.The movie, directed by Leslie Small and Tim Story, takes its title from his 2015 tour, and the question comes as a result of Mr. Hart’s having scaled certain heights of comedic and financial success. He opens his set by complaining about a threatening raccoon prowling around his secluded and no doubt ritzy new digs. His brash, energetic style deliberately masks a more timid (sometimes even cowardly) persona; his admissions of vulnerability generate the biggest laughs. (There’s actually a touch of Bob Hope in his work; both get a lot of mileage out of working a craven persona.) The verbal leitmotifs he establishes early on circle back into his anecdotes in surprising and satisfying ways. And his bit about his father using an iPhone is the only genuinely funny comedy about older people and technology that I’ve ever heard. There are frequent cut-aways to a diverse-looking audience eating it all up.The movie is a good representation of Mr. Hart’s comedy, but not a perfect one; it’s bracketed by a goofy and lightweight (albeit star-studded) James Bond parody. If I were asked to offer one answer to the question posed by the movie’s title, I’d advise Mr. Hart to steer clear of such gratuitous indulgences in the future. But I don’t think I’m the person he’s asking.GLENN KENNY“Kevin Hart: What Now?” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for (surprise!) raunchy language.",1,23564630.0,23574605.0,0

If that sounds like faint praise, well, it is and it isn’t. There’s always something to be said for an entertainment that sustains its nuttiness all the way to its twisty finish. This one may not make much sense, but — like a demented old film noir or a Shonda Rhimes show at its crazed best — “Girl” doesn’t falter in its absurdity or commitment to its own seriousness. It never winks. You may laugh (as the audience I saw it with did, on and off), but there’s genuine pleasure in that mirth.It’s based on the 2015 book by the British author Paula Hawkins that vaulted to the top of the best-seller list with a mix of unreliable narration, suspicious characters, ugly emotions, freewheeling gender stereotypes and a slowly kinking mystery that becomes as perilous as the labyrinth at the Overlook Hotel. With a troika of dubious female narrators, the book isn’t an obvious choice for the big screen, partly because of its rotating first-person voices. One problem is how to get into those separate heads, which the director Tate Taylor has tried to solve with voice-overs and by piling on close-ups, creating a proximity approaching the dermatological.Its loomingest head belongs to the hard-working Emily Blunt, who plays Rachel, the story’s hub. She was once married to Tom (Justin Theroux, trying out his smile), who’s now married to Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), with whom he has a baby. A hard drinker, Rachel chugs booze like water and weeps like a broken faucet. She’s a sloshy mess, or so we’re meant to believe from her alternating lightly or heavily smeared eyeliner, which functions as a kind of mood ring-Breathalyzer. She’s a masochist: She stares out of a commuter-train window at the house where she lived with Tom, and where he now lives with Anna and their child. Rachel is also a fantasist: She ogles another couple, dreaming about their lives.Put another way, Rachel is a stand-in for us, the viewer, the voyeur who peers into other lives. Specifically, she’s a proxy for the consumer of a certain kind of glorious romantic fiction, in which beautiful women suffer magnificently. Hollywood used to excel at these kinds of stories, movies in which, say, Bette Davis or Ingrid Bergman suffered, endured and suffered some more before their teary, square-jawed, set-shouldered triumph. Those types of movies aren’t all that common in American cinema these days, partly because women and their stories aren’t. The sobs and drama nonetheless did keep flowing, first in daytime soap operas and later in nighttime soaps.Rachel is a clever surrogate, especially because she doesn’t really appear that far gone. She may drink way too much, but, well, she looks like the lovely, spunky and very appealing Ms. Blunt, just with chapped lips, splotchy skin and raccoon eyes. Like almost every star in a mainstream vehicle who plays a problematic character, Ms. Blunt — her persona, filmography, likability, relatability — serves as a kind of assurance from the filmmakers to the viewers not to worry, that things will turn out all right. Her stardom is our light at the end of the dark tunnel, a flickering promise, which is one thing that hasn’t changed much since the days of old-studio female martyrdom.You need a tough woman for that sort of job, and Ms. Blunt, who moves easily out of crinolines and into combat gear, holds this material together with fierce, unwavering conviction. Rachel’s fantasy duo turn out to be Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott (Luke Evans), a married couple who tend to pose or rut whenever Rachel’s train conveniently passes by. Megan also likes to stand on her balcony, playing peekaboo with her robe and flashing her undies and tummy. Or at least that’s how Rachel sees Megan. That’s also how we see Megan, an outlook that’s meant to change as the points of view shift, diverge and unite. As always, much depends on who’s telling the story.Mr. Taylor doesn’t so much juggle the movie’s various parts — including a fragmented timeline, a device that here is nothing but empty mannerism — as lob them at the screen. (Erin Cressida Wilson wrote the script.) When Megan disappears, Rachel turns detective, if one mildly hindered by her drinking and narratively convenient habit of blacking out, which means that she doesn’t always know what’s happened in her own life. Rachel goes through a crucible of agony, braving abuse, infertility, betrayal and ravages of the body and the mind. But she looks. And she learns, including about other women. That’s the moral of this story, the appealing, gleaming jewel in the trash.“The Girl on the Train” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for extremely bad adult behavior.

But Shrihari Sathe’s “1000 Rupee Note,” true to its origins in the Maharashtra State of India, is told in a dialect of that language.In this light tale, Budhi (Usha Naik), a widow in a rural hamlet, has lost her son, a farmer, to suicide because he could not repay a moneylender, a very real problem in the region in recent years.She cherishes each match and drop of oil in her one-room hovel, yet she always shares, giving part of her meager meal of bread to a dog and even a few crumbs to a colony of red ants. A year after her son’s death, she smiles as she passes through the village buying necessities. To support herself, she cleans the home of a wealthy family.Her best friend is the young man next door, Sudama (Sandeep Pathak), a goatherd who shares tea with her. He is the one Budhi chooses to accompany her on a shopping expedition to a nearby town after she comes by a few 1,000-rupee notes at a political rally.And that is where the singularly third world misadventures begin, for what merchant can break such a large bill, especially at the beginning of the business day? And what unsavory police official can resist someone from the countryside carrying a handful of bills?A parable about the contagious nature of corruption and the curse of dirty money, “1000 Rupee Note” asks, How valuable is a windfall to people who live their lives largely without money?Its conclusion, harrowing, humorous and arguably unfortunate, only reinforces the idea that the unsophisticated country people are better off as they were.",0,,,0

It’s both the best children’s animated film this year since “Inside Out” — you might call it “Outside In” — and, unexpectedly, a more stirring depiction of the deadening modern megalopolis than most heal-the-world documentaries.The curious, nameless boy — his face is like a shirt button — is at first our portal to the unfiltered beauty of the fields and jungles of rural Brazil. Mr. Abreu’s bouquets of crayon color and jazzy sound design explode on the screen, treated as an arena to roam left and right, up and down. Then the tyke’s journey plunges into the depths of reality when he hops a train, joining the spindly migrants heading to the city in search of work.What follows is a jaw-dropping sketch of towering cities and mechanized factories that brings in dark wit and satire (and clever collage) without abandoning the child’s wonder. Mr. Abreu and his film’s music makers further set up a rousing duel of leitmotifs: the cacophony of the brown-gray city, apparently in the throes of a fascist takeover, versus a recurring parade of folk music accompanied by a florid phoenix.Not the most subtle critique, but this is a children’s film, after all, and it acquires a primal purity by avoiding intelligible dialogue. (The few spoken lines seem to be played in reverse.) It’s like some lost globally conscious colorfest from the 1970s, reinvented with Mr. Abreu’s verve.“Boy and the World” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some grim thematic material and images.",1,,,1

Patrick Sean O’Brien’s “TransFatty Lives,” in which he records his own deterioration from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, seems determined not to be pigeonholed in that fashion. That makes it refreshingly unpredictable but also frustrating.Mr. O’Brien was a devil-may-care fellow, a D.J. known as TransFatty who dabbled in video-making when, in 2005, at age 30, he received a diagnosis of A.L.S., also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. He started filming his struggles with the disease, which soon left him in a wheelchair with little ability to move.The film meanders quite a bit, sometimes seeming as if it wants to raise awareness of the disease, sometimes documenting the strain it puts on caregivers. (Giving Mr. O’Brien, who is not svelte, a bath takes several strong helpers.) But at its core is an unexpected addition to Mr. O’Brien’s life that comes more than two years into his illness (this review will leave the nature of it unspoiled), and then just as rapidly disappears from it, without much explanation. There was an opportunity to explore in more depth the phenomenon of abandonment that many with debilitating diseases speak of — the people they thought would be there for the long haul fall away — but Mr. O’Brien doesn’t take it.“TransFatty Lives” is not rated.

Without seeing the earlier movie, I can’t comment; but after enduring this one, I can only wonder why the brothers would cop to any creative input at all.Shatteringly stupid and repulsively misogynistic, “Martyrs” mashes revenge, torture and the supernatural into one solid, quasi-religious lump. Flailing at its center are two young women, Lucie (Troian Bellisario) and Anna (Bailey Noble), who bonded in an orphanage 10 years earlier after Lucie escaped from a mysterious tormentor. Plagued by monstrous visions and furniture that skittered across her bedroom floor, Lucie was in dire need of an understanding bestie.As adults, however, the demands on that friendship are so brutal and preposterous that Anna’s devotion is never remotely believable. Saddled with a screenplay (by Mark L. Smith) that prioritizes slaughter over sisterhood, the actresses scream and groan in contorted close-up as they morph from victims to killers and back again. Their actions — which involve bloody payback on Lucie’s former captors and the uncovering of a looney-tunes cult — are frequently so nonsensical that their many and varied torments become the movie’s de facto point.Observed with gloating precision by Sean Odea’s dispassionate camera, the flaying and knifing, drilling and gagging are depressingly pointless. The cult wants to know what we see at the moment of death. I’m not certain, but I might have just seen it.",0,,,0

Battling the undead keeps her, friends and family safe from the flesh-eating hordes, but the character has been so radically transformed from Austen’s that Elizabeth already feels like a goner.The movie is adapted from the 2009 novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, who hit commercial pay dirt with a catchy title and the fusion of two ludicrously opposed, nominally irreconcilable cultural touchstones: Austen and zombies. With tongue in cheek and a copy of Austen’s novel of manners apparently by his side, Mr. Grahame-Smith added a zombie apocalypse to the Bennet family concerns, peppering the chatter about balls, romantic prospects and the uncertain future of its five unmarried daughters with asides about human brains scooped out like “pumpkin seeds from a jack o’ lantern.” Mr. Darcy is as proud and disagreeable as ever, but like Elizabeth, he’s also a warrior.In Austen’s novel, the mutually hostile Elizabeth and Darcy are already combatants of a kind whose primary weapons are their witty, wounding, deeply meaningful words. In the movie, Elizabeth and Darcy (Sam Riley, a persuasively brooding presence), sling metaphoric arrows at each other now and again, but they’re so busy fighting the zombies overrunning the country that their actions invariably drown out everything else. Both pride and prejudice still play their parts, but now in service to one tediously repeated joke: the sight of a gentleman or a lady, together or alone, playing cards or ballroom dancing, fatally swarmed by devouring zombies.The writer-director Burr Steers came prepared for battle, if not much else, with appealing actors — Charles Dance, Jack Huston and an amusing Lena Headey — as well as handsome drawing rooms and impressive estates. But as one zombie brain after another is pulverized, and as Elizabeth and her crew slip through another close call, the story’s lone joke and its grinding literalness grow dull. It doesn’t help that Mr. Steers, as his occasional leering peeks up Elizabeth’s skirts underscore, clings to some old-fashioned ideas about women and their on-screen uses. The larger problem, though, is that each moment spent on this movie is another spent away from Austen’s novel.“Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Directed by John Hillcoat, it purrs to a start with men plotting in near dark, a hook-y start that establishes the look and mood. Within minutes, the men are robbing an Atlanta bank in a scene filled with gunfire and rattling, visceral specifics, like the wet stains spreading under the weeping, prostrate employees. The men’s camaraderie and choreography announce their professionalism while the guns and money telegraph the stakes. And all of this is gone with the wind the moment Kate Winslet swaggers in, wearing a doo-wop bouffant and flashing a blingy Star of David as big as a bagel.It’s unclear what Ms. Winslet is doing in this movie, even if she routinely likes to ditch the refined English rose thing for something down-market and a little rough. Here she plays Irina Vlaslov, a Russian-Israeli hausfrau and mob wife who, in between rolling out what looks like rugelach dough and getting her hair set and shellacked, runs the business while her husband does time. She’s a ridiculous, flamboyant conceit and would be easy to write off if her depravity were not so yoked to her Jewishness. But Irina is a particularly ugly, scheming spider woman who spins her web while running her yarmulke-wearing thugs, ominously cooing at her young nephew (Blake McLennan) and forcing his desperate father, Michael (Chiwetel Ejiofor), to do very bad things.Those bad things prove to be fire and fuel for “Triple 9,” one of those productions in which much of the creative energy has been funneled into gaudily inventive displays of violence. Except for the Jewish mob, everything else conforms to genre type: the doomed prostitute, the talk of one last job, etc. It’s a disappointing waste of an appealing cast that includes Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, Clifton Collins Jr., Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer, Michael K. Williams and that reliable M.V.P. Woody Harrelson. One of the few other female speaking parts belongs to the Israeli actress Gal Gadot, whose big moment involves guiding Michael, suddenly as helpless as a Samson with a crew cut, to bed. Presumably Ms. Gadot will have more to do when she plays Wonder Woman in some forthcoming superhero movies.Other than Irina, the only characters with anything to do are men; they’re decent or corrupt cops (sometimes both), others are former Special Forces. (It’s a drag that the faces of the darker-skinned actors sometimes melt into the shadows that Mr. Hillcoat likes so much.) They’re backed by a phalanx of supporting players who provide some atmosphere by throwing gang signs, glowering at the police and running and gunning in a battlefield that could as easily be Los Angeles or Mexico City. An image of a child and a violent video game suggests that the filmmakers (the script is by Matt Cook) mean to draw lines between onscreen and offscreen violence, but that moment quickly passes, leaving no trace.Mr. Hillcoat wears his nihilism easily and persuasively (his films include “The Road”), so his weird bids at mordant comedy feel as forced as they are ill-considered, whether he’s connecting a sign for “Kosher meats” with bloodied victims or dropping a flip reference to “La Kosher Nostra.” These jokes are especially sour given that the only decent man in the story has a cross hanging from his neck and another on a wall. It’s baffling what Mr. Hillcoat thinks he’s doing with this imagery. He has a gift for casting talent and for conveying the intimacy of a shared endeavor, whether the focus is on two men or an entire SWAT team. That he also has an eye for detail remains as evident as it was in his last feature, “Lawless,” a disappointment which was released by the Weinstein Company.“Triple 9” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for gunplay and bloodletting.

Given the production budget, the pitch was obviously good enough for someone to write a check and hire an action director, Louis Leterrier, who could give the material the requisite spit-shine: After years of separation, two drastically different brothers — a sleek superspy and a bumbling fool — reunite and, in between guffaws, heal old wounds, zip around the world and fight a global crime syndicate.So, you know, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby reloaded, except that now it’s Mr. Cohen and Mark Strong swimming both in fountains of fluids and an elephant vagina that proves as bustling as Grand Central Terminal at rush hour. If that sounds gross, it is; more important, it isn’t funny, starting with the premise. As a comedian, Mr. Cohen revels in extremes. At his best, he can push an outrageous conceit right up to its limits (and yours). He’s especially adept at finding that sweet, destabilizing spot where an audience’s comfortable laughter turns suddenly, confusingly, queasy. But while there may be comedy gold in an elephant’s vagina, Mr. Cohen fails to find it here.The problem is partly rhythmic. Like too many of the more elaborate comic bits in “Grimsby,” the elephant sketch soon drags and dies, its foundational visual gag (Jonah in pachyderm privates) never reaching gagging hilarity. Mr. Cohen just seems off his game in “Grimsby,” and it may be that the movie’s high concept proved too constricting for someone who has done some of his best work (as in the “Borat” film) with a looser, more episodic format. He seems boxed in, rather than liberated by, the spy movie, which of course is already self-parodying, as illustrated in the opener of “Grimsby,” which crams an entire franchise of action-movie clichés under the credits.Mostly, Mr. Cohen is done in by his character, Nobby, a mutton-chopped caricature of vulgarity whose unreconstructed stupidity and deep-veined sentimentality suggest that he may have other relatives tearing it up in Mike Leigh’s class-conscious comedies. Mr. Cohen remains committed to his inner adolescent, but he has latched onto a potentially sharp political idea in “Grimsby”: that the British poor are every bit as tough, ingenious, spirited and finally murderous as an agent in Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Mr. Cohen has a gift for plumbing the depths of ignorance, and other people’s rank stupidity has been both his target and weapon. In Nobby, he instead finds a hero, and defeat.“The Brothers Grimsby” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for gun violence and assaulted genitals.

About 10 years Mr. Tsai’s junior, Mr. Lee appears in nearly every film Mr. Tsai has made; many of these, including “Goodbye, Dragon Inn” and “What Time Is It There?,” are masterpieces of contemporary Asian cinema.The setup for “Afternoon” may sound familiar to experts in cinematic minimalism; nonetheless, the film has a distinct feel. A single camera, tilted down from a relatively tall position, takes in a corner of an unfinished room in a house. Two windows, one on each wall, show the house is situated someplace high; a mountain covered in lush vegetation is visible through the left window opening, and vines are straggling into the right. Mr. Tsai and Mr. Lee, seated on leather chairs, face each other and chat. Mr. Tsai is chattier; Mr. Lee hardly opens his mouth for the first 20 minutes. Mr. Tsai’s volubility barely masks a greater vulnerability, and the conversation, which encompasses family, sexuality and art-making, has an elliptical quality that finally asks, with some anguish, if the duo’s collaboration is finished, or will continue.And that’s it. Obviously, this is not a film for viewers unfamiliar with Mr. Tsai’s work. But its insistently austere format does suggest a purpose beyond its immediate context. The leaves that rustle outside as the men talk, and when they pause, bring to mind a fragment of Ezra Pound’s “The Cantos”: “I have tried to write Paradise/Do not move/Let the wind speak/That is paradise.”",1,,,0

She’s a flight attendant; he’s a German living in Chile and involved with supporters of President Salvador Allende. It’s 1973, and she’s enjoying a glossy stopover with him when the Pinochet coup that overthrows President Allende sweeps them both up.Daniel is tossed into the real-life compound known as Colonia Dignidad, a cult presided over by a man named Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist), and in an effort to rescue him, Lena pretends to be a willing convert, joining Schäfer’s glassy-eyed followers.Capturing a cult leader’s hypnotic power is difficult for an actor, and Mr. Nyqvist doesn’t put across the allure of Schäfer, who died in 2010. And the film doesn’t really put across the horrors of Colonia, seeming more interested in telling a tidy heroine-saves-her-man story. It’s a historical exposé reduced to TV movie simplicity.

Here’s the short version: Since the country gained independence in 1980, it’s been ruled by the autocrat Robert Mugabe. In 2008, compelled by international scrutiny over what many saw as a sham election, Mr. Mugabe was forced to share power with his rival, Morgan Tsvangirai. That situation led to the formation of a committee to draft a constitution that would push the country’s government closer to a Western-style democracy.Ms. Nielsson and her crew had exceptional access to the two men steering the constitutional process: Paul Mangwana, representing ZANU-PF, Mr. Mugabe’s party; and Douglas Mwonzora, a representative of the Movement for Democratic Change (M.D.C.). Both men are lawyers, and they each make a great show of being happy warriors, as it were, and approach each other with often deferential friendliness. But an indication of how big a struggle one side faces comes early on. At an outreach session held in a rural province, an unusually large number of citizens proclaim that only the president ought to be permitted to appoint judges.What is happening here? Are the Zimbabweans of the old school, veterans of the war that won their country its independence, so flush with nationalist pride that they revere Mr. Mugabe so? Or is the whole process being rigged by Mr. Mugabe’s secret service? Ms. Nielsson’s handling of the events silently stresses that there are no simple answers to those questions.The fits and starts of the process put the opposing representatives, both charismatic fellows, through some fascinating changes. Mr. Mwonzora winds up in jail during a particularly crucial point of constitutional drafting, while Mr. Mangwana haplessly finds himself in that dangerous position of being termed a “sellout” later on. Ms. Nielsson’s cameras take us only so far behind the scenes; Mr. Mugabe’s own conference rooms are never entered. But the portrait of passionate people struggling to improve their government is urgent, vivid and satisfactory. Both inspiring and upsetting, “Democrats” is, finally, a film that deserves to be called “necessary.”“Democrats” is not rated. It is in English and Shona, with English subtitles.

81,2016-04-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:24,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Review: Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s Intense World and His Films,"“I’d like to be for cinema what William Shakespeare was for theater, Marx for politics, and Freud for psychology,” the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder is quoted as having said in the Danish director Christian Braad Thomsen’s documentary study, “Fassbinder: To Love Without Demands.”Fassbinder, who died in 1982 at 37, was an extreme workhorse whose stupendous output — more than 60 films and two television series, not to mention plays — was accomplished with little sleep and an indifference to his physical well-being. Copious drugs and alcohol were consumed to keep up the pace. Mr. Thomsen, who directed this reverent tribute, met Fassbinder in 1969 at the Berlin International Film Festival, where his early movie “Love Is Colder Than Death” was booed. Fassbinder, unruffled, dismissed the Berlin critics as “provincials” and remarked, “At least they reacted.” Over the coming years, Mr. Thomsen interviewed the director and became a close friend.The access to Fassbinder that the relationship provided was a boon to the film, but a disadvantage as well because the close-up view results in a patchy portrait rather than a coherent biography. The documentary assumes a familiarity with Fassbinder’s movies that few American viewers possess. There is no film-by-film analysis of his major works, which include “The Marriage of Maria Braun” and “Berlin Alexanderplatz,” or the connection from one to the next.What is emphasized is Fassbinder’s obsession with family. The film examines him through a Freudian lens, paying special attention to his mother, Lilo Pempeit, who appeared in many of his films and whose voice is heard in audio interviews. After World War II, Fassbinder was brought up in Munich by an ever-changing group of adults who lived in a house in which he enjoyed almost unlimited freedom. As his career developed, his filmmaking colleagues and troupe of actors became a surrogate family.The film is divided into chapters — with titles like “Childhood,” “The Actors,” “Sadomasochism” and “Death” — that create a semblance of structure. Fassbinder had ambivalent feelings about Hollywood and abhorred sentimentality. Of the many directors Fassbinder admired, Mr. Thomsen says, the closest thing to an idol was Douglas Sirk (born Klaus Detlef Sierck in Hamburg) who used Hollywood conventions only to subvert them in movies like “Imitation of Life,” a film with soap-opera theatrics that disguised an underlying social critique.Fassbinder’s changing politics are mentioned, but in bits and pieces, with little effort made to tie everything into a consistent theory. Among the actors interviewed, the most time is given to Irm Hermann, who describes Fassbinder’s abusive, authoritarian control over her. Other actors featured in Fassbinder films, especially Hanna Schygulla, are seen in clips, but are not interviewed.In the chapter “Sadomasochism,” any details of sexual tastes are missing, as are references to his lovers, most of them male, although the movie notes that three of them committed suicide. In Fassbinder’s last five years, the documentary says, he lost his trust in the idea of community and decided that the world was crazy and could not be changed except into “a kind of personal madness.”This frustrating if intriguing film suggests that Fassbinder did the same, but indirectly. He died of overwork. There is a tumultuous story left untold.“Fassbinder: To Love Without Demands” is not rated. It is in English and German, with English subtitles.

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘O.J.: Made in America,’ an Unflinching Take on His Rise and Fall","Back in 1995, “trial of the century” may have seemed a little over the top, even as the television-watching public was transfixed by gavel-to-gavel coverage, and hitherto obscure Los Angeles lawyers became household names. More than 20 years later, though, it sounds like an understatement. The trial of O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman touched every exposed nerve in the American body politic and forced Americans to confront matters we often prefer to cloak in euphemism and denial: racial division, domestic violence, the hyperactivity of the news media and the toxicity of celebrity culture.None of that has gone away. If anything, the contradictions exposed by the trial have been heightened. But for a long time, the killings, and Mr. Simpson’s acquittal, lingered in a familiar kind of semi-oblivion, a bizarre, horrible episode we might remember but didn’t really want to think about. For people too young to have watched the proceedings in Judge Lance A. Ito’s courtroom unfold in real time, the story had a fuzzy, almost folkloric quality. A great football player might have stabbed two people to death. A jury decided otherwise. Kardashians were somehow involved. Weird.But this year, either by coincidence or by through the inscrutable workings of the spirit of the times, the story is being retold not once, but twice, both times with impressive clarity and seriousness. “The People v. O. J. Simpson,” Ryan Murphy’s extraordinary installment in the “American Crime Story” anthology on FX, which had its premiere in February, focused on the trial itself and on the constellation of characters brought together by the defendant. Mr. Simpson himself, though capably played by Cuba Gooding Jr., was a bit of a cipher, less the protagonist of the drama than its structuring absence. The series was pretty sure about what he did, but it never quite figured out who he was.[See where to stream “O.J.: Made in America” at Watching, The New York Times’s film and TV recommendation site.]“O.J.: Made in America,” a staggering five-part, nearly eight-hour installment in ESPN’s ambitious and innovative “30 for 30” documentary series, which is also being released in an extended format in theaters, goes a long way toward filling in that blank. Though dominated by the trial, it extends the narrative in both directions, producing a detailed biography of Mr. Simpson that is also a social history of race, fame, sports and Los Angeles over the past half-century. “The People v. O. J. Simpson” was a tightly packed, almost indecently entertaining piece of pop realism, a Dreiser novel infused with the spirit of Tom Wolfe. For its part, “O.J.: Made in America,” directed by Ezra Edelman, has the grandeur and authority of the best long-form nonfiction. If it were a book, it could sit on the shelf alongside “The Executioner’s Song” by Norman Mailer and the great biographical works of Robert Caro.It’s very much a film, though, a feat of tireless research, dogged interviewing and skillful editing. Some of the images have an uncanny familiarity, while others land with almost revelatory force. It was a little unnerving to watch courtroom scenes re-enacted by the cast of the FX mini-series, and the strangeness is redoubled by the return of the originals as they were then and as they are now.Not everyone involved with the case participated in the documentary — the absence of Christopher Darden is especially keenly felt — and some important figures (notably Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Robert Kardashian) are no longer alive. But Mr. Edelman has nonetheless assembled an impressively broad and deep roster of interviewees. Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman from the prosecution side, along with Gil Garcetti, at the time the Los Angeles district attorney. Carl Douglas, F. Lee Bailey and Barry Scheck from Mr. Simpson’s defense team. Members of the Los Angeles Police Department (including the notorious Mark Fuhrman) are on hand, as are African-American activists and clergymen from Los Angeles.Their words are variously reflective and blunt, candid and self-serving, but the film’s purpose is less to relitigate past events than to make sense of them. The shadow of Rodney King — his videotaped beating by L.A.P.D. officers, their acquittal and the subsequent riots — hangs over the Simpson trial, but so does a much longer history of racism and brutality. The jury’s verdict, which struck many white observers at the time as inexplicable, is situated against a background of longstanding resentment and mistrust that the prosecution misjudged and the defense successfully exploited.“O.J.: Made in America” goes back to the 1960s, bringing in the voices of journalists, writers and ordinary residents of Los Angeles, who relate a sorry chronicle of discrimination and abuse. This narrative is entwined with the more upbeat tale of Mr. Simpson’s earlier life. Viewers are reminded that he was an amazing football player, one of the most brilliant running backs ever to play the game. The first chapter of the documentary follows his rise from the Potrero Hill housing project in San Francisco to the campus of the University of Southern California, and then to a professional career with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers.Mr. Simpson’s talent was considerable, and it seems to have been exceeded by his charm. Friends and teammates testify to his generosity, his charisma and his shrewd ability to foster and profit from his image as an all-around good sport. He was one of the first black athletes to succeed nationally in advertising, most notably as the face of Hertz, running through airports to cries of “Go, O.J., Go!” He also distanced himself from the racial politics of the 1960s and ’70s, in striking and deliberate contrast to athletes like Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell and Jim Brown. “I’m not black. I’m O.J.,” he liked to say. The sportswriter Robert Lipsyte describes Mr. Simpson as a “counterrevolutionary,” and in Brentwood he assimilated easily into the white elite.But this is a character study as much as a sociological inquiry, and Mr. Edelman brings to light intriguing facts about Mr. Simpson without leaning too hard on their possible significance. He cheated at golf. His father was gay. He was loyal to his teammates and unfaithful to his wife.Inevitably, there are gaps in the record and holes in the interpretive framework the film constructs around it. It is hard not to notice the predominance of male voices among the interview subjects, and the narrowness of the film’s discussion of domestic violence. This is not to say that the issue is ignored: Mr. Simpson’s history of abusing Nicole is extensively and graphically documented, as is the fact that most of his friends ignored what was going on at their Rockingham estate. But the film, which so persuasively treats law enforcement racism as a systemic problem, can’t figure out how to treat violence against women with the same kind of rigor or nuance.As a black man caught up in the criminal justice system — and, for that matter, as a famous man exposed to the glare of nonstop media attention — O. J. Simpson is viewed as a symbol. His unique experience is a lens onto something larger, and his fate carries political significance. Nicole Brown Simpson’s fate, in contrast, is treated as an individual tragedy, and there seems to be no political vocabulary available to the filmmakers to understand what happened to her. The deep links between misogyny and American sports culture remain unexamined.This is a significant blind spot, but I want to emphasize that “O.J.: Made in America” sees a great deal very clearly and does not flinch from what it sees. The last episode, which shows what happened to Mr. Simpson after the verdict, is in a way the most wrenching and upsetting part of the film. The trial, as tawdry and tabloidesque as it often was, had a certain gravity, a moral seriousness that to some extent justified and mitigated the spectacle. The subsequent chapter, which ends in the Nevada prison where Mr. Simpson currently resides, is all entropy, squalor and sleaze. Having traced every step of his journey in detail over eight hours, you still find yourself wondering what the hell happened to this guy. He was made in America, and unmade here, too.“O.J.: Made in America” is not rated. Running time: nearly 8 hours.",1,,,0

But if the sound failed, that would be a tragedy. While this documentary, subtitled “Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble,” is lovely to watch, it’s even more beautiful to hear.“I’m always trying to figure out, at some level, who I am and how I fit in the world, which I think is something that I share with seven billion other people,” Mr. Ma says early in the film. That curiosity led him to assemble the Silk Road Ensemble, a collective of some 50 musicians and other artists from across the globe. “This was like the Manhattan Project of music,” one interviewee says of the group, which was founded in 2000.Morgan Neville, the documentary’s director, follows the ensemble as it performs, and profiles a few of its members — among them Kayhan Kalhor, a kamancheh player from Iran, and Kinan Azmeh, a clarinetist from Syria — who speak about the threatened traditions of their homelands.There are discussions of the relevance of music in a violent world, and of the stress of staying true to one’s art while mixing with other styles. It’s both thoughtful and lively, and a nice companion to last year’s “Song of Lahore,” another documentary that looks at the melding of musical cultures.As in his Oscar-winning film, “20 Feet From Stardom,” Mr. Neville knows how to capture the magic of performance and how to encourage professionals to speak plainly. To be sure, this loosely structured story needs a stronger outline; you’ll often wish for clarifying details on the group’s programming and its unfamiliar instruments. But then the music will play, and you’ll think this film wants for nothing.",0,,,0

SCOTT,"Review: ‘Wiener-Dog,’ the Tail That Wags Through a Few Bitter Lives","Some filmmakers range across genres and styles, reinventing themselves from one project to the next. Todd Solondz is the other kind. At this point in their careers, we don’t expect documentary-style naturalism from Wes Anderson, bittersweet romance from Quentin Tarantino or violent action from Whit Stillman. And we don’t turn to Mr. Solondz for warm affirmations of human decency.Across eight features in 27 years, the awfulness of our species — in particular its North American, suburban varieties — has served Mr. Solondz as both premise and punch line. You can take his misanthropy or leave it. You can also vacillate (as I have preferred to do) according to the swings of your own mood or the particulars of story and performance, but the axioms of his universe are remarkably consistent. Selfishness trumps empathy. Intimacy is the surest route to humiliation. Ambition is the handmaiden of failure. Cruelty is pervasive, innocence is toxic, and the most likable people are the ones who are most honest in their hatefulness.“Wiener-Dog” dramatizes these assumptions in the inscrutable presence of a nonhuman observer, a dachshund who goes by a few different names and endures the company of a variety of masters. A New Jersey couple (Tracy Letts and Julie Delpy) bring the dog home to provide companionship for their sickly son (Keaton Nigel Cooke). This family — the blustery dad; the passive-aggressive mom; the wide-eyed, question-asking child — are the most canonically Solondzian figures in the movie, its ground zero of upper-middle-class entitlement.But their presence, like nearly everyone else’s, is brief. This is an anthology of dark, deadpan comic vignettes, punctuated by an amusing fake intermission and sealed with a grim sight gag. Wiener-Dog (who is also called Doody and Cancer) is spayed and nearly euthanized, strapped with explosives and subjected to a cross-country car trip with an aimless young not-quite-couple (Greta Gerwig and Kieran Culkin), one of whom seems to be Dawn Wiener herself, the heroine of Mr. Solondz’s “Welcome to the Dollhouse” and as such an almost mythical figure in his imaginative world.Dawn Wiener used to have brown hair and used to be dead, and Wiener-Dog was her nickname in middle school back in the ’90s. In previous films — notably “Life During Wartime,” a sequel of sorts to “Happiness,” and the heroically misbegotten “Palindromes” — Mr. Solondz has messed around with conventions of story and character. He demonstrates an admirable impatience with the arcs and beats that dominate even independent-minded screenwriting, and shows a sometimes frustrating, sometimes bracing indifference to psychological continuity.“Wiener-Dog” is held together by its canine title character, whose animal dignity provides silent commentary on human folly. This conceit is clearly borrowed from Robert Bresson’s “Au Hasard Balthazar,” in which a donkey suffers for the sins of a series of owners. That Mr. Solondz’s pet lacks the noble charisma of Bresson’s beast of burden is part of the point. Bresson was interested in illuminating the tragic fallenness of the human world. Mr. Solondz exposes its smallness to the harsh glare of satire.Some of it is pretty funny, partly because of the performers Mr. Solondz has assembled. Danny DeVito is a bitter screenwriter who halfheartedly teaches college students between desperate calls to his agent. Ellen Burstyn is a bitter old woman whose granddaughter (Zosia Mamet) arrives for a visit with her artist boyfriend (Michael Shaw). Her chapter of “Wiener-Dog” has a haunting emotional resonance, as the old woman hallucinates a squad of identical red-haired children who embody her regrets and lost chances.But much of the rest is not only sour, which is only to be expected, but also tired, which is disappointing. Mr. Solondz’s eye for the petty hypocrisies and delusions of American life has lost some of its sharpness, and he flails at flabby targets — avant-garde art, campus “political correctness” — in ways that sometimes carry an ugly whiff of racial and sexual bigotry. Even his admirers may wish that this old dog would try a new trick.“Wiener-Dog” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gross human and canine behavior.

Jackson), a phlegmatic railway worker, trek from Boston’s airport to somewhere in Maine. Having narrowly escaped a murderous mob of flesh eaters — the zombified victims of a mysterious cellphone signal — the pair (mobiles presumably on vibrate) must evade additional infected hordes en route to Clay’s estranged wife and son. That’s the sole hook on which our emotional investment in Clay hangs, and it’s not nearly enough — as Mr. Cusack seems to know, giving possibly the most detached performance of his career.Even if it weren’t cheap-looking and dreary, “Cell” would still be hobbled by an entertainment landscape already lousy with zombies, and a hive-mind premise that — at least metaphorically — has been all but realized. (Its heedless infected, shuffling forward with eyes cast down, have a chilling real-world familiarity.) Only in the final seconds do we glimpse a possible focus for the narrative, but until then the director, Tod Williams (who in 2004 gave us the affecting Jeff Bridges vehicle “The Door in the Floor”) seems every bit as lost as his characters.“Cell” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

A close-up image of Hillary Clinton caps the scene. The film then recounts Mr. D’Souza’s own guilty plea to violating federal campaign finance laws. He was set up, he insists. “If you make a film criticizing the most powerful man in the world,” he says, referring to his 2012 documentary, “2016: Obama’s America,” “expect the empire to strike back.”“What if the goal of the Democratic Party is to steal the most valuable thing the world has ever produced?” Mr. D’Souza muses from a halfway house where he’s staying as part of the plea deal. In this scene, a dramatic re-enactment, he watches Ms. Clinton announce her campaign for president. “What if their plan is to steal — America?” On these words, Mr. D’Souza’s eyes shift from the ceiling-mounted TV display to stare straight into the camera. It’s very Dramatic Chipmunk.Once the hero’s journey theme is established, it’s on to about an hour’s worth of “the Democratic Party was the party of slavery” material. This content, and more (including a young actress playing Ms. Clinton as a practically lunatic student radical), will be familiar to anyone who’s examined a right-wing website.When Mr. D’Souza describes the effects of Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act, he intones, “It was a trail of tears,” as if he has just come up with the phrase. This is typical of his method. According to a certain interpretation of the auteur theory, a film’s value derives from the extent to which it communicates the personality and character of its director. Judged by that standard alone, I suppose “Hillary’s America” is some kind of masterpiece.“Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for scary images of Hillary Clinton and every other Democrat featured.",0,,,1

Dating only Caucasian men, he gives the side eye to those whose dress or behavior marks them as less assimilated than he; so when he’s assigned to facilitate the introduction of Ning (James Chen), an ostensibly straight Beijing actor, to American audiences, Ryan is less than pleased.Tugging lightly but insistently on the masks we wear in order to fit in, the film’s writer and director, Ray Yeung, creates mirror images of suppression and alienation. While Ryan is disgusted by Ning’s table manners and imperfect English pronunciation, the patriotic Ning is shocked by Ryan’s ignorance of Chinese history and openness about his homosexuality. A photo shoot that features revealing silk pajamas and a foot washing, however, is all it takes to expose rather more about Ning than his dedication to working out.Sensitive, decorous and buffed by Eun-ah Lee’s warm photography, “Front Cover” still strains to surmount its thin narrative and unfortunate dips into clichéd cultural comedy.

Suffice to say, this spinoff from the story of a magical kingdom besieged by an evil empire is too ludicrous for words.Even so, no movie this welcoming to silly hats deserves our complete condemnation. Apparently raiding “Game of Thrones,” “Lord of the Rings,” “Star Wars” and “Dune” (sandworms!), the writer and director, Takeshi Nozue, whips up a pop-culture pastiche that leaps from modern cities to medieval castles, and from paved roads to alien moonscapes with head-spinning randomness.

No, he’s just hanging out in a flawed digital backdrop of Rio de Janeiro, trying to forget his blood-spattered résumé.But for Bishop, there is no escape. When his old archenemy, the scheming businessman Crain (Sam Hazeldine), abducts Bishop’s new love, Gina (Jessica Alba), Bishop is coerced into resuming his former trade. He must deliver three “kills” for Crain, in his signature style: making the assassinations appear to be accidents.And Bishop is off on a travelogue — to a tropical prison to bump off an African warlord; Sydney, Australia, to nail a human trafficker (a lavish high-rise pool is involved); and Bulgaria to hunt an arms dealer (Tommy Lee Jones, romping in red sunglasses, a silk robe, pajamas and slippers). In Thailand, we meet Bishop’s friend the innkeeper Mei (the former martial-arts goddess Michelle Yeoh, squandered in an innocuous character role; surely she could have supplied a kick or a flip somewhere here). Events conclude with a blood bath on a yacht, complete with the time-honored ticking explosive, and a nod to the first Statham “Mechanic.”The German director Dennis Gansel, making his Hollywood debut, lacks the glossy flair of earlier Statham directors like Mr. West and Louis Leterrier (“The Transporter”). If not for Mr. Jones, “Resurrection,” while competently edited, would be devoid of humor, an area where Mr. Statham has shown promise in the past. (See: the Melissa McCarthy vehicle “Spy.”) Mostly, the movie suggests the action equivalent of 1970s European soft-core, all diffuse sun-drenched exteriors populated by attractive stars on an exotic working vacation.The sole drawback for these performers must be the material — Ms. Yeoh coasts through her role; Mr. Jones cavorts like a child in a sandbox; and Ms. Alba struggles helplessly to invigorate her damsel in distress. For an actor who, with the “Transporter” films, once imbued the action genre with a new sense of possibility and winking sophistication, Mr. Statham is on cruise control. His only unease appears in love scenes with Ms. Alba, where he revisits some of the awkwardness he displayed with Jennifer Lopez in similar sequences in their ill-fated caper, “Parker.”Mr. Statham can give thanks for his part in the coming eighth installment of the turbocharged ensemble franchise “Fast and Furious,” because his days of carrying out hits on his own may be numbered.“Mechanic: Resurrection” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for obscene language and violence.

These scenes, each set on a raft gliding on a deceptively tranquil country river, bookend a movie that raises light shivers by tapping into historical memory and employing some satisfying, bluntly old-fashioned screen magic. The movie’s visual style, narrative ellipses and weighty subject make it ready-made for the art house even if its mystical flourishes — an otherworldly claw, an undead bride — are the sort of woo-woo pleasures more often scared up in genre stories.Set in contemporary Poland, the story opens with Peter (the Israeli actor Itay Tiran), who’s moved from Britain to a small Polish town to wed a local beauty, Zaneta (Agnieszka Zulewska). Peter speaks Polish more than just passably, but he’s an outsider and treated as such by his warily welcoming future father-in-law, Zygmunt (Andrzej Grabowski). Peter seems oblivious to Zygmunt’s strained enthusiasm for the marriage and instead plunges into Zaneta’s arms and into the bonhomie of her brother, Jasny (Tomasz Schuchardt), a glad-handing bellower who likes to pass a bottle around and refers to Peter by his somewhat ominous nickname: Python.“Demon” is based on “Adherence,” by the Polish playwright Piotr Rowicki, but also shares much with “The Dybbuk: Between Two Worlds,” by the Russian ethnographer and revolutionary Shloyme Zaynvl Rapoport (a.k.a. S. An-ski). Set in an Eastern Europe town, “The Dybbuk” tells of a yeshiva student who uses kabbalistic means to win the woman he loves. Instead, he dies, and his spirit enters her body as a dybbuk — the evil soul of a dead person. (“I’ve returned to my beloved, and I’ll never leave her!”) The realms of the dead and the living are inseparable in this story, where wedding parties dance around a “holy grave” to “cheer and comfort” a couple murdered in a pogrom.The dead still cling to the living in “Demon,” blurring the divide between past and present. The Polish director Marcin Wrona, who wrote the movie with Pawel Maslona, has thoroughly reconceptualized the mythology of the dybbuk for 21st-century Eastern Europe. In his version, though, there is no holy grave; notably, there are scarcely any Jews. Instead, there are signs of prosperity, buried secrets, spooky winds, haunted streets. The opening scene sets the unsettling mood with a frontal shot of squat, barracklike buildings swathed in early morning fog. The focus then shifts to a bulldozer, which suddenly begins winding through the town’s emptied, serpentine roads.Much of what follows takes place the day of Peter and Zaneta’s wedding, beginning with his move into the dark, derelict farmhouse where the two will soon settle down. Peter has ambitious plans for their new home — he envisions a new view, a pool in the yard — and he’s soon clambered onto a bulldozer (the same or another) that’s on the property, moving trees and dirt as Zaneta prepares for their nuptials elsewhere. It’s while tooling around that Peter accidentally digs up a human skeleton, a discovery that unearths a world of trouble, most obviously in the form of a dybbuk who very soon takes possession of his body, the wedding party and the couple’s happily ever after.Mr. Wrona is very good at thickening the air with mystery, and right from the start he slips in enigmatic details and figures — the prowling bulldozer, a keening woman, a scowling man — that disturb the ordinary scene. Like pebbles dropped in water, these disturbances create concentric circles that spread, disrupting everything. By the time the newlyweds are dancing in the farmhouse barn, surrounded by raucously celebrating, progressively drunk family and friends, the dybbuk has crashed the party. Mr. Tiran’s moving, expressive performance during the possession has an acrobatic elasticity, with hints of Iggy Pop carnality and eyeball work indebted to Jack Nicholson.More mournful than frightening, the dybbuk may upend the celebrations, but the revelers do far more damage. The party begins as one of those bacchanals filled with choreographed chaos, flowing alcohol and tumbling bodies that at times seem almost mandatory in Eastern European cinema. Mr. Wrona takes an alternately cool and hot view of this tumult, by turns pulling back for critical distance, at other times diving into the muck. It’s by turns entertaining and exhausting, though eventually the whole thing grows heavier, more solemn, as the party transforms into another reminder about how rapidly the so-called civilized slip into barbarism. Because, here, as the smiles fade, the shivers turn to chills and a lost world is revealed, it becomes all too clear who haunts this land and why.“Demon” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or guardian) for some language, rivers of booze and demonic possession.

Unfortunately, it’s largely devoid of the kind of character development that can give such conversations real impact.The movie — directed by Paul Duddridge and released, of course, just in time for Mother’s Day weekend — works an intersecting-stories structure as it follows several mother-daughter pairs through tensions, tears and reconciliations. The cast includes Susan Sarandon, Sharon Stone, Courteney Cox, Mira Sorvino, Christina Ricci and Eva Amurri Martino (Ms. Sarandon’s real daughter), and they are tasked with cutting right to the chase. Having multiple plotlines eats time, and, as a result, Paige Cameron, the screenwriter, doesn’t really lay much of a foundation for any of these relationships; instead, we’ve barely registered who’s who before we are plunged into the heart-to-hearts.Subtlety is not on the agenda here, either; these are big-moment stories that involve pregnancies, revelations about who is whose biological parent, and so on. The dialogue — much of it delivered via video conference calls, for some reason — is the kind of Lifetime movie stuff that will probably strike a chord with mothers and daughters who have had similar conversations or wish they had.“When you were born, and I saw you, I didn’t know that I could ever need anything that badly, that I could ever love anything that much,” Ms. Sarandon’s character tells her daughter.

Eva Orner’s documentary, “The Network,” tours Afghanistan’s first independent TV operation and shows a burgeoning media organization still gaining its look and its polish. Though heavy with interviews that can be shallow, the movie provides an angle on a country remaking itself after Taliban rule.Tolo TV, part of the Mohseni family media empire, is chronicled here in 2011 but was started in 2004. Just as television news in the United States involved training and laying groundwork in the mid-20th century, so does this station require teams of producers, here much aided by experienced expatriates (from Australia, for example) who navigate culture clashes. Ms. Orner’s often rough-looking film slips into anecdotal reactions and lacks a clear spatial sense for the company’s layout, but we do see clips from its stable of standard genre shows.One of those shows includes “Afghan Star,” previously covered in Havana Marking’s 2009 documentary of the same name; Jehane Noujaim’s “Control Room” (2004) also comes to mind. “The Network” feels biased toward Afghanistan’s elite who left, then returned, and wedded to the perspective of the station’s personnel. Still, Ms. Orner’s presentation happens to suit the multifarious, populist notion of television — as entertainment, as a way of working through social issues, and, last but not least, as an evolving projection of national personality.",0,,,0

It’s in their nature to solve problems the family way — with baseball bats, explosives and anything at hand that leaves an opponent dead or writhing in agony. Sadistic violence is a reflexive response to having grown up in households where fathers regularly beat their sons senseless for no reason.So says Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro), a mobster in hiding, when explaining his pathological behavior in Luc Besson’s dark action comedy “The Family.” Giovanni, who ratted out his fellow mobsters to the feds and is now in the witness protection program, has a new identity. Under the name Fred Blake, he has been moved with his family to a village in Normandy. There they face many frustrations, starting with the ancient plumbing. When Giovanni’s wife, Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), shops and is snidely informed, “We don’t stock stuff like that,” she blithely burns down the supermarket. Maggie is disgusted by the French preference for butter and cream over olive oil. And in the movie’s funniest speech, she rails about the awful things these dairy products do to your insides.Ms. Pfeiffer is no stranger to mob wives, having played them wonderfully in “Married to the Mob” and “Scarface.” Because her portrayal of Maggie has only the slightest tinge of parody, her character feels authentic. When Ms. Pfeiffer tears up, which she does more than once, you weep with her.The role of Giovanni could have been a walk-through for Mr. De Niro, whose character, given his new identity, calls himself a writer and begins typing his memoirs. But Mr. De Niro gives a surprisingly nuanced performance of a monster offering a long list of bogus reasons to excuse his evil. The character is charming in a rough-hewed way, but lethal. He loves inflicting pain and misery.With their mobster lineage, the Manzoni children introduce a whole new set of values to the school in which they enroll. Sexy, tough and 17, Belle (Dianna Agron of “Glee”) has a way with a tennis racket when a boy makes an unwelcome pass. Fixing her predatory gaze on a studious young math whiz she covets, she pins him against a locked door. Her 14-year-old brother, Warren (John D’Leo), immediately sets about organizing shady larcenous operations with students who are more than eager to join his syndicate. The movie unabashedly glorifies these crime family children and portrays their Gallic counterparts as lily-livered wusses. The style of the movie — directed by Mr. Besson from a screenplay he wrote with Michael Caleo and adapted from Tonino Benacquista’s novel, “Malavita” — might be described as screwball noir. If there aren’t a lot of belly laughs, “The Family” stirs up an appalled amusement at its gleeful amorality. Some of the heartiest laughs come from the grisly scenes of Giovanni triumphantly venting his rage when he doesn’t get instant gratification or feels disrespected.The bad vibes that greet the Manzonis upon their arrival threaten to incite a massacre when they invite their neighbors to a get-acquainted barbecue, and the guests condescendingly criticize Giovanni’s grilling techniques. Giovanni, his face frozen in a facetious grin, endures their scorn while a fantasy sequence shows what he would really like to do to them. At the screening I attended, the more cruelty the Manzonis unleashed, the louder the audience cheered. That response is similar to the enthusiasm that greets Giovanni when he gets carried away with his own stories in a discussion after a local film society screening of “Goodfellas.” At his side, observing him with increasing alarm, is his F.B.I. handler (Tommy Lee Jones, in a thankless role that he manages to imbue with some gravity). When his New York enemies catch wind of Giovanni’s whereabouts and descend on the Normandy coast, the humor recedes, guns are drawn, and “The Family” transforms into a firefight in which the Manzonis heroically stand up to their would-be executioners.The movie has holes galore. It has abrupt tonal shifts, an incoherent back story and abandoned subplots. It doesn’t even try for basic credibility. But buoyed by hot performances, it sustains a zapping electrical energy.“The Family” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extreme, gory violence, strong language and sexual situations.",0,34600000.0,36918811.0,0

Set in 1930s Mexico, this spiritually driven film treks through the scrubby sun-streaked countryside with a band of Roman Catholics who took up arms against governmental persecution of people of their faith, practiced by a vast majority of the population.Mr. Meyer adheres to a cinema of broad experience by casting rugged but uninspiring nonprofessionals and focusing on the rebels’ long, lonely struggle rather than on triumph and tactics. There’s a great deal of wandering through the golden wilderness under the liberatingly gorgeous heavens, often filmed with calmly gliding dolly shots or tilts of the camera. The men long for their families, whom they visit, and some have doubts about their rebellion. Brass horns blow regular tribute in the film’s score, which also includes corridos sung on screen.Little historical background is given after an initial audio clip from a 1969 interview conducted by the director’s father, a pioneering authority on the conflict. One might gently question whether more is lost than is gained through this strategy of throwing audiences into the deep end, and whether the film’s patient evocation of martyrdom is spoiled by a concluding in-case-you-missed-it shot of them as Jesus-like figures in loincloths sprawled around a watering hole.",0,,,1

That voice — softly rounded, male, caressing, somehow naturally comforting — belongs to Henry Marsh, the British brain surgeon whose humanity and talent with power drills make him an uncommonly enthralling linchpin in the documentary “The English Surgeon.”Directed by Geoffrey Smith,  “The English Surgeon” centers largely on  Dr. Marsh’s  admirably generous charity  work in  Ukraine. He became involved in the Ukrainian medical world, he explains in a voice-over, when, after delivering a speech in that former Soviet satellite in 1992, he discovered the appalling  state of one of its hospitals.Working with a stubbornly committed Ukrainian surgeon, Dr. Igor Kurilets, he sought to improve conditions by exporting equipment, from chairs to used-if-still-usable surgical tools, and performing advanced, costly operations. Decency  appears to motivate Dr. Marsh — he doesn’t  seem to receive any monetary compensation for his trouble,  just an evident sense of well-being — as do the travails of Dr. Kurilets,  whose efforts to modernize his country’s medical system have brought him consistent grief.Dr. Kurilets, a bespectacled man whose perpetually bowed head suggests a tremendous burden, doesn’t have it easy. He rents space for his clinic from the Ukrainian Security Service (the successor to the K.G.B.) and yearns to build a hospital he can’t yet afford. He  is at constant odds with the medical establishment: he couldn’t practice for a few years because of one kerfuffle. More details and shading would be welcome, along with a few contrasting, even contesting voices, but Mr. Smith    doesn’t supply expansive historical context, professional or otherwise. Much like the doctors’ bona fides and backgrounds, the details of their personal lives remain blurred. Is the attractive, unidentified blonde hovering in Dr. Marsh’s house his wife, girlfriend? It’s uncertain.At the same time, though Mr. Smith leaves some things unsaid or only in vague outline, he rather wonderfully and appropriately does get you somewhat inside the heads of the two surgeons. You might not learn  the names of their favorite musicians or the  hospitals  where they’ve practiced, but you do discover   early on that Dr. Marsh himself builds the wood crates he uses to ship equipment to  Ukraine and that he works on the rough planks with careful, exacting movements. These early images of his hands fabricating the crates initially register as so much filler or comic relief (he does like his drills), yet it’s precisely this kind of  nominal throwaway detail that turns the good doctor into a great character.The measure of this man becomes evident incrementally in the fly-on-the-wall scenes of him consulting, joking and operating alongside Dr. Kurilets. Sitting next to each other in a cramped consulting room in the Ukrainian clinic, they examine charts, discuss treatments and deliver the sometimes heartening, sometimes wretched news to patients for whom they represent the final stop. The bleakness of the clinic is claustrophobic, unrelenting. There are moments when its grim walls and unsmiling functionaries bring to mind the Romanian drama “The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,” albeit without that fiction’s ameliorating mordant humor and intellectual distance. There is another similarity: in “Lazarescu” the sick die partly because of the indifference and poverty produced by decades of totalitarianism. The same holds true here.Although Dr. Kurilets is in many respects the more conspicuously heroic figure, Mr. Smith lavishes most of his attention on the eminently quotable Dr. Marsh. (If the British doctor is more appealing, it’s because he appears happier: he can, after all, leave the country.)  The other important character is Marian, a young man with a sizable tumor whose brain takes pride of cinematic place during an on-camera operation. Mr. Smith isn’t above exploiting his material, a tendency most evident in an abrupt image of a surgeon using an instrument that for all intents and purposes makes it look as if he were flossing a skull. As Dr. Marsh says, hospitals are full of a small number of people doing horrible things to a large number of people.Despite that gruesome shocker, Mr. Smith thankfully does prepare you for the most graphic set piece, Marian’s operation, a procedure that is, in a word, astonishing. It is, perhaps to state the obvious, unsettling if strangely reassuring to watch a skilled surgeon rummaging around the brain of another human being. Yet what resonates most deeply in this unexpectedly effective and often affecting documentary is not the whirring, grinding and wet noises of Marian’s operation or even the images of his brain pulsating under a window cut into his skull. It’s a quiet, quietly haunting scene in which the surgeons, their faces knotted and gray, struggle to find a way to tell a 23-year-old that she’s going to die. These men perform miracles, but they are also agonizingly human.THE ENGLISH SURGEONOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Geoffrey Smith;  director of photography, Graham Day; edited by Kathy O’Shea; music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis; released by Eyeline Films.

It’s nice to have Mr. Van Peebles, who grows more charismatic with age (he turns 77 on Friday), back in the center of the action after projects like the French-language curiosity “Bellyful” (2000) and the formulaic corrupt-cops television movie  “Gang in Blue” (1996), where his on-screen presence was secondary at best. It’s disappointing, though, to see that his work, while it’s become more polished, has remained essentially self-indulgent and superficial despite the big themes of racism and identity that it takes on.“Ex-Doofus,” which is a largely seamless, coherent exercise, doesn’t look much like the rough-edged “Sweetback,” but it still resonates with that earlier film. Once again the soundtrack is filled almost entirely with music,  composed by Mr. Van Peebles in styles ranging from jazz vamps to blues songs to gospel to Broadway-style light opera. Once again Mr. Van Peebles’s protagonist finds himself on the run, trying to escape across the mountains, except this time his pursuers are African soldiers rather than Los Angeles policemen. And once again the road to freedom is paved with the naked bodies of compliant women who can’t keep their hands off an African-American stud, even one who in this case is well past 70.In the film, which is one long flashback recounting the life of its title character, Mr. Van Peebles is both narrator and actor, playing the doofus at all ages: child in a Chicago tenement; teenager washing dishes in Harlem; young man traveling the world with the merchant marine; older and wiser man (hence “ex” doofus) returning to New York and the woman he loves. There’s some charm and sly humor in scenes of Mr. Van Peebles at the dinner table being lectured by a mother (Tamiko White) who is 40 or more years his junior; there isn’t (not for me in any case) in the sequence in which he tries to feel up a succession of young women in dark theaters.The coming-of-age-on-the-road story, with its echoes of Mark Twain and Chester Himes, is told in a kind of poetic cartoon style  — the Fleischer brothers appear to have been another muse  — with much handmade manipulation of the images. (Mr. Van Peebles’s credits include director, writer, composer and editor-painter.) It’s partly based on “Waltz of the Stork,” a musical monologue Mr. Van Peebles performed on Broadway in 1982, and recycles some of that show’s songs. While it doesn’t seem particularly autobiographical, beyond the Chicago childhood, it’s clearly a narrative that the artist has had rattling around in his head for a long time.“Sweetback” was both a miracle of good timing and, regardless of any other calculations that were involved, an act of bravery, a slap in the face of the movie business and white American society. “Ex-Doofus” is a better film in every technical sense  — people who had trouble sitting through “Sweetback” are likely to find “Ex-Doofus” tolerable and even pleasantly diverting  — but a lesser one where it matters. Mr. Van Peebles has led an amazing life, but this aging hipster’s fantasia doesn’t do it justice.CONFESSIONS OF A EX-DOOFUS-ITCHY FOOTED MUTHAOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written, directed, edited, composed and produced by Melvin Van Peebles; based on his forthcoming graphic novel of the same name; director of photography, John Threat; at the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village.

Some have horns; most have twitchy tails and vicious-looking teeth. The beasts snarl and howl and sometimes sniffle. One has a runny nose. Yet another has pale, smooth skin and the kind of large, wondering eyes that usually grow smaller and less curious with age. This beast is Max, the boy in the wolf costume who one night slips into the kind of dream the movies were made for.Max, played by the newcomer Max Records, is the pivotal character in this intensely original and haunting movie, though by far the most important figure here proves to be Mr. Jonze. After years in the news, the project and its improbability — a live-action movie  based on a slender, illustrated children’s book that runs fewer than 40 pages, some without any words at all — are no longer a surprise. Even so, it startles and charms and delights largely because Mr. Jonze’s filmmaking exceeds anything he’s done in either of his inventive previous features, “Being John Malkovich” (1999) and “Adaptation” (2002). With “Where the Wild Things Are” he has made a work of art that stands up to its source and, in some instances, surpasses it.First published in 1963, the book follows the adventures of Max, who looks to be about 6 (he’s closer to 9  in the movie) and enters making mischief “of one kind and another” while dressed in a wolf suit with a long,  bushy tail and a hood with ears and whiskers. After his unseen mother calls him “wild thing!” and he threatens to eat her up, he is sent to his room without dinner. But his room magically transforms into a forest and, finding a boat, he sails to a place populated by giant, hairy, scary beasts that make him their king. Eventually the tug of home pulls him back to his room, where supper (“still hot”) sits waiting.There are different ways to read the wild things, through a Freudian or colonialist prism, and probably as many ways to ruin this delicate story of a solitary child liberated by his imagination. Happily, Mr. Jonze, who wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers, has not attempted to enlarge or improve the story by interpreting it. Rather, he has expanded it, very gently. The movie is still a story about a boy, his mother, his room, his loneliness and various wild things of his creation. But now there are new details and shadings to complement the book’s material, like Max’s older sister, Claire (Pepita Emmerichs), whose lank hair and adolescent gloom are touchingly mirrored by a wild thing named K W (voiced by Lauren Ambrose).Like Mr. Sendak’s unruly boy, the movie’s Max is a storm without warning, throwing himself into the story while noisily chasing the family dog down some stairs. Shot with a handheld camera that can barely contain the boy’s image inside the frame, these clattering, jangling introductory moments are disruptive, disorienting — it’s hard to see exactly where Max and the dog are as you all tumble down — and purely exhilarating. Yet after jolting the story to excited life, Mr. Jonze quiets the movie down for a series of flawlessly calibrated scenes of Max alone and with his sister and mother (Catherine Keener), an interlude that tells you everything you need to know about the boy and that announces all that will happen next.These scenes, lasting 20 minutes or so, are achingly intimate and tender. Mr. Jonze, working with his regular cinematographer, Lance Acord,  brings you close into Max’s world as he builds an igloo in the street, starts a snowball fight with Claire’s friends and is left to weep alone after the igloo is destroyed. (When Max slides into the igloo, the camera is right there, which means that you’re there too when disaster strikes.) The world is cruel, children too, lessons that Max absorbs through a smear of tears and hurt. The wound doesn’t heal. Max clomps and then stomps and then erupts: he roars at his mother. She roars back. And, then, like his storybook counterpart — like everyone else — he sails into the world, adrift and alone.This is the existential given at the heart of both Mr. Sendak’s book and Mr. Jonze’s movie, which might come as a surprise to anyone who misremembers the original, with its dark, crosshatched lines; spiky emotions; Max’s many frowns; and the “terrible teeth” and “terrible claws” of the creatures. Though their conceptual bite remains sharply intact, Mr. Jonze’s wild things are softer, cuddlier-looking than the drawn ones because they have partly been brought to waddling life by performers  in outsize costumes. (The fluid tremors of emotion enlivening the fuzzy faces were primarily created through computer-generated animation.) The vexed, whining, caressing voices — James Gandolfini as Carol, Catherine O’Hara as Judith, Forest Whitaker as Ira, Paul Dano as Alexander and Chris Cooper as Douglas — do the expressive rest.Max discovers the wild things on an island,  destroying their homes in fury and for kicks. Introductions are made, wary sniffs exchanged. But these are his kind of beasts, after all, and so, amid the rough splendor of a primeval forest where the air swirls with pink petals and snowflakes, he becomes their king. “Let the wild rumpus start!” he yells, as all the creatures, Max now included, rampage. It’s all very new (and scary) but also vaguely familiar, because we’ve seen it before. The tantrums, tears and angry words from the film’s first 20 minutes all start to resurface during this idyll, much as our waking hours invade our dreams: the snowball fight is recast as a dirt-clod battle. Max plays the angry child and then the reproving parent.Much is left unexplained in Mr. Jonze’s adaptation, including Max’s melancholia, which hangs over him, his family and his wild things like a gathering storm. But childhood has its secrets, mysteries, small and large terrors. When a hilariously bungling teacher explains, rather too casually, that the sun is going to die, the flash of  horror on Max’s face indicates that he understands that the sun won’t be the only one to go. There are other reasons, perhaps, an absent father, a distracted mother. (And when a frightened Max listens to an argument between Carol and K W, you hear the echoes of parental discord.) But such analysis is for therapy, not art, and one of the film’s pleasures is its refusal of banal explanation.On occasion, Mr. Jonze lingers too long on his lovely pictures, particularly on the island, where the film’s energy starts to wane, despite the glorious whoops in Carter Burwell and Karen O’s score. Mr. Jonze loves Max’s wild things, but  you don’t need to hang around  long to adore them as well. Yet  these are minor complaints about a film that often dazzles during its quietest moments, as when Max sets sail, and you intuit his pluck and will from the close-ups of him staring into the unknown. He looms large here, as we do inside our heads. But when the view abruptly shifts to an overhead shot, you see that the boat is simply a speck amid an overwhelming vastness. This is the human condition, in two eloquent images.“Where the Wild Things Are” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

A photograph of the statue that morphs into a drawing of David twirling his slingshot is a recurrent image in the crisply made, largely admiring documentary “William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe.” To him, it embodied the moment everyone faces at some time or other when one has to stand up to injustice or keep silent.A refresher course on the history of American left-wing politics in the 1960s and ’70s as well as an affectionate personal biography of Kunstler, “Disturbing the Universe” was directed by Sarah and Emily Kunstler, his two daughters from his second marriage. Although the film, with its home movies and family reminiscences, portrays him as a heroic crusader for justice, it is by no means a hagiography of a man who earned widespread contempt late in his career for defending pariahs.The metamorphosis of Kunstler, who died in 1995, from armchair liberal to middle-aged hippie revolutionary reflected the volatile political climate of the era. A general-practice lawyer who lived in Westchester County, he became involved in the civil rights movement through a local housing lawsuit in 1960; the following year he flew to Mississippi at the behest of Rowland Watts, the legal director  of the American Civil Liberties Union, to support the Freedom Riders.Later he defended the Catonsville Nine  Roman Catholic activists, including Daniel and Philip Berrigan  who burned draft files to protest the Vietnam War. He achieved national notoriety as the lead counsel in the theatrical trial of the Chicago Seven, who were accused of conspiracy and inciting to riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.It was the events surrounding that trial that radicalized Kunstler, the film says. He was outraged by the treatment of the Black Panther activist Bobby Seale, the eighth defendant, whose trial was severed during the proceedings and who was bound and gagged in the courtroom after hurling invective at Judge Julius Hoffman.Several weeks later the fatal shooting of the Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in his bed by Chicago police further incensed Kunstler. The film includes an excerpt from an angry speech in which he denounced all white people (including himself) as racists.He had his first major setback in September 1971 as a negotiator and lawyer for inmates at Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York who seized the prison to demand better living conditions. After armed state troopers stormed Attica, killing dozens, he blamed his own idealism for his reluctance to tell the inmates what their options really were. Kunstler’s successful negotiation of a standoff between American Indians and the United States government at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, was a personal redemption of sorts.The critical turning point for Kunstler’s reputation was his 1986 defense of Larry Davis, a Bronx drug dealer accused of shooting six police officers. He lost more of his support after the 1991 acquittal of his client, the Egyptian-born terrorist El Sayyid Nosair, for the murder of the militant Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Jewish Defense League founder and Israeli politician. That brought picketers to the Kunstler home, and Emily, who narrates the movie, recalls that she and Sarah pretended they didn’t live there when they returned from school.Other signs that Kunstler had grown overly fond of the spotlight were his defense of a cat for “crimes against humanity” in a mock television trial and his embrace of the Mafia chieftain  John Gotti in front of the courthouse press corps. A loss of perspective and an inflated sense of self-importance: all too often these are side effects of stardom, whether in Hollywood or in the legal profession.WILLIAM KUNSTLERDisturbing the UniverseOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler; written by Sarah Kunstler; directors of photography, Brett Wiley and Martina Radwan; edited by Emily Kunstler; music by Shahzad Ismaily; produced by Emily Kunstler, Sarah Kunstler, Jesse Moss and Susan Korda; released by Arthouse Films.

O. SCOTT,A War Abroad Ignites a Battle at Home,"There is a grim timeliness to the release of “Brothers,” Jim Sheridan’s movie about the effects of war on the family of a Marine serving in Afghanistan. Whatever the other consequences of President Obama’s revised strategy in that country, we can be sure that it will yield more stories like the one told in this film. And it is sobering, eight years into the war, to reflect that in 2004, the first time this movie was made — by the Danish director Susanne Bier — it was just as topical and urgent.But this “Brothers,” like its predecessor, is in some ways less a movie about war than a movie that uses war as a scaffolding for domestic melodrama. It also follows the template of American movies about Iraq and Afghanistan in being resolutely somber and systematically apolitical: you can witness any kind of combat heroism or atrocity, and see unflinching portrayals of grief, trauma and healing. But you almost never hear an argument about the war itself, or glimpse the larger global and national context in which these intimate dramas take shape.The brothers in “Brothers” are Tommy and Sam Cahill, a reckless ne’er-do-well and a solid citizen who swap temperaments in the middle of the film. At the beginning, a twitchy, sullen Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) has just been released from prison. The crime that put him there is alluded to but never specified, and his return is overshadowed by the impending departure of Sam (Tobey Maguire) for another tour of duty. Sam is a stoic, patient man, devoted to the men he commands and also to his wife, Grace (Natalie Portman), and their two young daughters (Taylor Geare and Bailee Madison).Tommy and Sam are like Goofus and Gallant in those didactic old Highlights cartoons — at least in the eyes of their dad, Hank (Sam Shepard). A gravel-voiced former Marine with a grouchy demeanor and an unacknowledged drinking problem, Hank makes it no secret that he favors Sam and can barely stand the sight of Tommy. And when news reaches home of Sam’s death in combat, he all but wishes aloud that his other son had died.The scenes with Mr. Shepard are heavy-handed, and the film lurches between moments of fine, subtle realism and more frequent instances of blunt, blocky overstatement. The change that Tommy undergoes in Sam’s absence — he straightens up, renovates Grace’s kitchen and dotes on her kids — seems to arise less from the character’s psychology than from the imperatives of David Benioff’s script. And the story as a whole, especially after Sam returns, has a schematic quality about it.Reviewing Ms. Bier’s “Brothers” in this newspaper, Stephen Holden referred  to the ideas of the psychoanalyst R. D. Laing, who studied shifting roles and identities within family systems. The difference between that film and the remake may be that while Ms. Bier’s movie evokes psychological theories, Mr. Sheridan’s seems to be applying them.This is not always true. As he showed with “In America,” Mr. Sheridan has an especially good touch with children, and the scenes with Ms. Geare and Ms. Madison — grieving, playing, fussing with each other — are the finest and truest in the movie. Mr. Gyllenhaal and Ms. Portman, whose role is frustratingly if unsurprisingly underwritten, draw nuances out of the charged air between them. But the characters in “Brothers” are more shadows and ideas than flesh and blood. They lack specific gravity, a sense of rootedness in family and social reality that would give ballast to the film’s intense emotions.These explode into view once Sam comes home. It turns out that he was not killed at all — a somewhat improbable plot development — but rather held hostage and treated with unspeakable cruelty by his captors. Haunted by what he has seen and done, he walks through his house like a ghost and convinces himself that Tommy and Grace were sleeping together during his absence. Mr. Maguire’s performance is disciplined but also strained, as he tries to convey the anguish of a man whose personality has been thrown off balance by circumstances.And “Brothers” itself — a smart, well-meaning project — never quite pulls itself together. It has a vague, half-finished feeling, as if it had not figured out what it was trying to do. Which may amount to a kind of realism — an accurate reflection of where we are in Afghanistan.“Brothers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has graphic wartime violence and abundant profanity.BROTHERSOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Jim Sheridan; written by David Benioff, based on the Danish motion picture “Brodre” by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen; director of photography, Frederick Elmes; edited by Jay Cassidy; music by Thomas Newman; production designer, Tony Fanning; produced by Ryan Kavanaugh, Sigurjon Sighvatsson and Michael De Luca; released by Lionsgate.

A children’s entertainer who dresses up in a furry purple suit to play a comic-book character at parties, Luciano is such a sloppy entertainer that he falls asleep on the job.Although an extreme hypochondriac, he smokes and drinks to excess. During a bout of vomiting after an all-night binge he pleads for an ambulance. He obsesses that a casual fling with a woman may have left him disease ridden, although he has no  symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases.So nervous that he can fly off the handle at a moment’s notice, Luciano sends his business partner, Sherman (Martin Feldman), to the hospital after accidentally slamming a door on his neck; he throws a tantrum in a grocery store when the owner refuses to exchange some bad wine he returns. Yet for all his infuriatingly neurotic self-sabotage, Mr. Hendler makes Luciano such a lovable loser that you root for him to get over himself.“The Paranoids,” directed by Gabriel Medina from a screenplay by Mr. Medina and Nicolas Gueilburt, plays like a dawdling sitcom that strings together small incidents into not very much. At its most cohesive it examines a potentially toxic friendship between Luciano and his childhood buddy Manuel (Walter Jakob) who returns to Buenos Aires from Madrid, where he has created a hit television series, “The Paranoids.”Manuel subtly lords his success over Luciano, who has been working forever on a still-unfinished screenplay. Manuel drags along a beautiful, glum girlfriend, Sofia (Jazmin Stuart), who remains in Buenos Aires while Manuel goes to Chile on a business trip.While his friend is away, Luciano discovers that the  series’s main character, a laughingstock, is based on him. Upon returning, Manuel loftily offers Luciano a lucrative job adapting “The Paranoids” into an Argentine movie. Luciano demurs. The ugly undercurrents of their friendship come to the fore when they compete in a boxing video game.“The Paranoids” is so well-acted and has such a keen eye for detail (the Ramones poster in Luciano’s apartment certifies his flailing negativity) that you expect its pieces to jell into something larger. But just like its main character, this smart, slyly witty movie with few laughs undersells itself.THE PARANOIDSOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Gabriel Medina; written by Mr. Medina and Nicolas Gueilburt; director of photography, Lucio Bonelli; edited by Nicolas Goldbart; music by Guillermo Guareschi; art director, Sebastian Roses; produced by Sebastian Aloi; released by Oscilloscope Laboratories.

104,2010-03-19,The Ghost Writer,"Ewan McGregor, Jon Bernthal, Tim Preece, Jim Belushi","France, Germany, UK",Roman Polanski,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller",English,77.0,128.0,"Robert Harris (screenplay), Roman Polanski (screenplay), Robert Harris (novel)",2010,7.2,145246.0,84.0,2017-11-02 04:18:11,MANOHLA DARGIS,Writer for Hire Is a Wanted Man,"The darkly brooding sky that hangs over much of “The Ghost Writer,” the latest from Roman Polanski, suggests that all is grim and gray and perhaps even for naught. But this high-grade pulp entertainment is too delectably amusing and self-amused, and far too aware of its own outrageous conceits to sustain such a dolorous verdict. The world has gone mad of course — this is a  Polanski  film — so all we can do is puzzle through the madness, dodging the traps with our ironic detachment and tongue lightly in cheek.The Ghost of the title, never named in the film, is played by Ewan McGregor at his ingénue best. A writer for hire — his oeuvre is summed up by the vulgar wit of his latest effort, about a magician, “I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered” — the Ghost is tapped  for cleanup duties. The initial ghostwriter behind the unfinished memoirs of a former British prime minister, Adam Lang (a superb Pierce Brosnan), has washed up dead on an American beach. The publisher wants a completed book and presumptive best seller, and Lang, an increasingly divisive figure at home and abroad, needs the kind of tidying up that such a media event might provide. The Ghost, an agreeable, convenient blank slate (no family, no history), seems the man for the job.And what nasty work it proves to be! Based on the novel “The Ghost” by Robert Harris, who shares screenwriting credit with Mr. Polanski, the film opens   under a menacing cloak of darkness that rarely rises. An abandoned car in the first shot leads to the first ghostwriter’s beached body being lashed by ocean waters  in Martha’s Vineyard, a macabre setup that in turn leads to the Ghost receiving a thrashing in London, as he’s insulted (by an editor who thinks he’s wrong for the job); bullied (by the publisher who wants a fast turnaround); and punched (by a mugger who snatches a manuscript, mistaking it for Lang’s). By the time the Ghost meets Lang, who’s holed up at Martha’s Vineyard, he is as jumpy as the rest of us. (The film was largely shot in Germany.)Mr. Polanski is a master of menace and, working with a striking wintry palette that at times veers into the near-monochromatic — the blacks are strong and inky, the churning ocean the color of lead — he creates a wholly believable world rich in strange contradictions and ominous implications. Among the most initially confusing is Lang, a professional charmer whose beaming smiles, with their sinister undercurrent, and fits of rage convey depths that the Ghost soon begins to plumb, an endeavor that takes the shape of an investigation. This amateur sleuthing leads to unsurprising trouble, including with Lang’s wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), a brainy beauty whose relationship with her husband holds  its own secrets and is transparently meant to invoke that between Cherie Booth and Tony Blair.The parallels with Mr. Blair and Lang spice up the story, especially as references to Iraq, torture and the Central Intelligence Agency are folded into the mix and placard-waving protesters gather outside Lang’s hideaway. Fingers are pointed, though sometimes it seems not only at Lang but also at Mr. Polanski, who is under house arrest in Switzerland awaiting word on whether he will be sent back  to Los Angeles to face sentencing for having had sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Certainly the shots of Lang’s detractors, with their furiously distorted faces and accusatory placards (“guilty,” “wanted”), gives the film an extra-cinematic tang, though as with so much here, it’s also evident that Mr. Polanski is having his fun.And he’s delivering this pulpy fun at such a high level that “The Ghost Writer” is irresistible, no matter how obvious the twists. Everything — including Alexandre Desplat’s score, with its mocking, light notes  and urgent rhythms suggestive of Bernard Herrmann — works to sustain a mood, establish an atmosphere and confirm an authorial intelligence that distinguishes this film from the chaff. Unlike many modern Hollywood and Hollywood-style thrillers, which seek to wrest tension from a frenzy of cutting and a confusion of camera angles, Mr. Polanski creates suspense inside the frame through  dynamic angles and through the discrete, choreographed movements of the camera and actors. He makes especially effective use of the enormous windows in Lang’s house through which the sky and ocean beckon and threaten.It’s easy to speculate that Mr. Polanski was attracted to the theme of rewriting one’s life history. Reading a work of art through the lens of biography is seductive, particularly when an artist ventures into the explicitly personal, as he did in “The Pianist,” his 2002 film about a musician who, like him, survived the Holocaust. But such interpretations can flatten poetry into prose and also serve as strategies to neuter artists, whose works of imagination are “revealed” as nothing more than banal facts. This isn’t to deny the personal in art, only an insistence on the elusiveness of creation. Mr. Polanski’s ventures into the horrific in films like “Repulsion” might have something to do with his history, but they are also a matter of affinities, inspirations, attitudes, competencies, tastes, pleasures.In this respect “The Ghost Writer” seems to be as much about Mr. Polanski’s life as, well, that of Tony Blair, which only means that there are amusing points of convergence. Tracing the lines between fact and fiction makes for a dandy parlor game, one that Mr. Polanski obviously wants us to play, at least for a while, because such resonances have their rewards. They thicken the texture of the work, even if they don’t define it. Such thickening might seem especially critical with material as thin as “The Ghost Writer,” but these are the tools of a director working with every element at his disposal, including a colorful miscellany of emoting, popping, memorable faces (notably those of Kim Cattrall,  Tom Wilkinson, Eli Wallach and David Rintoul).It would be easy to overstate the appeal of “The Ghost Writer” just as, I imagine, it will be easy for some to dismiss it. But the pleasures of a well-directed movie should never be underestimated. The image of Mr. Brosnan abruptly leaning toward the camera like a man possessed is worth a dozen Oscar-nominated performances. And the way, when Lang chats with the Ghost —  his   arms and legs open, a drink in hand, as if he were hitting on a woman —  shows how an actor and his director can sum up an entire personality with a single pose. Mr. Polanski’s work with his performers is consistently subtle even when the performances seem anything but, which is true of this very fine film from welcome start to finish.“The Ghost Writer” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The blood count is higher in “Repo Men,” a dystopic satire, adapted from Eric Garcia’s novel “The Repossession Mambo” (Mr. Garcia wrote the screenplay with Garrett Lerner) and set 20 years in the future in a generically grungy megalopolis.An omnivorous company called the Union, which has developed synthetic, life-extending prostheses — known as artiforgs — for every body part markets these mechanisms to consumers using the aggressive scare tactics of door-to-door insurance salesmen. There is one horrible catch. The implants are prohibitively expensive (upwards of $600,000 an item), and hardly anyone can afford them.Should a recipient fall too far behind in his payments, the company’s repo men, using hand-held body scanners to identify embedded bar codes and due dates, ambush the hapless debtors. Wielding scalpels, these corporate bounty hunters, who work on commission, reclaim company property that will then be sold to another sucker.The concept of “Repo Men” has elements of “The Matrix” movies, the conehead episode of the original “Star Trek” series, “Surrogates” and Steven Spielberg’s infinitely deeper and more humane “A.I.” But most of all, it parallels “Repo! The Genetic Opera,” a cult movie musical that opened in several cities two years ago.The most colorful character in Mr. Spielberg’s masterwork, Gigolo Joe, was played by Jude Law, who stars in “Repo Men” as Remy, one of the corporation’s most gung-ho bounty hunters. Remy may be human, but he comes across as a figure almost as robotic as Gigolo Joe, minus Joe’s ever-chipper wit. Playing Remy, Mr. Law lacks Joe’s spasmodically jerky body language, but he is just as cold a fish, and flaunts the same cocksure attitude. Should anyone choose to remake “A Clockwork Orange,” the role of Alex seems ready-made for him.Remy has a grimly unhappy wife, Carol (Carice van Houten), who loathes what he does, but an adoring young son. When Carol leaves him, Remy doesn’t seem to care much about her departure; his boy is another matter.All is going swimmingly for Remy and his lumbering, possibly sociopathic partner (and childhood best friend), Jake (Forest Whitaker), until Remy suffers a near-fatal accident on the job. While reclaiming the artificial heart of a musician named T-Bone (the rapper RZA) during a mixing session, he is knocked unconscious from an electric shock that might be one of T-Bone’s improvised defenses against repossession. Emerging from a coma, Remy finds to his chagrin that he has been implanted with an artificial heart.Once back on the job, he discovers he has lost his taste for the work. His hands shake; his confidence is shattered. His impatient boss, Frank (Liev Schreiber in his coldly hearty “Glengarry Glen Ross” mode), gives Remy a few days to collect himself. When Remy fails to produce, you can see Frank’s solution coming from miles away.As a recession-era satire, “Repo Men” strikes a very bitter chord. In today’s climate of widespread home foreclosures in which most banks refuse to modify the terms of mortgages, the movie offers a grotesque funhouse reflection of this scarily Darwinian environment. Then there is the matter of escalating health care costs and the insurance industry’s resistance to reform. We are halfway there already.It may have been a shrewd business decision by the film’s director, Miguel Sapochnik, to treat the story as a nasty, comic thriller. But when, after a certain point,  “Repo Men” subsumes its satire to strenuous action sequences, it loses its edge and turns into a chase movie of no special distinction. It also becomes sentimental, as the technically heartless Remy suddenly gains his soul and sets out to destroy the Union.Mr. Law, buffed up for his role, emerges as a flailing, kicking and shooting one-man army: a bantam-weight Rambo. His partner in rebellion, Beth (Alice Braga), is a depressed nightclub singer (her signature song is “Cry Me a River”) with an almost entirely prosthetic body. When Beth remarks to Remy that at least her lips are real, it is an invitation for their first kiss, at which point “Repo Men” becomes a product as synthetic as an artiforg.“Repo Men” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The movie is extremely gory.REPO MENOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Miguel Sapochnik; written by Eric Garcia and Garrett Lerner, based on the novel “The Repossession Mambo” by Mr. Garcia; director of photography, Enrique Chediak; edited by Richard Francis-Bruce; music by Marco Beltrami; production designer, David Sandefur; costumes by Caroline Harris; produced by Scott Stuber; released by Universal Pictures.

Fast, periodically spit-funny and often grotesquely violent, the film at once embraces and satirizes contemporary action-film clichés with Tarantino-esque self-regard — it’s the latest in giggles-and-guts entertainment.The filmmaking isn’t in the same league, of course, and the blonde doing the slicing and dicing here isn’t Uma Thurman but Chloë Grace Moretz, who was 11 when she slipped into her purple wig and killer affect. (She’s now 13.) Her casting has set off alarms about the uses and abuses of child performers, though perhaps less for the violence she pantomimes than for the expletives she blithely delivers. Ms. Moretz plays Mindy Macready, a cutie-pie with blond pigtails, who regularly enters into avenger mode as Hit-Girl. With Nicolas Cage, who plays Mindy’s father, Damon, a k a  Big Daddy, Ms. Moretz is by far the best thing  about the film: she holds the screen as gracefully as she executes a running back flip.It’s a good thing, too, because without those monkey moves, Ms. Moretz’s queasy charm and Mr. Cage’s patented freak-show turn, “Kick-Ass” would quickly fade. It meanders to a start when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a high school dweeb with superhero dreams, buys a green-and-yellow wet suit and takes to the streets as the masked crusader of the film’s title. He soon finds plenty of trouble and instantaneous Internet fame, going on to attract the attention of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy as well as that of Frank D’Amico (Mark Strong), a supervillain with a couple of Warhols and a teenager (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Eventually, these parts flashily come together for the usual bang, gurgle and splurt.The man behind this bang-bang  is Matthew Vaughn, a British producer of Guy Ritchie crime films who, with “Layer Cake,” became a director of Guy Ritchie-style crime films. Mr. Vaughn wrote the screenplay for his new movie with Jane Goldman, adapting it from the comic illustrated by John Romita Jr. and written by Mark Millar. Mr. Millar also wrote the comic “Wanted,” which was turned into a similarly hyperviolent Angelina Jolie vehicle directed by Timur Bekmambetov. “Kick-Ass” has a far brighter palette than “Wanted,” but the body count and certainly its what-me-worry attitude toward bloodletting is comparable. In “Wanted,” slo-mo bullets tear through flesh,  allowing you to admire the special-effects handiwork; here, a goodfella pops a guy in a giant microwave  and asks about the setting. Bada-boom!Much as he does elsewhere in the film, Mr. Vaughn delivers that bit of nasty with a light touch, cutting from the scene right after the microwaved man, or rather his viscera, splats on the glass. (Who wants to look at that mess, right?) And so the movie keeps zip-zipping self-consciously — faster, Hit-Girl, kill, kill! — as the plot somewhat thickens. Damon turns out to have enlisted his daughter for some twisted payback, a development that, partly because of Mr. Cage and Ms. Moretz’s chemistry, proves more diverting than Dave’s adolescent delusions. Tucked inside this flick  is a relationship as kinky and potentially resonant as that between Lolita and Humbert Humbert, but you’d need a better director to pry it out.Mr. Vaughn instead just skates along, tossing in comic-book lettering and recycled action ideas and moves, including some that Quentin Tarantino exploited in the “Kill Bill” films after siphoning them off from the likes of Kinji Fukasaku. When Mindy shows up in a plaid kilt, knee-highs and a white shirt sure to bleed red, she isn’t only a joke about to detonate, she’s also a copy of a copy, except that the killer schoolgirl who rampaged through Mr. Fukasaku’s “Battle Royale” and then “Kill Bill” is now a prepubescent. That Ms. Moretz is a child complicates things partly because it raises the issue of agency or maybe lack thereof. And oh yeah: as it happens, it’s really unpleasant to watch as a child is even stage-punched.There’s something about the killer schoolgirl that turns some filmmakers on, and audiences, too — who knows what further dangers lurk beneath that kilt? However chastely, Mr. Vaughn plays on that unsettling image, which shores up the false impression that because Hit-Girl is a powerful figure she’s also an empowering one.Ms. Moretz certainly walks the walk and jumps the jump, loading a new gun in midrun like a baby Terminator. But as her deployment of a four-letter slur for women indicates, and as the cop-out last blowout only underscores, Hit-Girl isn’t a wee Wonder Woman. She’s not even a latter-day Lara Croft, who, however absurd, works on screen because of Ms. Jolie’s own outsize persona. A supergimmick, Hit-Girl by contrast is a heroine for these movie times: a vision of female might whittled down to pocketsize.“Kick-Ass” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

That’s the question in Parmeet Sethi’s “Badmaash Company,” a Hindi film about corruption and redemption.A quick mind can make a fast buck, and Karan (Shahid Kapoor) is smart. His father (Anupam Kher) has worked the same steady job for 25 years, but Karan is in a hurry. (“Jingle, jingle go all the pockets,” but “single coin is all we have,” one song lyric goes.) It’s 1994 in Bombay — back before it was Mumbai — and Karan has an idea about how to game the system. He enlists three pals in a tariff-dodging scheme, and starts making big rupees importing Reeboks.When Indian import laws change, Karan brings his mod squad to New York, where they set up shop in Queens, making shady dollars and spending them lavishly. (To celebrate a score, the gang goes to the Taj Mahal; not the one in Agra, but the Trump casino in Atlantic City.) But gaining the world, he loses his friends. And before long he lands in jail. When he gets out, he uses his powers for good.“Badmaash” (the word means scoundrel) may be a lesson in the importance of doing honest business, but it’s also an opportunity to indulge in fantasies of the good life: the cool clothes (Mr. Kapoor looks great in his rich man’s get-ups), brand names (Prada! Versace!) and shiny modern houses (ciao, Queens).In the end, honesty pays too. Karan will never do business the slow, steady way his father did — the way, the film implies, that sustained India before economic liberalization. But, it equally implies, Karan doesn’t have to. He can have it all anyway (and have it in America): respect, love, money. And that’s a potent fantasy too.BADMAASH COMPANYOpened on Friday  nationwide.Written and directed by Parmeet Sethi; director of photography, Sanjay Kapoor; edited by Ritesh Soni; music by Pritam; choreography by Ahmed Khan; costumes by Ameira Punvani and Mamta Anand; produced by Aditya Chopra; released by Yash Raj Films.

Based on a gulf-war-era video game,  “Prince of Persia” stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the titular warrior who, scrambling up walls and vaulting across roofs amid camels, pomegranates and whirling dervishes, helps lead the search in wartime for, Praise Bruckheimer, weapons of not-quite-mass destruction.As an example of the new pop-cultural crusades “Prince of Persia” is at once generically insulting and relatively innocuous. Set in the sixth century, the story involves Dastan (Mr. Gyllenhaal), the adopted son of King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), who plucked the wee boy out of the streets to raise the child alongside his royal spawn, Tus (Richard Coyle) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell). The film, directed by Mike Newell and written by Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard, pays dutiful if cursory attention to the family angle. The father imparts wise words, and the brothers clasp hands and lock gazes, but the fraternal bonds are shredded after they invade a holy city and Dastan is ensnared in a palace intrigue.Cut and chiseled, his pumped-up pectorals flashing, Mr. Gyllenhaal offers an updated spin on the mysterious Oriental lover of cinematic yesteryear. More butch than the silent-screen god Valentino (best known for playing the Sheik, an Arab rather than a Persian heartbreaker), Mr. Gyllenhaal instead follows — and runs and leaps — in the robustly muscular and acrobatic tradition of Douglas Fairbanks, the silent-film star whose Middle Eastern exploits were aggressively masculine. Granted, the resurrection of a sexpot Middle Eastern hero (even one played by a non-Persian actor) might not seem like progress. But given the strained relations between the United States and Iran, it’s a representation worth noting, particularly since Dastan’s worth is finally measured by his more peaceable actions.This topical hook doesn’t sink very deep, admittedly; like a lot of action flicks, “Prince of Persia” exploits the headlines for familiar genre high jinks. Dastan hooks up with a pouty princess (an unfortunate Gemma Arterton) and engages in some funny business with a shady wise-cracking sheik (Alfred Molina, fortunately). Ben Kingsley shows up  as Basil Rathbone, or rather Nizam, the king’s silky, suspicious  brother. Shot in Morocco and in Pinewood Studios in Britain, the film is crammed with swirling sand, milling crowds, computer-generated cities and assorted narrative bits and pieces, some borrowed from the studio playbook (everyone speaks in a British accent, even, alas, Mr. Gyllenhaal), others recycled from the video game series by Jordan Mechner, who has a story credit.The movie’s video game roots are most evident in the mechanized feel of many of the whiplash camera movements, which sharply zig and zag as if created by algorithms. Considering that he made the move from the art house to the blockbuster a few years ago with “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” Mr. Newell surely knew what he was getting himself into when he signed on with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Save for Michael Bay, who parted company with Mr. Bruckheimer a while ago, no director ever gets to put his own fingerprints on a Bruckheimer production. As usual, the talent in “Prince of Persia” is generally top notch — from the cinematographer John Seale to the parkour expert David Belle — but the ingredients have been masticated so heavily the results are mush.For the most part this is perfectly painless mush. The movie is irrepressibly silly — what were you expecting? — but a few hours of Mr. Gyllenhaal jumping around in leather and fluttering his long lashes has its dumb-fun appeal, as does the sight of Mr. Molina planting a kiss on an ostrich in a big-screen spectacle that’s as much indebted to newfangled technologies as to old-fashioned Hollywood narrative strategies. If nothing else, it’s entertaining to think about how this mash-up of ancient Persian heroics and headline news might sit with the Iranian powers that be. In March 2009 a spokesman for the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from Hollywood for “insults and accusations against the Iranian nation” over the last 30 years. Clearly, they had no idea they were about to be Bruckheimer-ed.“Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,Opposites Attract,"Recently, I saw a charming little movie about two characters, opposites in temperament and outlook, hostile at the start, who gradually learned not only to find delight in each other, but also to appreciate how much they had in common. This film is whimsical, inventive, crammed with visual virtuosity and six minutes long. It’s called “Day and Night,” and it can be seen when you purchase a ticket for “Toy Story 3.”I mention that lovely Pixar short — directed by Teddy Newton — because I didn’t have space for it in my “Toy Story” review, and also to avoid confusion with “Knight and Day,” a picture that is in every conceivable respect the opposite of “Day and Night.” A loud, seemingly interminable, and altogether incoherent entry in the preposterous and proliferating “action-comedy” genre, it stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz as a pair of hastily sketched cartoon characters hurtling from plane crash to car chase to further car, helicopter and motorcycle chases, one involving stampeding bulls.None of this would be objectionable if the director, James Mangold — who has acquitted himself admirably in such pictures as “Heavy,” “Cop Land,” “Walk the Line” and “3:10 to Yuma”  —  demonstrated any flair for silly, breakneck action choreography. Instead, the stars grimace (Mr. Cruise), screech (Ms. Diaz) and crack wise (both of them, gamely enunciating lines from a drab script by the first-timer Patrick O’Neill) in front of a green screen onto which computer-generated images have been slapped together with the meticulous care of a high school yearbook staff wielding Photoshop on deadline.Ms. Diaz is June Havens, a collection of alternately appealing and exasperating traits thrown together to satisfy market research data suggesting that audiences go for women who are tough but not aggressive, flaky but not nuts, sexy but not actually having sex, and willing to fall for a certain kind of guy without entirely losing their heads. That certain kind of guy — “I’m that guy,” is indeed one of his more memorable lines  —  would be, in this instance, Mr. Cruise, who tries to walk the dental-floss-thin line between good-humored winking and outright self-parody.He plays Roy Miller (perhaps not his real name), a C.I.A. superassassin who collides with Ms. Diaz’s character at the Wichita airport. She is going home to Boston for her sister’s wedding, while Roy is either trying to steal or trying to protect a powerful and secret energy gizmo that will eventually allow the filmmakers to introduce Paul Dano as the nerdy sidekick. Mr. Dano is especially necessary because the romantic chemistry between the principals — not unpromising in theory — sputters out like the initial blind-date spark on an early episode of a matchmaking reality show.Meanwhile, Peter Sarsgaard, equipped with a superfluous accent to show what a serious actor he is despite the numskullery surrounding him, plays the heavy, Roy’s intra-agency rival, with Viola Davis as their boss. Not a bad cast, you will have noticed. But alas, as they ricochet across the globe, from a South Pacific island to the streets of Seville, they all seem to run out of things to do. Yes, there is a glowering arms dealer (Jordi Mollà) and his thuggish minions. Yes, there are trains and choppers, knives and guns, dead bodies and stolen kisses and all the other traditional 007 accoutrements, updated ever so slightly to conform to present-day sexual mores, geopolitical confusions and technological fantasies.So what is missing? Oh, I don’t know — wit, fun, sexual tension, risk, originality. Maybe one or two other things. But will anyone notice? It is just possible that “Knight and Day” will earn some admiration because it is not a sequel or a spinoff and employs two stars who refuse to act like or resemble teenagers. The same might be said for “Killers,” of course, which was pretty much forgotten the day after it arrived in theaters a few weeks ago. “Knight and Day” may do better because of its superior pedigree and its noticeably greater expense (All those locations! All that C.G.I.!), but “Killers,” which stars Ashton Kutcher as the superassassin and Katherine Heigl as the shrieking blonde, is a marginally better movie.But back to the film at hand, though I would rather talk about almost anything else. (Have you seen “I Am Love”? Wow! Tilda Swinton! Are those World Cup vuvuzelas driving you crazy yet?)Sorry. “Sometimes things happen for a reason,” says Roy to June as he is about to board a fateful flight. It’s a statement — perhaps generally true — that applies to absolutely nothing about “Knight and Day,” including the making of the movie itself.“Knight and Day” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,Playing With Phantoms in the Northwest Woods,"Pop quiz: Name a current movie set in the Pacific Northwest in which a mopey young man with upswept hair who is frequently shirtless and played by an actor madly crushed on by millions of adolescent girls has unusually close relationships with the dead. If you guessed “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,” you are of course not wrong, but the correct answer today is “Charlie St. Cloud.”Charlie, who is played with a pleasant enough blend of geniality and melancholy by Zac Efron, is not a vampire. And the film, directed by Burr Steers (“17 Again”; “Igby Goes Down”) and based on a novel by Ben Sherwood, seems unaware of its own gothic tendencies. This is a big problem. “Charlie St. Cloud” behaves like a heart-swelling romantic melodrama with a supernatural theme, but really, given what happens, it should be a horror movie.Good manners prevent me from saying exactly what does happen, since to reveal a hugely significant plot twist in the middle of the movie would be a terrible spoiler. Then again, you might not believe me. So why don’t we let it go and note only that Charlie spends a lot of time with the ghost of his younger brother, Sam (Charlie Tahan).Even if you haven’t seen the trailers, Sam’s death is enough of a foregone conclusion that it comes as a relief when the filmmakers (and an unseen drunken driver) dispense with the boy fairly early in the movie. Charlie, who lives with Sam and their mother (a distracted Kim Basinger), is about to go off to Stanford on a sailing scholarship when the tragedy strikes.Five years later Mom has left town, and Charlie lives a semihermetic existence, working as the caretaker in the town cemetery and living amid nautical charts and old mementos in a ramshackle cottage. Every evening, when a seaside cannon signals the sunset, he goes off into the woods to play catch with Sam, one of several dead people Charlie is able to see. Some living people show up too, notably Ray Liotta as the E.M.T. — now stricken with cancer and bright-eyed with religious fervor — who saved Charlie’s life after the accident that killed Sam.All this is fine — kind of sweet, kind of creepy, though not as achy as “Ghost” or as haunting as “The Sixth Sense.” Certain logical questions do arise. For example, when a living person plays catch with an apparition from beyond the grave, visible only to him, do they use a real baseball? But such riddles are swept away when Charlie meets Tess (Amanda Crew), who has come home, after college and the death of her father, to prepare herself for an around-the-world solo sailing voyage. They begin to fall in love, which places each one in a painful predicament. Charlie has promised never to abandon Sam, while Tess (under the tutelage of a gruff coach played by Donal Logue), has the world to conquer all by herself.The movie has a convincingly romantic look and mood. The rippling water of the Pacific and the lush greenery of the coastal landscape are nicely shot by the cinematographer, Enrique Chediak, and the musical selections, while not hugely imaginative, supply a youthful kick that complements Rolfe Kent’s tear-jerking score. Mr. Efron and Ms. Crew are the kind of young actors you might be glad to see in a romantic comedy, or in the film adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel (which is something “Charlie St. Cloud,” with its coastal setting and its mawkish morbidity, superficially resembles).But no. Charlie and Tess do have a moonlit love scene in the graveyard. (“MacGruber” did this kind of thing better.) And the aftermath of that scene, when you stop to think about it, introduces an element of ickiness that destroys any emotional credibility “Charlie St. Cloud” might have had. You are not, in a movie like this, supposed to think too much; you are supposed to be transported beyond skepticism on a wave of pure, tacky feeling. Instead, in this case, you drown in sentimental, ghoulish nonsense.“Charlie St. Cloud” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Sex (kind of) and death (to some extent).CHARLIE ST.

In the background the roaring trucks of a silver-mining corporation tear up and down the dusty mountain roads; in the foreground gleaming blobs of mercury are gathered by the villagers like jewels to be treasured.Though undeniably gorgeous (Francisco Gózon’s cinematography is frequently stunning), the film’s images don’t quite add up to a satisfying whole: the theatricality of masked tableaus and endless, circular pans detaches us from the story and rebuffs emotion.Filled with mythic style and magical thinking, “Altiplano” feeds the eyes but gives rations to the mind. “Without an image, there is no story,” says Saturnina at a pivotal moment, inadvertently reminding us that the image, however arresting, may not be enough.ALTIPLANOOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Written and directed by Brosens & Woodworth; director of photography, Francisco Gózon; edited by Nico Leunen; music by H.

112,2010-09-03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:11,JEANNETTE CATSOULIS,Assaying the Norwegian Resistance,"In the search for the least-mined “Jeopardy” category, Norwegian War Heroes would probably give Gardeners of the Serengeti a run for its money. Rallying to rectify this oversight — or to atone for the embarrassment of their last major cinematic effort, “Bandidas” — the Norwegian filmmakers Espen Sandberg and Joachim Roenning have brought us “Max Manus,” a solidly acted biopic of World War II derring-do.Adopting a “Boy’s Own Paper” brand of breathless adventurism, the directors drop us onto a wintry Finnish battlefield in 1940,  where the 26-year-old Norwegian Max (Aksel Hennie) is helping the Finns beat back Stalin. Later, furious over his homeland’s rapid submission to the Nazis (and perhaps its donation of the word “quisling” to the English vocabulary), Max and some friends encourage Norwegian resistance by distributing illegal propaganda. A spell in a Scottish training camp transforms them into saboteurs, and soon they and their limpet mines are sending German supply ships to the bottom of Oslo harbor.Buffed to an expensive-looking gloss and dressed in period-perfect finery, “Max Manus” has an old-fashioned sincerity that entertains without engaging. Max’s gung-ho energy, though occasionally a liability — he shoots himself in the neck while horsing around — propels a screenplay by Thomas Nordseth-Tiller that remains stubbornly distant and boyishly rash. Not even the requisite love interest (Agnes Kittelsen, delightful) and elegantly nasty Nazi (Ken Duken, devastatingly charismatic) can temper the youthful aroma of dash, decency and danger-be-damned.MAX MANUSOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Espen Sandberg and Joachim Roenning; written by Thomas Nordseth-Tiller; director of photography, Geir Hartly Andreassen; edited by Anders Refn; music by Trond Bjerknaes; production designer, Karl Juliusson; costumes by Manon Rasmussen; produced by John M.

A good owl, Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess), is kidnapped, and sees his brother, Kludd (Ryan Kwanten), lured to the evil side. Soren escapes to alert his flock, and soon winged warriors are donning helmets and metal claws and swooping vengefully in slow-motion conflagration.Mr. Snyder, an old hand at green-screen effects, now has an entirely digital canvas to play with, and every feather, sunset and 3-D perspective (it is in both 3-D and normal formats) is rendered in impeccable detail. The voice talent, much of it Australian (Sam Neill, Hugo Weaving, Abbie Cornish), is also top-notch. If only the premise weren’t so familiar and the female characterizations so tiresomely backward (Helen Mirren is an imperious harpy, while Soren’s friend Gylfie, played by Emily Barclay, is wide-eyed, fragile and helpless).“Legend of the Guardians” may be a hoot, but for all its pyrotechnics, it fails to soar.“Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for violent but gore-free nipping and clawing.LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANSThe Owls of Ga’HooleOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Zack Snyder; written by John Orloff and Emil Stern, based on the “Guardians of Ga’Hoole” novels by Kathryn Lasky; edited by David Burrows; music by David Hirschfelder; production designer, Simon Whiteley; produced by Zareh Nalbandian; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

O. SCOTT,"Dad Is Distracted by Life, Work and a Motherless 10-Year-Old Daughter","The wanton slaughter of mothers and the consequent struggles of grieving single dads has been an epidemic in Hollywood for a long time, and not only in movies starring John Cusack. “Quiet Chaos,” a new film from the Italian director Antonello Grimaldi, demonstrates that the sad-dad melodrama is a global (or at least a  midlevel European art film) phenomenon. If the film is less maudlin and more psychologically astringent than most American specimens, this is partly a matter of Mr. Grimaldi’s restraint and partly thanks to Nanni Moretti’s sharp and unpredictable turn as the dad in question.Mr. Moretti, who wrote the screenplay for “Quiet Chaos” with Laura Paolucci and Francesco Piccolo, is essentially a comic actor, but he is no stranger to bereavement as a subject. In “The Son’s Room,” which he  directed (and which won the top prize in Cannes in 2001), he played a father sent reeling by the sudden death of a child. Here, as Pietro, a top executive in a multinational media company, he does not so much reel as blink, stumble and brood. He also has lunch and, since this is a midlevel European art film, some rough sex with a beautiful woman (Isabella Ferrari).The film begins with a brutal, jolting coincidence. At the beach near their summer villa Pietro and his brother, Carlo (Alessandro Gassman) rescue two women from drowning, an event that is nearly simultaneous with an unspecified accident (it seems to involve cantaloupe) that kills Pietro’s wife, Lara. He is left with their 10-year-old daughter, Claudia (Blu Yoshimi), and a welter of confused emotions and reactions.At the office things are heating up as Pietro and his colleagues (including the wonderful French actors Charles Berling and Hippolyte Girardot) debate a possible merger with another company, but Pietro abandons work, spending his days loafing in a small park near Claudia’s school. As the days stretch into weeks, he becomes something of a neighborhood character, a benign, eccentric presence whose watchful, diffident manner arouses sympathy and mild curiosity from other habitués of the area.At its best “Quiet Chaos” lives up to its name, enmeshing its protagonist in a complicated, lived-in reality that obstructs his attempts to clear his head and organize his feelings. He passes the time by making mental lists — airlines he’s flown, houses he’s lived in — but other people keep interrupting him.His wife’s sister, Marta (Valeria Golino), shows up with her own minor melodramas and with some interesting background about Pietro’s marriage. Guys from work seek him out with business updates, and he handles everything with a distracted air that hovers between worry and amusement.Thankfully, Mr. Grimaldi and the screenwriters have no great lessons to impart or messages to deliver, and the film, while uneven — sometimes too on the nose, sometimes anecdotal and diffuse — is generally absorbing, thanks mostly to the quality of the acting. There is one climactic moment that is both jarring and wonderful in ways that have nothing to do with the story; it’s a surprise twist of casting, not of plot. I don’t want to spoil anything, but let’s just say that “Quiet Chaos,” in addition to its other, rather modest virtues, earns a special place in the movie-trivia pantheon,  midlevel European art-film division, since it is perhaps the only film in which two consecutive winners of the Palme d’Or  appear on screen together.QUIET CHAOSOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Antonello Grimaldi; written by Nanni Moretti, Laura Paolucci and Francesco Piccolo; director of photography, Alessandro Pesci; edited by Angelo Nicolini; music by Paolo Buonvino; production designer, Giada Calabria; produced by Domenico Procacci; released by IFC Films.

Its on-screen and unlikely escape artist is Carl Fredricksen, a widower and former balloon salesman with a square head and a round nose that looks ready for honking. Voiced with appreciable impatience by Ed Asner, Carl isn’t your typical American animated hero. He’s 78, for starters, and the years have taken their toll on his lugubrious body and spirit, both of which seem solidly tethered to the ground. Even the two corners of his mouth point straight down. It’s as if he were sagging into the earth.Eventually a bouquet of balloons sends Carl and his house soaring into the sky, where they go up, up and away and off to an adventure in South America with a portly child, some talking (and snarling and gourmet-cooking) dogs and an unexpected villain. Though the initial images of flight are wonderfully rendered — the house shudders and creaks and splinters and groans as it’s ripped from its foundation by the balloons — the movie remains bound by convention, despite even its modest 3-D depth. This has become the Pixar way. Passages of glorious imagination are invariably matched by stock characters and banal story choices, as each new movie becomes another manifestation of the movie-industry divide between art and the bottom line.In “Up” that divide is evident between the early scenes, which tell Carl’s story with extraordinary tenderness and brilliant narrative economy, and the later scenes of him as a geriatric action hero. The movie opens with the young Carl enthusing over black-and-white newsreel images of his hero, a world-famous aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Shortly thereafter, Carl meets Ellie, a plucky, would-be adventurer who, a few edits later, becomes his beloved wife, an adult relationship that the director Pete Docter brilliantly compresses into some four wordless minutes during which the couple dream together, face crushing disappointment and grow happily old side by side. Like the opener of “Wall-E” and the critic’s Proustian reminiscence of childhood in “Ratatouille,” this is filmmaking at its purest.The absence of words suggests that Mr. Docter and the co-director Bob Peterson, with whom he wrote the screenplay, are looking back to the silent era, as Andrew Stanton did with the Chaplinesque start to “Wall-E.” Even so, partly because “Up” includes a newsreel interlude, its marriage sequence also brings to mind the breakfast table in “Citizen Kane.” In this justly famous (talking) montage, Orson Welles shows the collapse of a marriage over a number of years through a series of images of Kane and his first wife seated across from each other at breakfast, another portrait of a marriage in miniature. As in their finest work, the Pixar filmmakers have created thrilling cinema simply by rifling through its history.Those thrills begin to peter out after the boy, Russell (Jordan Nagai), inadvertently hitches a ride with Carl, forcing the old man to assume increasingly grandfatherly duties. But before that happens there are glories to savor, notably the scenes of Carl — having decided to head off on the kind of adventure Ellie and he always postponed — taking to the air. When the multihued balloons burst through the top of his wooden house it’s as if a thousand gloriously unfettered thoughts had bloomed above his similarly squared head. Especially lovely is the image of a little girl jumping in giddy delight as the house rises in front of her large picture window, the sunlight through the balloons daubing her room with bright color.In time Carl and Russell, an irritant whose Botero proportions recall those of the human dirigibles in “Wall-E,” float to South America where they, the house and the movie come down to earth. Though Mr. Docter’s visual imagination shows no signs of strain here — the image of Carl stubbornly pulling his house, now tethered to his torso, could have come out of the illustrated Freud — the story grows progressively more formulaic. And cuter. Carl comes face to face with his childhood hero, Muntz, an eccentric with the dashing looks and frenetic energy of a younger Kirk Douglas. Muntz lives with a legion of talking dogs with which he has been hunting a rare bird whose gaudy plumage echoes the palette of Carl’s balloons.The talking dogs are certainly a hoot, including the slobbering yellow furball Dug  and a squeaky-voiced Doberman, Alpha (both Mr. Peterson), not to mention the dog in the kitchen and the one that pops open the Champagne. And there’s something to be said about the revelation that heroes might not be what you imagined, particularly in a children’s movie and particularly one released by Disney. (Muntz seems partly inspired by Charles Lindbergh at his most heroic and otherwise.) But much like Russell, the little boy with father problems, and much like Dug, the dog with master issues, the story starts to feel ingratiating enough to warrant a kick. O.K., O.K., not a kick, just some gently expressed regret.“Up” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A wee bit of gentle action and a climactic fight scene, but nothing inappropriate for any viewer of any age.UPOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Pete Docter; co-directed by Bob Peterson; written by Mr. Docter and Mr. Peterson based on a story by Mr. Docter, Mr. Peterson and Tom McCarthy; director of photography, camera, Patrick Lin; director of photography, lighting, Jean-Claude Kalache; edited by Kevin Nolting; music by Michael Giacchino; production designer, Ricky Nierva; produced by Jonas Rivera; released by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios.

An old trick used to soften facial lines, greasing a lens or filter can diffuse the image and, much like candlelight, bring a touch of glamour to a scene. And if ever a movie needed to have its hard lines eased with some cheap glamour, it’s this one: a crude gloss on Dickens’s “Christmas Carol,” it tracks a high-flying photographer who, on the eve of his brother’s marriage, is forced by several ghosts to revisit a life dedicated to sexual catch and release.Matthew McConaughey, flashing choppers so blindingly white that he could light his own premiere, plays Connor Mead, one of those rom-com  roués whose itchy libidos hide the usual sensitive soul. He’s a cad — he breaks up with three women simultaneously during a video conference — but, really, he’s just heartbroken and waiting for the right woman to help him heal. That would be Jenny Perotti, a childhood friend played by an uncharacteristically hesitant Jennifer Garner, whose performance suggests that she knows  that she’s strictly backup. Less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in Jon Lucas and Scott Moore’s screenplay), she delivers her indulgent smiles so wanly that her requisite thaw feels more like capitulation than like love.The director Mark Waters, who typically does better by his actresses, proves of no help to Ms. Garner or anyone else. (Given his smoother work on “Freaky Friday” and “Mean Girls,” it’s hard not to wonder if this production itself were haunted.) Whether by contract or default, “Girlfriends” is strictly a one-man show, a vehicle for Mr. McConaughey’s diminishing returns. While there’s still a little charm under that permatan, it’s getting tougher for him to sell the goods on only a smile. He might still be capable of delivering an actual performance again, giving up something other than mannerisms (sauntering walk, crinkling eyes, flashing grin), but he needs a director who can help him get going. Age isn’t easy, even for golden boys.The movie  makes much the same point with Uncle Wayne, Connor’s lifelong bad influence. Played by an insistently watchable Michael Douglas, Uncle Wayne is a cautionary tale incarnate: an old-school playboy wrapped in a leathery casing who appears to have been at least partly based on the Hollywood producer Robert Evans. Now mostly famous for being famous and, to an extent, for his autobiography, “The Kid Stays in the Picture,” Mr. Evans produced classics like “Chinatown” once upon a time. Although Mr. Douglas’s face is often obscured with tinted, oversize glasses and a luxurious wave of hair, almost as if he were trying to duck the camera, he brings this ghost to freakish life. The lizard king  no longer rocks, but he certainly does slither.“Ghosts of Girlfriends Past” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Sexual stereotypes galore.GHOST OF GIRLFRIENDS PASTOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Mark Waters; written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; director of photography, Daryn Okada; edited by Bruce Green; music by Rolfe Kent; production designer, Cary White; produced by Jon Shestack and Brad Epstein; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

117,2009-04-03,Adventureland,"Jesse Eisenberg, Kelsey Ledgin, Michael Zegen, Ryan McFarland",USA,Greg Mottola,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",English,76.0,107.0,Greg Mottola,2009,6.8,144323.0,88.0,2017-11-02 04:18:09,A. O. SCOTT,Coming of Age on the Midway,"It’s the summer of 1987. The stock market crash is a few months off, but for James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) things have already taken a recessionary turn. His father (Jack Gilpin), a wilted, weak-chinned alcoholic, has been demoted, and the resulting financial pinch puts the kibosh on James’s rather modest postcollegiate dream of a summer in Europe followed by graduate school at Columbia. (His sights were set on journalism school, and given what his midcareer, 40-something self would be facing two decades later, it’s probably just as well he didn’t go.)Anyway, like so many other members of a generation unfairly stigmatized at the time as slackers, James moves back in with Dad and Mom (Wendie Malick), who live in standard suburban discomfort in western Pennsylvania. Finding that a B.A. in comparative literature qualifies him for fairly little in the way of paid work, James takes a position manning the midway games at Adventureland, a sad little amusement park that serves as the employer of last resort for the area’s misfit young.Apart from a certain gangly, nerdy charm — Mr. Eisenberg’s stock in trade, already evident in “Roger Dodger” and “The Squid and the Whale”  — James doesn’t have much in the way of assets: his virginity, a bag of joints (courtesy of a preppy college pal) and a bookish naïveté, all of which you can be sure he will be rid of by the time “Adventureland” is over.The film, written and directed by Greg Mottola (“The Daytrippers,” “Superbad”), plants its flag in thoroughly explored territory, but that familiarity turns out to be integral to its loose and scruffy appeal. Somehow the story of a young man’s coming of age never gets old, at least when it is told with the kind of sweetness and intelligence “Adventureland” displays.The engine that drives most film comedy these days is the male flight from maturity. John Updike famously observed that an American man is “a failed boy.” The endless parade of movies that bear the name or show the influence of Judd Apatow (a producer of “Superbad”) blunts the tragic implication of that claim by insisting that a man is a successful boy, who gets to keep his toys and his pals even as he acquires the benefits and obligations of heterosexual monogamy. The humor in these comedies is based on various forms of sexual unease, in particular a jokey, half-panicky homoeroticism complemented by a semiterrified  fascination with those oddly shaped, emotionally inscrutable creatures known as women.The cast of “Adventureland” includes a few members of the Apatow stock company (notably Bill Hader as one of the park’s owners and Martin Starr as a nebbishy colleague of James’s with a fondness for Gogol). But in spite of this family resemblance, Mr. Mottola’s film is a relatively sober and cerebral affair, more akin to Richard Linklater’s “Dazed and Confused” than to “Knocked Up” or “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.”It’s not just that James is an intellectual with a literary bent that suggests a latter-day Woody Allen or Philip Roth hero. It’s more that his innocence expresses itself less as an anxious mystification of women and sex than as a romantic idealization of (gulp) love.No sooner has James started at Adventureland than he is smitten — as what literature major worth his Rilke would not be? — with Em, a moody, leggy N.Y.U. student played by Kristen Stewart. Em is secretly involved with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), an older, married maintenance man who impresses his younger co-workers, male and female alike, with transparently bogus tales of hobnobbing with famous musicians. “Did you know he jammed with Lou Reed?” Back in the ’80s, wherever you went, there was always some guy hanging around who had jammed with Lou Reed, even if Lou Reed never was much for jamming.But the drop of Mr. Reed’s name allows “Adventureland” to make heartfelt use of “Satellite of Love,” one of his loveliest songs and part of a soundtrack that runs the gamut of more or less period-appropriate sounds, from the sublimity of Hüsker Dü to the ridiculousness of a bar band covering Foreigner. Otherwise Mr. Mottola is careful not to fetishize or lampoon the 1980s with silly hairdos or too-obvious topical references.Nor does he lean too heavily on the central romantic plot, allowing the film, true to its season of idleness and drift, to meander from one thing to another. There is some exemplary silliness from Mr. Hader and the peerless Kristen Wiig, who plays his character’s wife and business partner, but the jokes tend to be sly rather than broad, and Mr. Mottola never sacrifices tenderness of feeling for a cheap laugh. Minor characters who might have been mean, tossed-off caricatures — like the theme-park bombshell known as Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva) — are endowed with the capacity to change and surprise, almost as if they were the protagonists of their own movies.“Adventureland” sometimes seems to lose track of just which movie it is, and its sprawling narrative encompasses some soft spots and patches of inconsistency. The worst of these comes near the end, with a failure of compassion on James’s part that seems to owe more to the demands of the plot than the logic of the character. And at times Mr. Mottola lays on the suburban adolescent malaise with too heavy a hand.Over all, though, the smart, slightly depressive vibe feels just right — for James’s era and for our own as well. The path to adulthood is lined with disappointment, but for a young man with an open heart and a measure of self-confidence, to say nothing of a degree in comp lit, things will most likely be O.K.“Adventureland” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A little sex and a lot of pot smoking. Ah yes, the ’80s.ADVENTURELANDOpens on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Greg Mottola; director of photography, Terry Stacey; edited by Anne McCabe; music by Yo La Tengo; production designer, Stephen Beatrice; produced by Ted Hope, Anne Carey and Sidney Kimmel; released by Miramax Films.

Perhaps it’s faith in the marketing strategy of borrowing the signature word from the title of someone else’s very popular trilogy and hoping people will turn up at your film thinking that Johnny Depp is providing the voices.Alas, he is not. Maybe the film is trying to pay Mr. Depp and his “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies homage by dropping in a reference to his earlier “Edward Scissorhands,” even though that film came out at least 10 years before anyone in the target audience was born. Less easy to explain is its reference to “Scarface,” one of the least faith-and-values-based movies ever made.The writer, Phil Vischer, doesn’t have the ear or timing to make such asides work for the adults or the kiddies; this is no savvy “Toy Story.” It’s a boilerplate plot like one you might find in any morning cartoon.

Blind since the age of 5, Sydney is unprepared when a cornea transplant not only restores her sight but also allows her to see dead people. As the departed stalk her in elevators and accost her in corridors, Sydney resolves to trace the origins of her new peepers. Naturally, every step of this journey must be spelled out — twice.The original “Eye,” directed by the Thai filmmakers Danny and Oxide Pang, was an insinuating ghost story that cleverly exploited cinema’s fascination with all things ocular. But what the Pangs accomplished with little more than a talent for framing and focus, this remake (directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud) fails to achieve, despite an arsenal of strobe lighting and crashing chords. The debt owed by both movies to “The Sixth Sense” and “The Mothman Prophecies” is only more obvious.Louder and more literal than its inspiration, “The Eye” benefits from a spiky performance by Alessandro Nivola as Sydney’s rehabilitation counselor. “Your eyes are not the problem,” he tells her at one point.

A courtside announcer declares, “The fact that Jackie has never been on roller skates before has apparently done nothing to diminish his confidence.”Mr. Ferrell’s latest star vehicle, a raunchy, R-rated goof written by Scot Armstrong and directed by Kent Alterman, isn’t as tenderhearted as Mr. Ferrell’s “Elf,” nor does it hit the surreal peaks of “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” with its jazz flute solos and gang fights between news teams. But like many of Mr. Ferrell’s recent films, “Semi-Pro” finds the sweet spot between sports melodrama and parody, and hammers it for 90 diverting minutes.Jackie, a one-hit-wonder pop star turned sports impresario, is a standard-issue Ferrell type: an alpha-male doofus leading like-minded dudes (including Woody Harrelson as a former bench-warming Boston Celtic and André Benjamin as a selfish but talented future star) on a mission of excellence. For the Tropics that means standing out during the final season of the American Basketball Association, a down-market rival of the National Basketball Association, which   merged with the N.B.A. in 1976, with only a few teams joining the fold. If Jackie’s team doesn’t finish at least fourth in the league and draw 2,000 spectators a game, it won’t survive the merger. Desperation and inspiration ensue.“Semi-Pro” is no docudrama, of course. The A.B.A. never had a team in Flint, much less an owner-coach-player who wrestled grizzlies and promised every spectator a free hot dog if his team broke 125 points. But the film does root many of its jokes in sports history. The A.B.A.’s contributions to pro basketball include the slam-dunk contest, the three-point shot and Julius Erving, nicknamed Dr. J, who played for two A.B.A. teams, the New York Nets and the Virginia Squires. In its absurdist way, “Semi-Pro” alludes to all of the above — including Dr. J., who seems a partial inspiration for Mr. Benjamin’s character.Like “Anchorman,” “Semi-Pro” pictures the ’70s as a clown’s bacchanal, an era that saw Age of Aquarius utopianism morph into decadent brutishness. (Jackie, an exemplar of both extremes, slaps his players and threatens referees with death, yet insists that his motto is “E.L.E.: Everybody Love Everybody.”) Between its Me Decade jukebox soundtrack, sinuous widescreen photography (by Shane Hurlbut) and fetishistic period details (including the most stunning array of big hair this side of a Tower of Power album cover), “Semi-Pro” often plays like a wacky, sports-themed cousin of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Boogie Nights.”While the film never coheres into a great comedy, it offers lively performances (including Will Arnett’s  foulmouthed, alcoholic, chain-smoking sportscaster, and Andrew Daly as his unflappably square partner).And some of its gags are as insightful as they are ludicrous. One of the best finds Mr. Harrelson’s player-turned-coach, Monix, setting up a tryst with his ex-girlfriend Lynn (Maura Tierney) by dispatching her boyfriend, an obsessive Monix fan named Kyle (Rob Corddry), to buy him a tube of Bengay. The poor dope forgets his wallet, returns to the house and catches the couple in the act, but does not react as you would expect. In fact, his response takes sports fandom to a whole new level.“Semi Pro” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for profanity and some sexual content.SEMI-PROOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Kent Alterman; written by Scot Armstrong; director of photography, Shane Hurlbut; edited by Debra Neil-Fischer and Peter Teschner; music by Theodore Shapiro; production designer, Clayton Hartley; produced by Jimmy Miller; released by New Line Cinema.

And even allowing that Sundance audiences are notoriously unreliable arbiters of quality — for every “Spanking the Monkey,” there’s a “Spitfire Grill” and a “Quinceañera” — their wholehearted embrace of this manipulative, saccharin product is dispiriting.Like “Cinema Paradiso” and its tyke-centered ilk, “Under the Same Moon”  places all its marketing eggs in the cute-kid basket, a container to which American art-house audiences seem particularly drawn. This time the bowling-ball eyes and scripted precociousness belong to the 9-year-old Carlitos (played by the 13-year-old Adrián Alonso), a Mexican moppet whose mother, Rosario (Kate del Castillo), works as an illegal domestic in Los Angeles. Every week Rosario calls her son from the same pay phone,  while the movie milks sentiment from their separation and semaphores their reunion, an event as preordained as the end credits.If only predictability were the worst of it. When Carlitos loses his caretaker and resolves to journey to Los Angeles on his own, the movie lines up a succession of nasty gringos to block his path. As he evades the clutches of a drug addict, child traffickers and the United States Border Patrol, nonwhites rally to protect him in the form of kindly migrant workers and traveling musicians. Meanwhile, jaunty musical interludes ensure that none of this becomes too depressing.Of course Carlitos, with his preternatural composure and limitless spunk (the actor is a veteran of five features and countless television commercials), is never in any real danger. Besting challenges ranging from the implausible  to the shamelessly contrived, the boy soldiers on to Mommy and an ending requiring the suspension of not only disbelief but also of all cognitive function.Written by Ligiah Villalobos — who worked as a studio executive and knows what sells — and directed, with visible earnestness, by Patricia Riggen,  “Under the Same Moon” blunts the hard edges of immigration with a thick coating of preciousness. Despite engaging performances from Ms. del Castillo and the terrific Eugenio Derbez as a testy road warrior — and some astute “Ugly Betty” product placement in the form of an America Ferrera cameo — the movie appears intended solely to encourage critics to wear out the word “heartwarming.”This is screenwriting by numbers. Unlike, say, Ken Loach’s marvelous “Bread and Roses,”  “Under the Same Moon” is too busy sanctifying its protagonists and prodding our tear ducts to say anything remotely  novel about immigration policies or their helpless victims. The filmmakers know that middlebrow movie audiences prefer their thorny social issues served lite and with a side order of ham, an opportunity to shed happy tears and enjoy a guilt-free drive home to the (let us hope, legal) baby sitter.“Under the Same Moon” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has bad white people, hard-working brown people and morally ambivalent people of mixed race.UNDER THE SAME MOONOpens on Wednesday nationwide.Directed by Patricia Riggen; written (in Spanish and English, with English subtitles) by Ligiah Villalobos; director of photography, Checco Varese; edited by Aleshka Ferrero; music by Carlo Siliotto; production designers, Gloria Carrasco and Carmen Giménez Cacho; produced by Ms. Riggen and Gerardo Barrera; released by Fox Searchlight Pictures and the Weinstein Company.

SCOTT,"Behold a Dark Horse, Bowing to Everyone","“Campaign,” a fascinating Japanese documentary opening Monday at the Museum of Modern Art, is likely to challenge some very basic American assumptions about democracy. Not about its virtues as a political system necessarily, but more about the kind of person who runs for office. We tend both to reward and to criticize candidates who show outsize ambition, even when seeking low-level offices, and  to employ  a vocabulary of clichés —  Do you have what it takes? A fire in the belly?  —  to describe the passion that drives aspirants to kiss babies and shake hands in pursuit of power.The main character in “Campaign,” in contrast, seems to be running in a 2005 by-election —  for a city council  seat in  Kawasaki, a city near   Tokyo —    because he has nothing better to do. Or rather because the party bosses who engineer his campaign, and control his every action in the course of it, couldn’t find anyone better. Since they belong to the ruling Liberal Democrats and expect to hold the seat in any case, they don’t necessarily need or want a charismatic firebrand. They have one at the head of  the party, in the person of Junichiro Koizumi, who was then prime minister. Kazuhiko Yamauchi, a 40-year-old entrepreneur of sorts with no political experience, seems immature, anxious, deeply confused and eager to please. Hardly a stirring campaigner, he dutifully leaflets outside of subway stations and bows before his masters, who exclude him from meetings and barely allow him to participate in his own rallies.At first the film, directed and produced by Kazuhiro Soda, seems to be a long inside joke at Mr. Yamauchi’s expense. His puppyish enthusiasm and meek obedience make him seem like a fool, the obliging puppet of an efficient and impersonal political machine. (Why the party didn’t choose his more poised and polished wife to run is an interesting question, though perhaps one that answers itself.) But as “Campaign” winds on toward a rather anticlimactic election day, Yama-san, as the candidate is known, becomes sympathetic as well as pathetic. And Mr. Soda’s close observation of the Japanese political process suggests a broader critique of a society deeply committed to rituals of public humiliation.Which may, come to think of it, describe campaigning in other countries too. Appreciation of this film hardly depends on an intimate knowledge of or interest in Japanese politics; the candidate and his prospective constituents don’t manifest much of either. Instead Mr. Soda uses tried-and-true fly-on-the-wall techniques to create a real-life satire. “Campaign” may invite a certain skepticism about democracy, but it will surely restore your faith in cinéma vérité.CAMPAIGNOpens on Monday  in Manhattan.Directed and edited by Kazuhiro Soda; in Japanese, with English subtitles; director of photography, Mr. Soda.

123,2008-05-23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:07,A. O. SCOTT,"The Scenery’s Gorgeous. You Want a Plot, Too?","Claude Lelouch’s “Roman de Gare” is a thriller, a murder mystery and a somewhat self-conscious literary puzzle. All of that is entertaining enough, if a bit preposterous and overdone, but the twists and convolutions of the film’s beginning and end enable a middle that is dizzying domestic comedy.A sleek Citroën pulls up at a muddy, care-worn farmstead at the foot of the French Alps, and what follows is  24 hours (around half an hour as the audience measures time) of sexual, social and familial absurdity. Huguette (Audrey Dana), a chain-smoking, emotionally brittle woman, has come back to her native village from Paris with the man she introduces to her parents, and to her semi-estranged adolescent daughter, as Paul, her fiancé. This “Paul” (Dominique Pinon) is a doctor, and Huguette’s sturdy peasant kinfolk view him a little warily before he breaks the ice with magic tricks and easygoing banter. But the high comedy of this visit is offset, and intensified, by acute anxiety.Huguette and the audience know full well that this man is not Paul; the real Paul (Cyrille Eldin) abandoned her at a highway service station after a fight, and this fellow is a stranger who hung around and offered her a ride. He is either a schoolteacher on the run from a humdrum provincial existence, a ghost writer employed by a famous novelist, or a serial killer and child rapist recently escaped from prison. Mr. Lelouch, a deft manipulator of expectations and emotions, makes all three identities seem, for a while, equally plausible, while Alex Jaffray’s slyly sadistic score leads us to anticipate the worst.Which is part of the fun, after all. And if “Roman de Gare” never quite lives up to the sheer delightful audacity of its mock-pastoral comic middle, it dispenses a few other pleasures en route to the talky, deflating revelations of its climax.One of these is Fanny Ardant as Judith Ralitzer, the author whose ghostwriter “Paul” might turn out to be. A picture of world-weary elegance who adds a hint of existential suffering to her most offhand moments, Ms. Ardant brings grande-dame gravity to what is at heart a frothy and contrived diversion.The title —  “Roman de Gare” is idiomatically equivalent to “airport novel” —  promises as much. But Mr. Lelouch is a director who likes to travel first class. A subplot set in Burgundy may be curiously tangential to the main narrative, but it allows for shots of vintage sports cars, opulent estates and rolling vineyards. Similarly, there is no real reason for so much action to take place on a handsome yacht anchored in Cannes. But then again, why wouldn’t you shoot a movie on a handsome yacht anchored in Cannes?Or, failing that, what could be wrong with watching a movie where you will never have to wait very long to gaze upon a gorgeous landscape, a beautiful woman or a glass of excellent wine? At a time when many European filmmakers are rediscovering the virtues of austere realism, Mr. Lelouch unapologetically trades in luxury and fantasy. This predilection has, perhaps, prevented him from enjoying much in the way of critical esteem, but “Roman de Gare” at least offers testament to his skills.Not the least of these is an ability to draw captivating and surprising performances from his actors. Ms. Dana is, at first, such a bundle of rage, insecurity and need that sympathy seems out of the question. And Mr. Pinon, with his half-squashed face and twitchy demeanor, seems far too creepy and skittish to carry the movie anywhere interesting. And yet between them they supply a twist of psychological delicacy that is ultimately more interesting than the mechanics of the plot. Which exist, ultimately, as a way of passing the time without too much tedium or strain.“Roman de Gare” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for brief language and sexual references.ROMAN DE GAREOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written (in French, with English subtitles), produced and directed by Claude Lelouch; director of photography, Gérard de Battista; edited by Stéphane Mazalaigue and Jean Gargonne; music by Alex Jaffray, with songs by Gilbert Bécaud; production designer, François Chauvaud; released by Samuel Goldwyn Films.

Yella Fichte (Nina Hoss),  a sleek young businesswoman on the make, is an ardent student of that world. One of the first lessons she is taught is how to strike the “broker pose.” The technique, which her instructor says he learned from a John Grisham movie, requires that at the opportune moment during a business negotiation she lean over and whisper something in his ear.That instruction begins not long after Yella relocates from her hometown, Wittenberge  in the former East Germany, to Hanover in the former West Germany. It is a move, the film suggests,  from a comfortable semi-rural existence with roots to an ominous exurban no man’s land of glassed-in conference rooms, rental cars and anonymous business hotels. Here Yella embraces her talent as a deceitful wheeler-dealer in meetings that have the tension of high-stakes poker games.As the film begins, Yella travels back to Wittenberge from Hanover, where she has landed a job as an accountant. Immediately, she is accosted by her desperate ex-husband and former business partner, Ben (Hinnerk Schönemann), who pleads with her not to abandon him now that he is bankrupt. The morning of her return trip, he offers her a lift in his S.U.V. and drives off a bridge into the Elbe River.After a long, agonizing moment in which the only sounds are the wind in the trees and the ominous cawing of crows, Yella pulls herself to shore. Ben follows seconds later and collapses. She staggers to her feet and dashes to the station in time to catch the train.The implications of the crash resound through the rest of the film, as Yella tries to forget the past and adjust to a faster, colder world in which her guide and eventual lover, Philipp (Devid Striesow), tutors her in corporate mind games. As the process erodes her humanity, she has frightening flashbacks to the crash in which she once again hears the water guzzling, the wind blowing and the crows crying.Philipp, who bears an unsettling resemblance to Ben — and, like Ben, can fly into a rage at a second’s notice —  works for a venture capitalist as a negotiator. He also has his own secret investment scheme for striking it rich.Yella teams up with him only after discovering that the job she was hired to fill no longer exists and that her boss-to-be, who doesn’t remember her, has been fired for financial chicanery. Philipp happens to be staying in the same hotel and hires her for a freelance accounting job. Soon they become partners and then lovers, moving from one negotiation to the next like natural-born killers wielding computers and cellphones.  Complicating their journey is the reappearance of Ben, who continues to stalk Yella.As the movie, which was inspired by the 1962 film “Carnival of Souls,” becomes increasingly abstract, the geography and the characters acquire a deeper symbolism.  The Elbe, part of the former dividing line between East and West Germany, may be the border between the material and immaterial worlds. But which is which? Once Ben reappears, he suggests Philipp’s phantom doppelgänger. Or is it the other way around? “Yella” is the kind of movie that tantalizes the mind with possibilities without solving the puzzle.Through it all, Ms. Hoss exudes a cool, slightly eerie magnetism. As Yella tries to gain the world, her soul slips away.YELLAOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written (in German, with English subtitles) and directed by Christian Petzold; director of photography, Hans Fromm; edited by Bettina Böhler; produced by Florian Koerner von Gustorf and Michael Weber; released by Cinema Guild.

125,2008-06-13,The Happening,"Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez","USA, India",M. Night Shyamalan,"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","English, French",34.0,91.0,M. Night Shyamalan,2008,5.0,180780.0,18.0,2017-11-02 04:18:07,MANOHLA DARGIS,Something Lethal Lurks in the Rustling Trees,"The knives had been out and sharpened long before M. Night Shyamalan’s latest movie, “The Happening,” opened on Friday. A fine craftsman with aspirations to the canon, this would-be auteur has, in the last few years, experienced a sensational fall from critical and commercial grace, partly through his own doing — by making bad movies and then, even after those movies failed, by continuing to feed his ego publicly — and partly through the entertainment media that, once they  smell weakness, will always bite the hand they  once slathered in drool.The signal-to-noise ratio has become so lopsided when it comes to Mr. Shyamalan that “The Happening” was marked for failure even before it had a chance to fail — or succeed. Its worth as a cultural and aesthetic object had been rendered moot, never mind that it turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense and a solid lead performance from Mark Wahlberg. Much like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix in “Signs,” which this film resembles in mood, effectiveness and flaws, Mr. Wahlberg fits into the Shyamalan universe comfortably. He rides the spooky stuff with as much ease as he does the jokes, the manufactured sincerity and cornball messages.I won’t say too much about the gimmick that Mr. Shyamalan has come up with this time around, only that it’s funny, dark and weird and involves some nasty payback from the natural world. The story opens on a bustlingly bright New York day with two women sharing a bench in Central Park. One hears something, the other doesn’t, and before you know it, one benchwarmer has slipped a hair stick out of her do and into her own neck. The blood continues to trickle, but soon runs into the streets as men and women across the city commit similarly inexplicable acts of self-annihilation, with bullets to the head or, in a queasy, presumably intentional visual echo of Sept. 11, plunges from on high.This is the first R-rated feature from Mr. Shyamalan, who’s left the PG-13 world behind presumably to entice that much-coveted demographic, the young male bloodsucker. Going graphic has neither hurt nor harmed him, though from all the inventive ways he’s found to do away with characters, it’s hard not to wonder if he’s not extracting symbolic revenge on the fickle moviegoing public. Whatever the case, the opening’s body count works to his foundational purposes, creating an uneasy, unsettled atmosphere. Mr. Shyamalan’s words consistently fail him, as they have in the past. But working again with the cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (a longtime shooter for Jonathan Demme), he creates images — bodies falling, trees rustling — that at their most potent speak louder and more eloquently than those words.As the suicides rage like the plague, Mr. Wahlberg’s Elliot, a Philadelphia high-school science teacher, heads out of town on a train with his wife, Alma (an oddly miscast, loony-looking Zooey Deschanel, working her big blue peepers like mad), and another teacher, Julian (John Leguizamo), who brings along his young daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). The train conductors soon lose contact with the outside world, forcing passengers into the Pennsylvania backwoods. This allows Mr. Shyamalan to focus on his leads (and indulge in witless marital shtick); pick up a couple of crack scene stealers (Frank Collison and Betty Buckley); and frolic in the great outdoors with zippy cameras and special effects. Something wicked this way comes though, really, they’re  already heeere.Mr. Wahlberg’s earnest, committed presence anchors the story, giving it a sense of purpose (a reason to care). Unlike Ms. Deschanel, who looks mighty surprised to be in this movie or mighty alarmed, you hang on to Mr. Wahlberg, who smoothly navigates the broad, lurching comedy (notably a wonderfully eccentric and comic monologue) as well as the pockets of dread. Mr. Shyamalan’s bag of tricks is awfully familiar — the camera races forward, the characters stand locked in place, a child’s empty swing sways in the wind, eyes widen, mouths gape — but it’s time-tested and, with the right actors, effectual. There is, after all, real pleasure to be had from watching a magician pull even a mangy rabbit out of a battered top hat.Mr. Shyamalan has come up with a doozy of a premise for “The Happening,” one that will appeal to the doomsday scenarist in every pessimist, so it’s a shame he doesn’t know what to do with it other than mow people down. One of his strengths, evident in his best film, “The Sixth Sense,” and even in misfires like “Lady in the Water,” is that he knows how to withhold enough information — goosing the quiet with well-timed boos and bangs — to keep you asking that crucial storytelling question: What happens next? But here, caught up in art-directing all this death, he forgets to set up the question from scene to scene. The movie unwinds like a series of ghastly tableaux vivants pasted together with sloppy domestic comedy.By the time the story shifts to a town where people are hanging from trees in overly neat formation, the image of mass suicides has been drained of its shock, and a human calamity is revealed to be an aesthetic choice. Something is happening, all right, but Mr. Shyamalan, who certainly appears to enjoy playing God, doesn’t seem to care much. But what is happening, exactly? Is it the end of the world, a blip on the green screen, a Chernobyl rerun, Al Gore’s worst nightmare?  Mr. Shyamalan tells us, more or less, letting the kitty out of the bag early. But here’s the thing about doomsday scenarios: They require an escape hatch or the weight of tragedy. Just knocking off the world because you’re mad at it isn’t enough.“The Happening” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Though he’s meant to be fading fast, Rollie — who has fitted a manual typewriter with fishhooks, believing the local lake fish make poetry with each nibble — mostly comes across as a novelist’s contrivance, an à la carte sampling of prickly charm, folksy paternalism and pathos. It’s the kind of character that Mr. Alda might have pulled off if he had been given a firmer hand than the one offered by Mr. Kinney. As it is, though he wrings real feeling from some of his scenes, Mr. Alda makes twinkly lethal.At least he has something to chew on. Mr. Broderick is less well nourished. Cooper is a tough nut to crack — he suffers from forgetfulness and the filmmakers’ insistence on making that forgetfulness cutesy — but he’s not remotely interesting. A professional Everyman, Mr. Broderick does what he can — like the rest of the cast, he appears to have been left to his own devices — mainly by looking completely deflated, a miscalculation for a character charged with shouldering so much narrative weight.  When Mr. Broderick stands in the middle of the frame, which is where the inelegant cinematography often situates the performers, it’s the actor who looks stranded rather than the character.“Diminished Capacity” touches earnestly on heart-heavy issues of loss: loss of memory, of love and, perhaps because of the local angle, of (or rather by) the Chicago Cubs. But Mr. Kinney, a founder of the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago and a familiar face from film and television, never gives his movie a sustained pulse. The actors look as if they’re having a reasonably fine time, but there’s no sense of commitment here, no sense that this was a movie that absolutely, passionately had to be made. As it happens, the liveliest performance is one of the briefest and comes from Mr. Baker, who goes to crazy town and back in a short, frenzied scene about an especially masochistic Cub fan. He jolts the movie awake.DIMINISHED CAPACITYOpens on Friday in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.Directed by Terry Kinney; written by Sherwood Kiraly, based on his novel; director of photography, Vanja Cernjul; edited by Tim Streeto; music by Robert Burger; production designer, Dan Davis; produced by Celine Rattray, Galt Niederhoffer, Daniela Taplin Lundberg and Tim Evans; released by IFC Films.

Maybe he was preoccupied by “Scream 4,” due out next spring.The relevant number in “Soul” is seven, which, after a labored, overly long set-up, is the quota of teenagers that a long-dead schizophrenic psycho killer is scheduled to carve up before the movie can end. Mr. Craven follows his usual recipe of comic pop-culture references and dreamy shocks, but his heart doesn’t seem to be in either. Only a few fleeting images — a victim who had been thrown into a river suddenly appearing in a restroom mirror, mutely reaching out from his watery grave; a girl being dragged down an embankment, her arms spread like an angel — have the old Craven poetry.The story is in the overly complicated vein that this genre prefers: each of the seven teenagers, born the night the killer died (or did he?), has inherited one aspect of his fractured personality. But the revelations, when they come, don’t register as either creepy or funny.One thing that does, depending on your point of view, is that the schizoid killer is played — complete with alternating voices for his good and bad sides — by the stage star Raúl Esparza. “My Soul to Take” is a long way from Sondheim, Mamet and Pinter, but perhaps Mr. Esparza was able to draw on an earlier Broadway role: Riff Raff in the “The Rocky Horror Show.” (Whether that’s creepy or funny is up to the viewer.)“My Soul to Take” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language and blood.",0,14637490.0,14744435.0,0
128,2008-07-25,Back to Normandy,"Anne Borel, Claude Hébert, Nicolas Philibert, Nicole Picard",France,Nicolas Philibert,Documentary,French,,113.0,,2007,6.4,129.0,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,JEANNETTE CATSOULIS,Returning to the Scene of a Crime Movie,"More than 30 years ago the French filmmaker Nicolas Philibert began his career as an assistant director on René Allio’s true-crime drama “I, Pierre Rivière, Having Slaughtered My Mother, My Sister and My Brother ...” Adapted from Michel Foucault’s celebrated account (based on the killer’s jailhouse confession) of a young Norman peasant who in 1835 used a billhook to commit triple murder, the movie was filmed only a few miles from the crime scene, mainly with local residents.In “Back to Normandy,” Mr. Philibert returns to the region to catch up with the cast and relive an experience that was pivotal in forging his artistic identity. But he has more in mind than an indulgence of nostalgia. As he chats with the families whose lives were briefly touched by the arcane disruptions of moviemaking, his visit yields a palimpsest of observations on work, rationality and the ineluctable connections between history and modernity.As though to emphasize this, the movie opens with the bloody birth of a piglet and the traditional, hard-to-watch cruelties — snipping, injecting, slapping — that accompany it. The animal’s frantic squeals are uncomfortably echoed in a segment of the murder scene from “I, Pierre,” one of a number of clips that serve as a bridge between the two films and the villagers’ dual roles as actors and interviewees.Structured around a series of relaxed, lighthearted conversations (most of which take place outdoors), “Back to Normandy” has a bucolic placidity that grounds the film in the lulling rhythms of country life and the daily chores of farming and animal husbandry. At times not much appears to be happening, until you realize that the director’s sidelong, subtle approach has teased out modern-day parallels to the issues that surrounded the Rivière case.Charles and Annie Lihou speak movingly of the impact of their daughter’s schizophrenia on the rest of the family (Pierre Rivière’s trial was one of the earliest examples of psychiatry’s rocky relationship with the law). Annick Bisson — who, as a 16-year-old, played the luckier of the killer’s two sisters — now works with mentally handicapped adults.Though rooted in 19th-century tragedy, “Back to Normandy” is an overwhelmingly cheerful film (the merry Borel family views its patriarch’s thespian adventure as nothing short of hilarious) that explores the frustrations of filmmaking alongside its impact on an isolated community. Admirers of “To Be and to Have,” Mr. Philibert’s delightful study of a rural schoolteacher, may find his elliptical style less engrossing this time out, but from bloody start to poignant end, “Back to Normandy” is never less than an extraordinary journey through time, memory and the repercussions of a baffling, bygone crime.BACK TO NORMANDYOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Nicolas Philibert; in French, with English subtitles; directors of photography, Katell Djian and Mr. Philibert; edited by Mr. Philibert and Thadée Bertrand; produced by Serge Lalou and Gilles Sandoz; released by Kino International.

129,2008-09-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Money Isn’t Everything When Values Are at Stake,"The suds that cascade through “Tyler Perry’s The Family That Preys” more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like “Dallas,” “Dynasty” and their offspring. As the movie proceeds, the flow quickens into a surging flood tide of recriminations and reversals in which blows are exchanged, claws bared and tears shed.Produced, written and directed by Mr. Perry, a one-man industry serving a niche audience that is primarily African-American, “The Family That Preys” doesn’t worry about how it gets from A to Z. There is no problem that a miraculous (and preposterous) plot development can’t resolve in two minutes.Most of the characters are either good or bad in this crude interracial fable about the power of greed to destroy families and erode morality. The one in-between character is Charlotte Cartwright, a wealthy Southern matriarch who runs a construction empire near Atlanta.Played with relish by Kathy Bates, Charlotte is both a ruthless business executive and a good ol’ gal. Midway through the movie she takes off on a cross-country road trip with her strait-laced best friend, Alice (Alfre Woodard), the movie’s moral grounding wire and occasional narrator, who runs a diner.While Alice watches with amused trepidation, Charlotte dances with potbellied cowboys in a country-and-western bar and throws around cash at a club featuring male strippers. Prodded by Alice, Charlotte also receives a baptismal dunk in a muddy river when the two women happen upon a roadside soul-saving ceremony.Charlotte may be rich, but she is not a greedy snob like the designated villains. One baddie is Charlotte’s son William (Cole Hauser), who schemes to wrest the business from his mother’s control. But the worst monster is Andrea (Sanaa Lathan), the older of Alice’s two daughters.Curling her lips into a sneer and turning up her nose, Andrea lords her superior education (Harvard) and income over her sister, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), who works in Alice’s diner. She also humiliates her husband, Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), a construction worker, by denying his existence in social situations and by cheating on him with William.In a movie that carefully balances its moral and racial equations, her good counterpart, Abby (Robin Givens), is equally well educated and attractive but scrupulously honest and ethically unimpeachable. Mr. Perry plays Pam’s likable husband, Ben, who works side by side with Chris.The pun of the movie’s title evokes its message. When “prey” turns to “pray,” good things are likely to happen. “Pray” means not  simply being religious but also having a grounded sense of values and a good heart that doesn’t judge people by their tax bracket.“Tyler Perry’s The Family That Preys” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references and brief violence.TYLER PERRY’S THE FAMILY THAT PREYSOpened on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Tyler Perry; director of photography, Toyomichi Kurita; edited by Maysie Hoy; music by Aaron Zigman; production designer, Ina Mayhew; produced by Mr. Perry and Reuben Cannon; released by Lionsgate.

Enter a mighty tribe of feral Chihuahuas with digital lips, who sweep Chloe away and teach her the power of saying “no más.”No más to funny little outfits! No más to sitting on laps! You are Chihuahua! Where is your bark?Chloe does indeed find her bark, which evidently has the power to make nearby architecture collapse. As for Rachel (Piper Perabo), the empty-headed dog sitter who misplaced her rich aunt’s most prized possession in the first place, she learns that it’s  O.K. to love the Mexican gardener (Manolo Cardona) as long as he’s outrageously handsome, speaks perfect English and calls himself a “landscaper.”As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, “Chihuahua” is reasonably diverting.

None of the “proof” on exhibit is convincing enough to sway the opinions of skeptics, but that isn’t really the aim of this documentary, directed by Jay Delaney, also an Ohioan. Like its subjects, “Not Your Typical Bigfoot Movie” has a modest, down-home feel: it’s not flashy or even visually pleasing, its pace is leisurely and its intent unfocused.While plenty of time is spent traveling with Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Burton on research trips and to the Chattahoochee Bigfoot Conference in Tennessee, the film’s main emphasis is on depicting the everyday lives of regular, financially struggling folk who just happen to have an unusual hobby.NOT YOUR TYPICAL BIGFOOT MOVIEOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced, directed and edited by Jay Delaney; director of photography, Shane Allen Davis; music by Justin Riley and Ben Colburn; released by Oscilloscope Pictures.

132,2008-10-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,NATHAN LEE,United by Shared Ambivalence,"In 1961, five young men with nothing better to do enlisted in the United States Army and found themselves stationed in Germany at the height of the cold war. United by their shared ambivalence and interest in music, they started jamming in G.I. bars and playing in local clubs.They caught the attention of two intellectual admen, Walther Niemann and Karl-H. Remy, who took up the band as a creative project, remaking the musicians’ image and branding them the Monks. There was a look (a tonsure hairdo, black garb, rope nooses for necklaces), a sound (driving minimalism, harsh vocals with repetitive lyrics, feedback, weird banjo), an ethos (the anti-Beatles) and eventually an album, “Black Monk Time,” that would enter rock history as one of the great underground records of the 1960s.“Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback,” an ambitious but unfocused  documentary by the filmmakers Dietmar Post and Lucía Palacios, bids to immortalize this short-lived if influential group. The case is compelling — the Monks had an amazing sound that anticipated the avant-garde pop of the Velvet Underground — and a little hysterical: one of the band’s admirers claims that the social upheavals of 1968 would have happened two years earlier if everyone had been listening to the band.MONKSThe Transatlantic FeedbackOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Dietmar Post and Lucia Palacios; directors of photography, Mr. Post and Ms. Palacios; edited by Dieter Jaufmann and K.

133,2008-11-26,Australia,"Shea Adams, Eddie Baroo, Ray Barrett, Tony Barry","UK, Australia, USA",Baz Luhrmann,"Adventure, Drama, Romance, War","English, Aboriginal, Chinese, Japanese",53.0,165.0,"Stuart Beattie (screenplay), Baz Luhrmann (screenplay), Ronald Harwood (screenplay), Richard Flanagan (screenplay), Baz Luhrmann (story)",2008,6.6,111559.0,56.0,2017-11-02 04:18:08,MANOHLA DARGIS,Oh Give Me a Home Where the Cowboys and Kangaroos Roam,"Baz Luhrmann’s continent-size epic, “Australia,” isn’t the greatest story ever — it’s several dozen of the greatest stories ever told, “The African Queen,” “Gone With the Wind” and “Once Upon a Time in the West”  included. A pastiche of genres and references wrapped up — though, more often than not, whipped up — into one demented and generally diverting horse-galloping, cattle-stampeding, camera-swooping, music-swelling, mood-altering widescreen package, this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion.Mr. Luhrmann’s use of culturally degraded forms both here and in earlier films like “Moulin Rouge” doesn’t register as either a conceptual strategy  or a cynical commercial ploy or some combination of the two, as it can with art world jesters like Jeff Koons and Takashi Murakami, who have appropriated kitsch as a (more or less) legitimate postmodern strategy. Instead it feels — feeling being paramount in all of Mr. Luhrmann’s films — like a sincere cry from the swelling, throbbing heart, a true expression of self. And while that self and its gaudy work may be stitched together from the bits and pieces of pop culture — the son of a movie-theater owner, Mr. Luhrmann grew up worshiping at the altar of Hollywood — they are also wholly sincere.Sincere, if also sometimes confused and confusing: though there is no denying the scope and towering ambition of “Australia,” which was largely shot on location in the outback,  it can be difficult to gauge Mr. Luhrmann’s intentions, or rather his level of self-awareness. The film begins with some text that scrolls importantly across the screen, immediately setting the uncertain tone with some (serious?) twaddle about Australia as a land of “adventure and romance.” Before you have a chance to harrumph indignantly about the oppression of the Aborigines (or sneer at the country’s early imported criminal population), the text has skipped to the topic of “the stolen generations,” the children of indigenous peoples who, from the 19th century well into the 20th, were forcibly separated from their cultures by white Australians in the name of God and civilization.But no worries! Though “Australia” is narrated by a young boy of mixed race, Nullah (the newcomer Brandon Walters), the illegitimate son of an Aboriginal mother and a white father, who is trying to escape the authorities, and while it opens in 1939, shortly before World War II blasted Australian shores,  the film isn’t a bummer. Like every other weighty or would-be weighty moment that passes through Mr. Luhrmann’s  soft-filtering lens — a man being trampled to death by rampaging cattle or a city being annihilated by bombing Japanese warplanes — the calamities of history are merely colorful grist for his main interest, the romance between a wilted English rose, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), and an itinerant Australian cattleman, the Drover (Hugh Jackman).The lady and the tramp meet soon after she lands in Australia to track down her cattleman husband, whose early murder sets all the narrative pieces in place. Initially intent on selling her property, including 1,500 head of cattle, Sarah soon transforms into a frontierswoman, seduced by Nullah’s smile and the majestic valleys and peaks of both the land and of the Drover’s musculature. Although Ms. Kidman and Mr. Jackman are initially riffing on Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart’s prickly courtship in “The African Queen” — later, as they heat up, they slip into a sexier Scarlett-and-Rhett dynamic — only Ms. Kidman really embraces the more comic and potentially embarrassing aspects of her role, giving herself over to Mr. Luhrmann and his occasionally cruel camera with a pronounced lack of vanity.Though looking bad (or at least less than perfect) on camera is a particular form of vanity for actors, Ms. Kidman has in recent years generally erred on the side of physical perfection, sometimes to the detriment of her performances. But she’s wonderfully and fully expressive here, from wince-worthy start to heartbreaking finish, whether she’s wrinkling her nose in mock disgust or rushing across a dusty field, her arms pumping so wildly that it’s a wonder well water doesn’t spring from her mouth. It’s a ludicrous role — not long after priming her pump,  the barren widow turns into a veritable fertility goddess — but she rides Sarah’s and the story’s ups and downs  with ease. Mr. Jackman gives the movie oomph; Ms. Kidman gives it a  performance.More than anything else in the film, Nullah included, Ms. Kidman tethers “Australia” to the world of human feeling and brings Mr. Luhrmann’s outrageous flights of fancy down to earth. That may not be where he prefers to make movies, but it’s a necessary place for even a fantasist to visit. Although many of his Western contemporaries like to root around in down-and-dirty realism, Mr. Luhrmann maintains a full-throttle commitment to cinematic illusion and what he characterizes as the “heightened artifice” of his so-called Red Curtain trilogy, “Strictly Ballroom,” “William Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet” and “Moulin Rouge.” You may not always see the people for the production design in these, but when you do — as in “Romeo + Juliet” and sometimes here — they spring forth from their fantastical milieus like  fists.A maximalist, Mr. Luhrmann doesn’t simply want to rouse your laughter and tears: he wants to rouse you out of a sensory-overloaded stupor with jolts of passion and fabulous visions. That may make him sound a wee bit Brechtian,    but he’s really just an old-fashioned movie man, the kind who never lets good taste get in the way of rip-roaring entertainment. The usual line about kitsch is that it’s an affront, a cheapening of the culture, a danger. “Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession,” Milan Kundera wrote. “The first tear says: How nice to see children running on the grass! The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass! It is the second tear that makes kitsch kitsch.”True, but it doesn’t make  the   second tear any less wet.“Australia” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The technical exuberance is almost always impressive, but it’s starting to seem like its own cliché.How refreshing, then, to settle into “Rab Ne Bana di Jodi” (“A Match Made by God”), a love story   that has a different pace and feel than the recent crop of action thrillers. “Rab,” which reteams the director Aditya Chopra and Shahrukh Khan, Bollywood’s reigning superstar, is “soft, sweet and slow,” in the words of one of its songs. It deftly blends comedy,  the ruling tone of the new Bollywood, with melodrama, the ruling tone of the old.Mr. Khan sports glasses and a cheesy little mustache as Surinder Sahni, a shy self-described geek who works for Punjab Power in Amritsar. Surinder is gaga for his wife, Taani (the newcomer Anushka Sharma), who, because of various tragedies in the film’s first few minutes, may have lost the ability to love or be happy.To win Taani’s heart — or just to see her smile — Surinder gets an extreme makeover and disguises himself as Raj, a swaggering goofball who favors tight jeans and T-shirts with slogans like “Bad Boy.” Raj becomes Taani’s partner in a dance competition (“First time in Amritsar!”), and boy meets girl all over again.Mr. Chopra’s 1995 film, “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” starring Mr. Khan, remains a touchstone of contemporary  Bollywood, and the two do excellent work again here.   The Surinder/Raj dual role seems tailor-made (probably was) for Mr. Khan, who gets to show off his twin talents: he suffers nobly and entertains with panache. And Mr. Chopra demonstrates how a director can master technology without being mastered by it. For him, storytelling comes first. (The plot has its flaws, but they’re not deadly.)“Rab” is suffused with God talk and movie talk; religion and films are how the characters learn lessons about life and love. The best and most joyous sequence here is a song-and-dance number that pays witty tribute to Bollywood and Hollywood styles through the decades. It’s a lesson that goes down easy.RAB NE BANA DI JODIOpened on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Aditya Chopra; director of photography, Ravi K.

After all, the choreographed fighting is dancing by another name, and plays off the same desire to see movie-star bodies in motion.“Chandni Chowk,” the first Bollywood movie to be financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, starts too frantically but settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday-matinee picture. The affable Akshay Kumar, fresh from the runaway hit “Singh Is Kinng,” stars as Sidhu, a vegetable cutter in the Chandni Chowk marketplace in Delhi, who dreams of being something more. Sidhu, an all-Indian boy and a bumbler whose clumsiness gets him in and out of trouble, travels to China, where he’s mistakenly thought to be an incarnation of a great fighter come to save a village from the evil Hojo (Gordon Liu). Hojo’s best trick? Slicing off heads with the edge of his boomerang bowler hat. (That’s just one homage — to Oddjob in “Goldfinger” — in a film crammed with movie references.)The plot has long-separated twins (one is named Meow Meow) and long-lost fathers, a potato with the face of the god Ganesh, an interpreter called Chopstick and, most intriguingly, Asia’s two superpowers meeting in the arena of pop culture. The explicit message for the Indian hero is know yourself and be self-reliant, and you will triumph. Sidhu’s best trick? A kung fu move derived from his years of cutting vegetables.In a film impressed with Chinese gadgetry — including a pair of leg cuffs that help the dance-challenged — and with scenes set in the sleek urban landscape of Shanghai, it’s hard not to see a broader point: India, don’t be afraid of China’s accomplishments.

The pope has just had a priceless ruby ring snatched off his finger by a thief who has already stolen the Magna Carta, the Japanese imperial sword and the Shroud of Turin. (Somewhere along the line the Pink Panther diamond, a symbol of France, is also pilfered once again.)As a so-called dream team of investigators from Britain (Alfred Molina), Japan (Yuki Matsuzaki) and Italy (Andy Garcia) question the pope, Clouseau rummages through a closet stuffed with papal vestments, impulsively tries one on and rushes to the balcony overlooking St. Peter’s Square. Leaning forward to bestow a blessing, he loses his footing,  tumbles head first from the balcony and clings to a flagpole, robes flapping along with his arms and legs.Such hoary slapstick routines, invariably rushed, are all there is in “The Pink Panther 2,” a movie whose remaining cast list — John Cleese (replacing Kevin Kline from the first installment), Lily Tomlin, Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, the Bollywood beauty Aishwarya Rai Bachchan —  suggests something a little more refined than this hodgepodge of juvenile pranks.Ms. Tomlin’s character, Mrs. Berenger, a spinoff of her Tasteful Lady, represents the movie’s only attempt to be a comedy of manners. A police instructor on etiquette, she tutors Clouseau, whose every third sentence is a sexist or racist slur — as when she overhears him saying to his Japanese colleague, “I suppose you will be wanting sushi, my little yellow friend” —  on politically correct speech.It is tempting to think of the revived franchise as the sort of misbegotten renovation that can take place when an architectural landmark, say, the original Pennsylvania Station, is replaced by a banal, anonymous structure. The original “Pink Panther” movies, I should hasten to add, were hardly landmarks. Respectable comedies with a modicum of sophistication, they were anchored by the presence of  Peter Sellers, a comic genius whose every tic suggested an upheaval of subversive mischief.As much as I admire Mr. Martin’s cooler brand of comedy, his Clouseau lacks the demonic glee Mr. Sellers put into a character who seemed to originate from the inside out. Mr. Martin’s Clouseau is a skillful gloss right down to the phony French accent, which lacks the layers of oratorical pretension Mr. Sellers put into it. Why is it, I wonder, that any number of actors can play James Bond, while Clouseau now and forever belongs to Mr. Sellers?Although the stunts come thick and fast in “The Pink Panther 2,” they are jammed together in a way that gives most of them barely enough time to register. The director Harald Zwart, taking over from Shawn Levy, has so little trust in his routines and in the audience’s attention span that none is allowed to develop into a belly-laughing classic.In no particular order these are some of those gags: Clouseau accidentally burns down the same restaurant twice. Posing as a flamenco dancer, he tramples on his partner’s feet. While ineptly sleuthing around in the mansion of a suspect (Jeremy Irons), he is unknowingly captured on surveillance cameras and ends up falling down a chimney. Exploring a rack of expensive wines in a snooty restaurant, he nearly tips it over, and the bottles sliding from their niches become pins in a mammoth juggling exhibition. He bungles at karate with the sons of his sidekick Ponton (Jean Reno). He goes haywire with a fire extinguisher.Mr. Martin works hard to get the few laughs he can from such strenuous business. He seems to be having a reasonably good time. But this is the stuff of the Three Stooges. That’s all well and good if you know what not to expect.“The Pink Panther 2” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

(before the whole coma thing), and Tucker (Mr. Moore), a hound dog who runs the gamut of emotions from goofy to goofier.Mr. Cregger and Mr. Moore understand the ABC’s of comic opposites and comedy plotting. After Eugene wakes from his coma, Tucker springs him from the hospital for a road trip. Destination: the Playboy Mansion. (Hugh Hefner plays himself, dispensing this nugget of advice to Tucker: You don’t need to find a bunny; find the bunny that’s in every girl.) And the ending neatly ties up all the plotlines.The problem with “Miss March” is that it isn’t very funny. There’s much spraying liquid, predictable excrement, a smutty rapper, an epileptic girl and, of course, beautiful lesbians making out. Mostly it all feels tame, right down to the film’s softhearted message of true love. Mr. Moore lacks the acting chops to turn Tucker into the force of anarchic mayhem that the movie needs him to be. Instead he’s just annoying. (Mr. Cregger fares better in the straight-man role.)And the best line wasn’t in the movie. A young man sitting behind me asked his friend to guess Mr. Hefner’s IQ. (It’s a big number.)

138,2008-08-08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,RACHEL SALTZ,An Action Comedy With a Little Song and Dance,"This hyped-up action comedy, which bounces from Punjab to Egypt to Australia, broke box-office records when it opened in India last week. Its appeal has everything to do with its star, Akshay Kumar, who plays Happy Singh, a bumbling villager (“I’m an illiterate fool!” he says at one point), sent off into the world with nothing but his good intentions.“Singh Is Kinng” isn’t a great movie. There are too many sloppy action sequences, the humor’s too broad, the storytelling lackluster. But the immensely likable Mr. Kumar shines as a Capraesque hero who spreads bedrock Indian values — honor your mother, help the poor — by example, most conspicuously as the accidental leader of a feared crime gang in Australia.Happy and the gang are Sikhs, but, as a disclaimer states, “This is not a religious film.” It’s a Bollywood film, and that means  visions of communal harmony, untiring exuberance and, of course, song-and-dance numbers. One takes place amid Egyptian ruins, with miniskirted dancers no less.And at the end there’s a remix of the title song, featuring Snoop Dogg hanging out with Mr. Kumar and rapping (“Watch me zoom by, make it boom by/Whaddup to all the ladies hanging out in  Mumbai”).

Two men in bed: “I love you.” “What’s my name?” Pause. “I am so in love with you.”Thin woman to big woman: “I’d go to lunch with him.” “You don’t eat.” “I could learn.”If you’re paying attention, you won’t be able to ignore the scattershot plotting, the synthetic emotions, the highly variable quality of the acting and the woodenness of Jesse Archer’s script when it isn’t dealing in one-liners. Fortunately, it’s about 50 percent one-liners.Mindy Cohn — you might remember her as Natalie from “The Facts of Life” — is likable as Violet, the profane yet rueful center of gravity among a group of younger gay men who are not inclined to share her.The film is about Violet’s decision to get on with her life and find a straight partner, and it’s refreshing to see a story in which the gay men, and not the pathetic, lonely woman, are thrown into separation panic.Believing it, however, requires suspending an awful lot of disbelief — even in the context of a smutty sitcom — and the inevitable happy ending is sheer unearned fantasy.VIOLET TENDENCIESOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Casper Andreas; written by Jesse Archer; director of photography, Tim Naylor; edited by Craig Cobb; music by Michael Barry; production design by Lee Clayton; costumes by Moni Briones and Beth Edwards; produced by Mr. Andreas and Mr. Archer; released by Embrem Entertainment.

The worlds in question could be a number of things — heaven and hell, peace and war, past and present; but  in a film this vivid and this oblique, the cumulative thrust of the images is what pulls us through.Offering almost nothing in the way of exposition, the Sri Lankan filmmaker Vimukthi Jayasundara drops a man from the sky and trusts we will follow him. This beautiful fallen angel (Thusitha Laknath) makes his way to a town where rioters are trashing an electronics store, attaches himself briefly to a terrified Chinese girl (Huang Lu) and traverses a bewitching rural landscape empty of adult men. Along the road, people seem to be expecting him: “Why did you come so early?” asks one old lady, and the embraces of his brother’s wife suggest she has reached a limit of loneliness.Like Mr. Jayasundara’s  2005 feature, “The Forsaken Land,” “Between Two Worlds” is deeply embedded in Sri Lanka’s devastating civil war and the societal fissures that have resulted. Elements of folklore, myth and political symbolism speckle the story (in one scene a man in a Mickey Mouse mask is mercilessly beaten in the middle of a street strewn with smashed television sets), and marauding rebels prowl on the margins.A bass note of blood and toxicity — adultery and rape, dead cows and poisoned water — drives the film’s stirring score (by Lakshman Joseph de Saram) and pulses beneath its lush canopy of trees. In this land, part dream and part nightmare, the scythed bodies of men in the undergrowth tell their own tale.BETWEEN TWO WORLDSOpens on Monday  in Manhattan.Written and directed by Vimukthi Jayasundara; director of photography, Channa Deshapriya; edited by Gisèle Rapp-Meichler; music by Lakshman Joseph de Saram; art direction  by Lal Harendranath; produced by Michel Klein and Philippe Avril;  released by Artscope.

141,2011-02-11,The Company Men,"Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones, Chris Cooper, Suzanne Rico",USA,John Wells,Drama,English,69.0,104.0,John Wells,2010,6.8,40198.0,67.0,2017-11-02 04:18:12,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Perils of the Corporate Ladder: It Hurts When You Fall,"“The Company Men” puts us down on the ground after having been up in the air. The movie powerfully revisits a theme touched on last year in the bitter comic drama “Up in the Air”: the devastating impact of sudden downsizing on corporate executives who have lived by the treacherous adage “You are what you do.” Instead of regarding these unfortunate men from the lofty perspective of a charming, cynical hatchet man logging frequent-flier miles — George Clooney’s character in “Up in the Air” — “The Company Men” looks them straight in the eye from inside the trenches.Riding on the strong performances of Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper, portraying mid- to high-level employees at the fictional Boston company GTX, the movie is realistic enough to make all corporate climbers, but especially men over 50, quake in their boots. If you are what you do, what are you if you’re no longer doing it?As depicted in the film the modern corporation is a sterile Darwinian shark tank in which the only thing that matters is the bottom line. The old days of corporate beneficence and loyalty to longtime employees are long gone.The film is the first feature written and directed by John Wells, an executive producer and show runner for “ER.” If it has the compactness and structure of a high-end television drama, there are signs that it was severely edited. A tantalizing subplot about one character’s extramarital affair with a fellow executive has been all but abandoned. We meet the families of the three male principals, but only one wife and one child emerge as more than background figures.Some of the details are wrong. Even with an annual salary of $160,000, Mr. Affleck’s character, the 37-year-old Bobby Walker, could never have afforded the suburban mansion in which he lives with his wife, Maggie (a spunky Rosemarie DeWitt), and two children. A 12-year veteran of GTX, Bobby is suddenly fired, not for incompetence but to cut costs on the eve of a probable merger.Yet the minor miscalculations pale beside the film’s unflinching depiction of the perils of heedless upward mobility that, for all the luxuries it affords, looks pretty grim. I remember reading about the lavish but regimented lives of Lehman Brothers’ upper echelon and thinking that this must be hell.If Bobby is too cocky for his own good, and Mr. Jones’s character, Gene McClary, too honest, there is no question about their fundamental integrity and steady job performances. What matters at GTX is not the quality of work but keeping the stock price afloat, partly to justify the $22 million salary of a chief executive who views the thousands of ruined lives of former employees as worth the short-term uptick.This cold, flinty-eyed chief executive, James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), is the film’s closest thing to a villain. He has also been Gene’s best friend since they founded the business. The film’s ugliest message is that friendship nowadays means nothing in the workplace if it impedes profit. That Gene is a man of conscience who vociferously argues against downsizing makes his severance all the more coldblooded.The movie crisscrosses among Bobby, Gene and Phil Woodward (Mr. Cooper), a 30-year employee and friend of Gene’s who is pushing 60 after having worked his way up from the factory floor to an executive suite. Phil is advised to dye his gray hair and to tweak his résumé to omit any work reference before 1990. Mr. Cooper gives a great, tragic performance of a man who lashes out like a trapped snake when he realizes that, in his words, “my life ended, and nobody noticed.”Bobby has to give up his Porsche and his golf club membership, sell his house and move his family into his parents’ home. He eventually takes work in the small, struggling construction business run by his brother-in-law Jack Dolan (Kevin Costner). He also attends humiliating outplacement seminars at which the unemployed are instructed to recite slogans like “I will win” and “Faith, courage, enthusiasm.”With its acutely observant eye for class differences and chilly corporate manners “The Company Men” has two moral grounding wires. Jack, who hires Bobby despite Bobby’s dislike of him and his sloppy carpentry, does the honorable family thing. The movie risks sentimentality by arguing that the satisfaction of building things with your hands might be more rewarding than earning a pile by deal making and paper pushing. But Mr. Costner’s grumpy, taciturn Jack keeps the movie’s bleeding-heart tendencies in check.In a movie that’s carefully structured to balance the anguish with some hope, the main voice of decency and humanity belongs to Gene. Visiting the empty dockyard where the business began as a shipbuilding operation, he muses eloquently about the days when people made things they took satisfaction in creating. With his sad, crinkled eyes in a craggy face whose expression runs from sorrowful to bitter, Gene embodies the rugged can-do American spirit near the end of its tether but still undefeated.“The Company Men” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains considerable profanity.THE COMPANY MENOpens on Friday  nationwide.Written and directed by John Wells; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Robert Frazen; produced by Mr. Wells, Claire Rudnick Polstein and Paula Weinstein; released by the Weinstein Company.

But that isn’t enough.The story centers on a couple in their 30s, Neil (Todd Grinnell) and Sarah (Ali Hillis), who are worried that the spark and sense of adventure have gone out of their marriage. “What I really want is to have a torrid, passionate affair with the woman who my wife was five years ago,” Neil laments to a friend named Graham (Kevin Linehan).Graham, conveniently, is a divorce lawyer and thus can voice the theme of the movie. “Divorce is rampant; everybody’s doing it,” he says, adding: “The baby boomers were hippies, then they got jobs and became yuppies. That’s kind of what the Gen-Xers are doing now.”Got it; now let’s have that fresh, Gen-X take on this tired conceit. Alas, John Chuldenko, who wrote and directed, doesn’t really have one. Neil and Sarah break into the apartment they shared when they were first starting out, and re-energizing and complications ensue. But aging Gen-Xers, it turns out, aren’t all that witty, and Ms. Hillis and Mr. Grinnell don’t have the kind of chemistry that might make this setup work.“Nesting” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and a night of excessive drinking.",0,,,0

The images, styled after Miroslav Sasek’s illustrations, still charm, and the movies’ returning directors, Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, keep their machine humming. A third director, Conrad Vernon, has joined them, perhaps to accommodate the heightened pyrotechnics.The principals (Ben Stiller voicing Alex the leader lion; Chris Rock as Marty the effusive zebra; Jada Pinkett Smith as the ungainly Gloria the hippo; and David Schwimmer as the neurotic Melman the giraffe) also cruise comfortably, benefiting from their usual solid and abundant support, including the quasi-military penguin squad (stars of their own TV series) and Sacha Baron Cohen as the lemur King Julien.The story — the four join a European circus to escape a predatory French animal-control official (a delightful Frances McDormand) literally after Alex’s head — has them leaving Africa for Monaco, the Swiss Alps, Rome, London and New York. And meeting a gruff tiger, Vitaly (Bryan Cranston); a spry jaguar, Gia (Jessica Chastain); and a garrulous sea lion, Stefano (Martin Short). Alex flirts with Gia, while Julien romances Sonya, a bear. (Gloria and Melman hooked up in “M2.”) Life lessons in the script (partly by Noah Baumbach, Mr. Stiller’s “Greenberg” director) are desultory, but a late twist is surprising.Where “Madagascar 3” soars is in its visuals: A Monte Carlo chase is vertiginously madcap; a Cirque du Soleil-style spectacle dazzles with rich pastels; the 3-D effects have wit and invention.

Way back then you were played by the cute boy-man Tobey Maguire, and the girl with the fatal-beauty smile was given sweet life by Kirsten Dunst. Now, in “The Amazing Spider-Man,” you’re played by the cute boy-man Andrew Garfield, whose elongated limbs and pencil neck go a ways to make him look like the geek next door. The lovely young miss, meanwhile, is Emma Stone, whose pillowy lips serve as flotation devices that — along with her natural appeal and Mr. Garfield’s likability — keep this resuscitated studio product from fully capsizing.The director, Marc Webb, does his part. Like his debut feature, the bittersweet romance “(500) Days of Summer,” Mr. Webb’s Spider-Man movie works only because he keeps the whole package, at least until the requisite final blowout, tethered to his two appealing leads. Both look too old for high school (Mr. Garfield turns 29 in August, and Ms. Stone hits the big 24 in November), but then so did the characters introduced by the pen-and-ink legends Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962. If the readers who embraced the square-looking Peter Parker didn’t mind, maybe it was partly because this awkward outsider spoke to his times, having been bitten by a radioactive spider the same year the United States conducted 36 atmospheric nuclear weapon tests over the Pacific.The latest post-atomic-age Spider-Man has been updated with a skateboard and a hoodie, but it’s unclear whom he speaks to (beyond Sony’s shareholders), and for what reason. Like the 2002 “Spider-Man,” the first of three movies directed by Sam Raimi, “The Amazing Spider-Man” revisits Peter Parker’s origin story. This time it opens with the child Peter and his parents, Richard and Mary (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz), who, after a break-in at their house endangering Dad’s scientific secrets, rush over to Richard’s brother and sister-in-law, a k a Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Martin Sheen and Sally Field, a cozy fit). Parking the boy there for safekeeping, the parents weep and hug goodbye — “Be good,” the father portentously tells the son — and within seconds the older, now orphaned Peter is shrinking around school while eyeing his crush, Gwen Stacy (Ms. Stone).You know the rest: Peter visits a lab (this time a bioengineering outfit, Oscorp), where, along comes a spider, and so on. Suddenly he isn’t in Kansas anymore, or rather, the poignantly vulnerable human form he came in with: He’s faster, stronger, stickier. His hands and feet adhere to everything he touches, though, inexplicably, this tackiness soon subsides. For a few scenes, however, this helps give the movie a lift because Peter, in hormonally challenged adolescent fashion, is taken aback by his scarily, fantastically changing body. When he’s bothered by some toughs on the subway, he jumps up so abruptly he lands on the roof upside down, surprising himself as much as the baddies, who give futile chase while he scrambles up, up and away.Mr. Webb, wisely leaning on physical stunts and not just computer-generated imagery, exploits Peter’s metamorphosis for a few diverting, palpable sequences, including an extended scene in a desolate warehouse where, alone with his skateboard, he soars high, higher, highest. He also smashes an alarm clock on waking, accidentally snaps door handles off and snatches a fly live out of the air, a buzzy encounter that amusingly brings to mind Norman Bates. It’s too bad that Mr. Webb didn’t make more of Mr. Garfield’s reedy, bobbing-neck resemblance to Anthony Perkins. Like that psycho Norman, who says he wouldn’t hurt a fly, Peter is a divided soul (if nicer), but like Mr. Raimi’s bug boy, it takes him time to figure out who he is physically, metaphysically, existentially.To be precise, it takes an increasingly dull, drawn-out 136 minutes to work through a story that many moviegoers older than 10 may think they’ve seen because they probably did when the first movie burned up the box office. Some of the characters have changed — here it’s the blond Gwen instead of the redheaded Mary Jane, the green Lizard instead of the Green Goblin, the supercilious Captain Stacy instead of the supersilly newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson — as has the balance between the blue and red on Spidey’s suit. Mr. Webb has given the story intimacy, scaling down a lot of action and handing over screen time to Peter and Gwen’s his-and-her charm. Yet despite this and the snazzier special effects, so much looks, sounds, feels the same, even in Imax and 3-D.Mr. Garfield and Ms. Stone are by far the movie’s greatest assets and when they’re together on screen, they add warmth and a believable closeness to the industrial mix. (Ms. Field, wearing hippie hair and her trademark indulging smile, also helps keep her scenes real.) Mr. Garfield, who played Eduardo Saverin, Mark Zuckerberg’s aggrieved roommate, in “The Social Network,” comfortably slips into the dual role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man without reinventing either. He’s one of those professionally sensitive young types with a catch in his voice and moony eyes, and has had trouble holding the screen or your interest. Here, though, he responds to Mr. Webb’s close attentions — the director repeatedly pulls off Spider-Man’s mask to show off those puppy eyes — and to Ms. Stone’s generosity as a performer.All that said, unlike Christopher Nolan’s “Batman Begins,” which reconceptualized the big-screen franchise, ushering it into the noirish reaches familiar from both the initial comic book and Frank Miller’s 1980s “Dark Knight” redo, this “Spider-Man” feels like one of those unnecessary software versions, more Spider-Man 1.5 than Spider-Man reborn. Mr. Webb either didn’t have a vision for a new — nicer or nastier, stranger or more perverse — Spider-Man, or he and the writers (James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves) weren’t allowed to take true imaginative flight at a company that’s conspicuously banking on a resuscitated franchise to carry it through its next fiscal quarters. Spider-Man’s ethos remains — With great power comes great responsibility — but these days you can’t see his superhero heart and soul for his branding.“The Amazing Spider-Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Even so, when you consider that most American horror-comedies are about as funny as rotting flesh, this small sleeper delivers a surprising number of pleasingly putrid punch lines.When Bart (David Anders), a good-hearted soldier killed in Iraq, is unable to remain deceased, he turns for help to his best buddy, Joey (Chris Wylde). Joey of course turns to Google, deducing that Bart will require regular infusions of human blood to remain animate. Refusing to kill the innocent, the pair turn vigilante, preying on a selection of violent Los Angeles lowlifes with increasing skill and decreasing reluctance.Though in need of a more ruthless editor than the intriguingly named Walter Montague Urch, Mr. Prior mines ghoulish humor in refreshingly novel ways. “I’m kind of decomposing,” Bart apologizes when friends recoil, and a series of zombie suicide attempts is, like the film’s politically chilling ending, a witty treat.Paying attention to tiny, vital details — like a newly undead Bart disgustedly snipping the undertaker’s thread from his sewn-shut lips — Mr. Prior (a former Appalachian miner with a clear talent for visual effects) constantly emphasizes Bart’s essentially unaltered decency.

Grim, gory and devoid of pleasure, kinetic or otherwise, this is the second big-screen take on the British comics series Judge Dredd, after a 1995 Sylvester Stallone vehicle best remembered for Sly’s shiny, oversize codpiece. Like that movie, this one takes place in ye olde dystopia, a neo-wild West in which the gizmos look futuristic, but everything else — the drooling cretins, generic innocents, slathering villainy and fascistic overtones — is B-movie familiar, although with 100 percent more digitally enhanced carnage.Karl Urban, his face almost completely obscured by Dredd’s mask, plays the monosyllabic hero who’s cop, judge, jury and trigger-happy executioner in one expressionless package.

Directed by the hip-hop impresario turned would-be auteur RZA (a k a Robert Diggs), of the group Wu-Tang Clan, “Iron Fists” is a sweetly sincere, lightly cheeky gloss on the film genre wuxia (“martial chivalry”) and those entertainments known for their flying swordsmen (and women), crouching tigers, hidden dragons and often fabulous hair, gowns and wirework. This is a movie as drenched in genre love as it is in the arterial spray from its hordes of sliced and diced characters.It can be hard to separate knowing neo-exploitation cinema from just plain dreck, and, really, there seems little point in doing so. Once upon a time, so-called respectable films opened in certain theaters, and the putative dross of the type churned out by the producer Samuel Z. Arkoff opened elsewhere. Those divisions between high and low are long gone, demolished by vanguard directors like Dennis Hopper and more recently by filmmaker-pasticheurs like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, who draw on exploitation cinema as enthusiastically as they do on classic Hollywood and art film. The apex of their geek fandom was Mr. Tarantino’s “Death Proof” and Mr. Rodriguez’s “Planet Terror,” which were packaged in the United States as a double feature titled “Grindhouse.”“The Man With the Iron Fists” is, like those films, the progeny of a deep cinephile passion, if rather shakier filmmaking skills. Shot in China, though as supremely artificial-looking as a Hollywood (or Hong Kong) backlot, it mostly takes place in a fictional feudal town, Jungle Village, at the juncture of King Hu and Sergio Leone, filmmakers whose shadows loom heavily over the movie. It’s here that Western name actors, notably Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu, rub elbows and clashing accents with Asian talent like Daniel Wu and Gordon Liu in a knotted story involving the usual mad grab for power and gold. Lucy Liu plays Madam Blossom, who runs a flamboyantly, amusingly smutty, pinked-up brothel packed with smiling lovelies who look like an Orientalist fantasy by way of Victoria’s Secret.In a misguided move, RZA has cast himself as the narrator and story hub, a character known, with a touch of wit, only as the Blacksmith. A hardworking soul, the Blacksmith makes weapons for the local warring clans, squirreling away his money so that he can leave town with Lady Silk (Jamie Chung). The Blacksmith’s pungent history — told in flashback and buoyed by a brief appearance from Pam Grier — could itself be spun off into a separate movie. It’s an obviously pivotal role that should have real juice. But RZA, with his sleepy eyes and an affect so laid-back it’s a wonder he can remain standing for minutes at a time, is too recessive a screen presence to make the character pop, much less hold your interest.To his credit, he has tapped some professional scene stealers, including Mr. Crowe and a diverting ByronMann as Silver Lion, a gaudy baddie with heavy-metal hair and a psycho grin. Mr. Crowe, who swans about as a rogue called Jack Knife, looks amused throughout, and it’s no wonder, since about all he has to do is bed multiple women and gut an occasional foe in a movie that can feel like a private party. Which in some ways it is: Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu appeared in Mr. Tarantino’s epic “Kill Bill,” to which RZA contributed music. Mr. Tarantino has returned the favor by lending his brand to “Iron Fists” as its “presenter.” RZA wrote the movie’s screenplay with Eli Roth, of “Hostel” franchise notoriety, who appeared as the bat-wielding American soldier in Mr. Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds.”It’s a small fanboy world, after all.“The Man With the Iron Fists” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

This film’s director, Marcus Dunstan, and the writer with whom he wrote the script, Patrick Melton, were in fact contributors to the last four “Saw” movies. And the prequel to this one, “The Collector,” by the same filmmakers, mined similar ground.The main target in that film, Arkin (Josh Stewart), returns, bloodied and broken but willing to aid in the rescue of another victim. And there’s also the serial killer, a masked menace who is equally interested in beetles, severed body parts and pools of blood. After mowing down a dance floor of revelers — he’s also efficient — with an improvised wheat harvester, he kidnaps the lone survivor, Elena (Emma Fitzpatrick), taking her to his pimped-out chamber of horrors. Here body parts are preserved, tarantulas are on display (and released, of course), and assorted contraptions are ready to ensnare.He’s a psychopath, eager to kill on a large scale. But he also tends to a menagerie of zombiefied minions who try to kill anyone who enters his lair, as a group of mercenaries learn when seeking to rescue Elena. Maybe it’s a game, maybe it’s not. The movie is as confounding as it is grisly.In “Wait Until Dark,” Audrey Hepburn’s character is a blind woman fending off drug smugglers who invade her home.

Formerly a teacher, Jean looks professorial in his dress shirt and tie as he looks for accounting work. But with no money, no wife and no prospects, all he finds is despair.That’s the starting point of “Jean Gentil,” written, directed, produced and shot by the wife-and-husband team of Laura Amelia Guzmán and Israel Cárdenas. The filmmakers do a better job of showing the Dominican Republic in transition than they do of telling Jean’s story. First we see the unwelcoming city, with its new skyscrapers, construction sites and busy traffic. And when Jean’s unhappiness drives him into the country, we see how the lush, tropical landscape — itself dotted with construction projects — can be lonely and inhospitable.Some scenes have power, but there are gaps that leave you wondering. Was Jean fired from his job with a tractor crew? And when was he hired? The filmmakers have no patience for details, either basic or telling. Their elliptical method starts to seem lazy, and Jean’s plight, a journey from bad to bad, starts to seem a stacked deck. Through it all Mr. Genty holds your attention with his sober dignity.

Actually, he teaches everyone a lot of lessons — it’s revenge of the geezer — allowing him to have his curmudgeonly cake and eat it too. Mostly, though, “Parental Guidance” is what families who are desperate to get out of the house over the holidays and need to bridge the generational divide will see after they’ve seen “Les Misérables.”It could be worse, and would be without Bette Midler or Marisa Tomei. Ms. Midler plays Diane, the saint married to Mr. Crystal’s Artie Decker. The kooky Diane is first seen, halfheartedly and fully clothed, working a stripper pole in her living room alongside her gal pals. (They seem to have brought their own.) Before Artie’s early retirement can kick in, their daughter, Alice (Ms. Tomei), phones and asks if Grandma and Grandpa can baby-sit her three children while she and her husband, Phil (Tom Everett Scott), take a trip. Diane is delighted, Artie dubious, but they pack up and descend with inappropriate gifts (Artie gives out bobblehead figures of himself), life lessons and a hands-on parenting philosophy that encompasses criminal negligence and Dr. Spock-style common sense.Written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse, and directed with snap by Andy Fickman, “Parental Guidance” hits its familiar buttons hard and often. Alice and her family live in a so-called smart house that comes with a talking computer that turns on appliances, greets the family and serves as a strained metaphor for what ails this brood. Alice and Phil have delegated, or perhaps surrendered, some of the basic chores of life to the computer, an early signal that these Apache helicopter parents have created a somewhat inauthentic life for their children. Diane and especially Artie (who’s so technologically clueless he has trouble answering a phone) respond to this newfangled alienation by plying the tots with sugar, a round of kick-the-can and the unaccustomed sound of the word “no.”Does it work? You betcha. There are smiles and tears, love and affirmations, a few funny jokes and a lot of easy sentimentality. At one point Artie and Diane sing a song, delighting the children and suggesting that more tunes would have been a nice idea here. Any time Ms. Midler is around, it’s smart to have her sing. She and Ms. Tomei are sympathetic, likable screen presences, but there isn’t much for them to do except smile indulgently at, and be upstaged by, men and children alike. And while this may nominally be a family affair, don’t be fooled for a second: this is Mr. Crystal’s show from opening to close, and he is not especially good about sharing.“Parental Guidance” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

And in “Snitch” — a grimy, realistic thriller with an agenda — he is simply too large for the role of John Matthews, the owner of a construction company somewhere in the heartland. When his nerdy 18-year-old son, Jason (Rafi Gavron), is sentenced to 10 years in prison after naïvely receiving a shipment of Ecstasy, John is outraged and decides to do whatever it takes to reduce the sentence. That means entering into an unholy agreement with the United States attorney and infiltrating the drug world as an informant. The movie, directed by Ric Roman Waugh from a screenplay he wrote with Justin Haythe (“Revolutionary Road”), is loosely inspired by events recounted in a 1999 broadcast (also titled “Snitch”) of the PBS series “Frontline.” It argues forcefully against the severity of laws that mandate a lengthy sentence for receiving a package of drugs, even unwittingly. Mr. Waugh’s 2008 film, “Felon,” was also a frightening nightmare about unjust incarceration in which the head of a construction crew lands in a federal penitentiary after accidentally killing a burglar on his property. He finds himself in a roiling hell where inmates engage in lethal combat in the prison yard.In “Snitch” Jason is first seen chatting with a friend via Skype. He is framed by that friend, who has made a deal with federal authorities. Unaware of the consequences, Jason agrees to hold a package of drugs. Within minutes, federal agents swoop down on the Matthews house, and he is arrested.The authorities, promising a lighter sentence if he cooperates, insist that Jason trick someone else in the same way in exchange for only 2 years behind bars instead of 10. He refuses and lands in prison, where he is assaulted. Susan Sarandon plays the hard-boiled, politically ambitious United States attorney with whom John tries to negotiate. He gets nowhere until offering to risk his life by joining her team. His conduit to the drug world, Daniel (Jon Bernthal), is an employee of his construction company and an ex-convict who has gone straight and is raising a family. John bribes the reluctant Daniel to set up an introduction to his former dealer (Michael K. Williams), and from that moment Daniel’s self-esteem begins to crumble. After some tense negotiations, John agrees to transport drug shipments in his company’s trucks, but the deal nearly falls apart in a last-minute ambush by a rival gang. And so the fun begins.By fun, I mean the visceral kicks of well-staged shootouts and highway chases as the kingpin of a drug cartel (Benjamin Bratt) enters the fray. By this point, “Snitch” has lost some of its dramatic balance and morphed into an uneasy hybrid of issue-oriented drama and action-adventure blowout. For all its violence and road rage, “Snitch” doesn’t disintegrate into noisy popcorn nonsense. It keeps a shaky finger on the domestic turmoil caused by the decisions of John and Daniel. And the performances of Ms. Sarandon and Barry Pepper, as her right-hand man, help sustain a ground-level realism that finally prevents “Snitch” from lurching off the highway. But Mr. Johnson’s screen presence, however charismatic, is out of sync with the rest of the movie. Although he projects an anguished sincerity in the father-son scenes, he lacks in his performance the nuance that defines an ordinary mortal. “Snitch” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for drugs and violence.",0,42908315.0,42930462.0,0

The score will consist of existing rock songs.At various moments this endearing but sudsy movie, which spills all over the place, evokes “High School Musical,” “Glee” and “Billy Elliot.” But unlike them, it feels less like a corporate product than like an earnest, eccentric expression of its creators’ nostalgia for the twilight of a musical lotus land before the Sex Pistols and the Clash changed everything. The closest thing to a rock god is David Bowie, whose “Life on Mars?” stands as the unofficial theme song of “The Tempest.”Vivienne is the most progressive voice at a hidebound institution whose prim archvillain, Miss Valentine (Haydn Gwynne), condescendingly informs her students that she is “middle class,” and that they are “working class.” Predictably, the loutish physical education teacher, Mr. Cafferty (Steve Speirs), is also contemptuous of artistic expression. But Vivienne has an ally in the school’s headmaster (Bob Pugh), who bravely assumes the role of Prospero after a student drops out.The movie is an overstuffed, disorganized potpourri of rehearsals and student melodramas anchored in Ms. Driver’s spunky performance. Davy (Aneurin Barnard), the handsome, dreamy-eyed student who plays Ferdinand, is in love with Stella (Danielle Branch), the production’s Miranda, who won’t give him the time of day. Davy is so bereft he briefly transfers his yearnings to Vivienne, who deftly deals with his crush.Evan (Tom Harries), the blond, curly-haired boy who portrays Ariel, is questioning his sexuality and discreetly pines after Davy. The show’s Caliban, Kenny (Darren Evans), is a skinhead with a strong voice who can’t take his classmates’ teasing and drops out. The unusual use of music in “Hunky Dory” puts the movie in its own niche. The arrangements for the Hunky Dory Orchestra are sophisticated, and their tone unabashedly romantic. Ferdinand and Miranda’s love song, “Don’t Talk,” by the Beach Boys, has rarely sounded better. One of Ariel’s numbers conjuring magic is Nick Drake’s haunting “Cello Song,” beautifully crooned by Mr. Harries. Caliban’s ballad of alienation is David Crosby’s brooding “Everybody’s Been Burned.” The Electric Light Orchestra’s “Strange Magic,” “One Summer Dream” and “Livin’ Thing” are also heard and relate effectively to the Shakespeare play. After many mishaps, including a fire that nearly burns down the school, the elaborate production is finally staged outdoors. What little we see of it is charming. What could this nostalgic, softhearted pop fantasy mean to today’s young audience? Will any of its songs be remotely familiar to moviegoers born after 1980? Pop memories are short. If the world conjured by “Hunky Dory” is sweetly appealing, it has all the pertinence of a dream half-remembered from long ago.",0,14174.0,,0

GOLD,Young Man’s Wobbly Steps to Independence,"Movies about autism have come a long way since Dustin Hoffman created a sensation in “Rain Man,” playing a savant whose astounding mathematical skills made him a threat to Las Vegas casinos. Whatever its other merits, “The Story of Luke,” a slice-of-life tale of a high-functioning autistic man-child faced with enormous changes to his sheltered existence, explains early on that, no, Luke (Lou Taylor Pucci) does not have any special powers. He’s just like any 20-something trying to find his footing, only more so. (He can, however, make pancakes and 23 other meals he’s learned by watching his favorite cooking show.)When his grandmother, who raised and home-schooled him, dies, Luke must live with Uncle Paul (Cary Elwes) and his dysfunctional family. Aunt Cindy (Kristin Bauer) has little patience for him or his senile, failing grandfather, who is checked into a nursing home. Luke hopes to follow his grandfather’s advice: Find a job, then a nice girl who won’t nag and likes to travel.Mr. Pucci (“Thumbsucker,” “The Music Never Stopped”) gives a thoughtful and nuanced performance but gets few favors from the script, which puts him front and center in almost every scene. Billed as a comedy, the film, written and directed by Alonso Mayo, comes to rely too much for its laughs on Luke’s unfiltered commentary and his alarmed confusion at the animated and bad behaviors of others (notably a repellent Seth Green as his training supervisor). Still, when it works, the film serves as a modest reminder that the challenges of autism may sometimes be no more daunting or fearsome than those that face anyone in search of an independent life.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,"Adult Head Games, Focused on a Child","Henry James’s short novel “What Maisie Knew” was suggested by a friend’s casual mention of “some luckless child of a divorced couple” caught in a custody fight. In the 1890s this kind of situation was perhaps more remarkable than it is now, but James’s interest was, as always, less in the sensational aspects of the story than in the window it offered into the relational dynamics of human psychology. In our own time, divorce and its consequences seem more banal than scandalous, but James’s tale of a young girl, “rebounding from racket to racket like a tennis ball or a shuttlecock” as her parents pursue their own narcissistic ends, still has the power to trouble and to shock. In their brilliant, haunting adaptation of “What Maisie Knew,” set in 21st-century Manhattan, the directors, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, and the screenwriters, Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright, take liberties with the Master’s plot while remaining true to the “design” that he somewhat boastfully explained in his preface to the New York Edition of the book. James relayed an adult drama of marital spite, sexual jealousy, meanness and weakness entirely through the point of view of a child, who could not possibly understand everything she witnessed. “What Maisie Knew” is really, though not grammatically, a question about the character’s understanding of what the grown-ups around her are doing. The reader knows more than she does, but doesn’t always know what she knows, and the shadow that falls between our knowledge and hers is where the pathos of the matter lies. James: “I lose myself, truly, in appreciation of my theme on noting what she does by her ‘freshness’ for appearances in themselves vulgar and empty enough. They become, as she deals with them, the stuff of poetry and tragedy and art.”And now cinema, in spite of the lingering superstition that James’s writing cannot be translated into film. To play Maisie (an entirely credible name for the 6-year-old daughter of a pair of pretentious New Yorkers), the filmmakers have enlisted Onata Aprile, a wide-eyed, dark-haired pixie whose quiet watchfulness is perfect for the role. Wisely, Mr. Siegel and Mr. McGehee do not try to coax too much acting out of her. There are no displays of precocious insight or histrionic innocence. Maisie says, in every case, more or less what a child would and tries to please the wayward grown-ups around her even as she deflects their efforts to make her feelings answer their needs.Her parents are Beale (Steve Coogan), an art dealer, and Susanna (Julianne Moore), a musician. Their fights quickly and inevitably lead to a breakup, after which Maisie becomes a pawn in a bitter game. Each wants her in order to spite the other, and also as evidence of virtue. Their declarations of love are, in the moment, perfectly sincere, but also woefully inadequate.Beale, a variation on the jokey, jerky guy Mr. Coogan can play in his sleep, fills his daughter’s life with presents and promises, and then vanishes on business trips for months on end. Susanna showers Maisie with manipulative affection and then wanders off into bouts of self-pity or creative abandon. For a parent, watching these monsters has a twofold effect. On the one hand, you may be forgiven a frisson of self-righteous superiority, since whatever your own shortcomings, you are surely above such blatant acts of deceit and neglect. On the other hand, since Beale and Susanna exist on a recognizable continuum of parental behavior, you can’t help feeling implicated.“What Maisie Knew” lays waste to the comforting dogma that children are naturally resilient, and that our casual, unthinking cruelty to them can be answered by guilty and belated displays of affection. It accomplishes this not by means of melodrama, but by a mixture of understatement and thriller-worthy suspense. Every Hollywood hack knows that nothing grabs an audience’s emotions like a child in peril, and the directors make expert use of this wisdom, deploying Nick Urata’s score and sly tricks of framing and focus to create a mood of disorientation and dread. What Maisie learns is that nobody will protect her. And yet what we see, just over her head, might best be described as a sex farce. After the split with Susanna, Beale takes up with Margo (Joanna Vanderham), who had been Maisie’s live-in nanny and who remains the only trustworthy adult in her life. Susanna, more out of calculation than affection, takes up with Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard), a studly young fellow without much ambition. These stepparents in effect share custody of the girl, and they begin to look like an impromptu, unofficial family. James’s book ends on a sly, perfect note of ambiguity: “She still had room for wonder at what Maisie knew.” (“She” is Mrs. Wix, a character who has been folded into Margo in the film). The viewer of “What Maisie Knew,” devastated and relieved by this intimate tale of betrayal and perseverance, is left in a similarly divided state of confusion and amazement, with ample room for wonder. “What Maisie Knew” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

It’s quite another to watch a movie of the same thing. Movies are themselves a kind of magic, dependent on technological wizardry. That’s why, when watching a film of a humble magic trick, you feel no sense of wonder, for the stunt has already been accomplished in a medium that’s all about illusion. So what, you shrug. “Now You See Me” is a so-what movie on a grand scale that tries to transcend this unbreachable barrier through the sheer size and the audacity of its prestidigitation. The movie, directed by Louis Leterrier (“Clash of the Titans,” “The Incredible Hulk”), from a screenplay by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt, follows the adventures of a high-flying magicians’ supergroup. Calling themselves the Four Horsemen, they strut to the stage like Olympic athletes prepared to execute feats worthy of science fiction, which they pull off without missing a beat but with a lot of help from computer-generated effects. Their leader, J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), is an arrogant, fast-talking cardsharp and sleight-of-hand virtuoso. His motto: the closer you look, the less you see. The equally devious Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), a mentalist with a streak of cruelty, specializes in hypnosis. Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) is a pickpocket, and Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) is an escape artist who in her big number is chained and dropped into a tank filled with piranhas.The screenplay primes us to expect a Robin Hood-like heist fable in which the Four Horsemen steal money from big banks and rain it down on the struggling masses. In their initial stunt in Las Vegas, a member of the audience is teleported to a Parisian bank vault, whose cash is magically showered on the cheering Las Vegas audience in a matter of seconds. Although the movie slows just enough to describe the mechanics of the robbery, the more detailed the explanation, the more implausible it sounds.Up to this point, “Now You See Me” is an enjoyable goof that in its giddy way evokes a world propelled by technological wizardry enabling those who are clever enough to steal from everybody else. But the scatterbrained story loses its thread and becomes a dull, frenetic chase movie in which the Four Horsemen repeatedly make fools of their pursuers, Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), an F.B.I. agent, and Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), an Interpol detective. As he sees his schemes repeatedly backfire, Mr. Ruffalo’s rumpled character resembles a modern-day Columbo. But unlike Columbo, he has a short temper.Also on hand are Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), whose life is dedicated to debunking the fakery in high-end magic and who plays mind games with the Four Horsemen, and Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the group’s rich, supercilious sponsor. There is no particular reason for these characters to exist except for the actors’ star power. Their personalities lend a little flavor to a movie that doesn’t develop any of its characters. At a certain point, Mr. Caine simply disappears from the film without a trace. The chase carries the Four Horsemen from Las Vegas to New Orleans and to New York for their grand finale. The prelude to the group’s farewell performance is an elaborately staged, overlong, meaningless car crash on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.

It is commonplace in many African countries nowadays for homosexuality to be denounced as an un-African disease imported from abroad. But as this movie shows, in rallies and workshops conducted by visiting American evangelicals like Lou Engle and Scott Lively, virulent homophobia is the real import.The same antigay rhetoric heard in the United States during the ascendancy of Anita Bryant and the evangelical right — but much harsher — is spewed by Ugandan zealots campaigning for the passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, first introduced in 2009 and still pending. If the bill is passed by Uganda’s Parliament, homosexuals will face life imprisonment, and anyone who knows of the existence of a homosexual but fails to report it within 24 hours will face three years in prison. Those punishments lead the list of draconian proposals.Directed by Katherine Fairfax Wright and Malika Zouhali-Worrall, this is a scary but inspiring film with real heroes and villains. Leading the list of heroes is David Kato, a fearless activist and prime mover in Uganda’s gay rights movement. Uganda’s first openly gay man, he was bludgeoned to death in January 2011 at 46. In a brief biography at the beginning of the film, he tells of his coming out during the six years he lived in South Africa, where a more tolerant atmosphere prevails.Other valiant souls include his closest friend, Naome, a lesbian activist, and Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, who has been expelled from the Anglican Church of Uganda for his defense of gay rights. The film’s most upsetting scene is a clash between antigay and gay activists at Mr. Kato’s funeral.The villains include David Bahati, a member of Parliament who in 2009 introduced legislation proposing the death penalty for a “serial offender” of the “offense of homosexuality,” and Giles Muhame, the managing editor of Rolling Stone, a popular tabloid unconnected with the American magazine of the same name. Under the headline “Hang Them,” it published the pictures, names and addresses of 100 men and women thought to be gay. There are a few rays of light in the film. Mr. Kato, for all his seriousness as an activist, is playful and upbeat, and in scenes in which he and his friends are together in safe places, their high spirits are unquenchable. The documentary also notes a victory that was won three weeks before his death, in Uganda’s High Court, which ruled that Rolling Stone had threatened the “fundamental rights and freedoms” of gay people and violated their constitutional right to privacy. Because of international pressure, Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, has warned that passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill could isolate the country. To those pursuing antigay legislation, he has urged caution and moderation.",1,8941.0,,0

O. SCOTT,Snail’s Pace Can Win the Race,"“Turbo” is a new movie from DreamWorks Animation Studios about a little snail with a big dream. It is also the latest animated feature to use an animal’s frustration with the limitations of his species as a metaphor for human aspirations. Much as the rat Remy in “Ratatouille” did not want to eat garbage, and Mumble the penguin in “Happy Feet” wanted to dance, so does Turbo — given name Theo, voice courtesy of Ryan Reynolds — long to move fast. This leads to some amusingly realized visual gags, including a race with a lawn mower. Needless to say, the other snails in the tomato patch, governed by a grim, unvarying, slime-trailed routine and subject to random crow attacks, do not respect Theo’s ambitions. The chief naysayer is his brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), who makes a persuasive case against the idea that a garden pest might do something like compete in the Indianapolis 500.But this is America! Anything is possible, including that millions of parents and children might flock to this adequate morsel of committee-produced entertainment. They don’t call it DreamWorks for nothing. But it is interesting to note that a movie strenuously preaching the virtue of being different should be so fundamentally — so deliberately, so timidly — just like everything else of its kind. Yes, there has never been a 3-D cartoon about a snail before, though there have been a handful of charming children’s picture books about snails, including Vivian Walsh and J. Otto Seibold’s heart-rending “Gluey.” Still, even in the absence of originality, there is fun to be had, thanks to some loopy, clever jokes (the script is by Darren Lemke, Robert Siegel and David Soren, who directed) and a lively celebrity voice cast that also includes Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, Ken Jeong, Maya Rudolph, Richard Jenkins, Michael Peña and Luis Guzmán. (Not a lot of women on that list, you’ll notice — true to formula once again.)Mr. Peña and Mr. Guzmán play Tito and Angelo, brothers who run a taco truck near a run-down strip mall in Los Angeles. They and the owners of the other businesses — a nail salon, a hobby store and an auto repair shop — cannot seem to attract customers, and Tito hits on a foolproof plan. If Theo can enter and win Indy with the sponsorship of the mall’s tenants, all their problems will be solved.It should go without saying that Theo, in becoming Turbo, has acquired automotive superpowers and is able to accelerate to racetrack speeds in his shell, without the aid of wheels or gasoline. Like Remy the rat, he is beguiled and disappointed by a French-accented idol, a racing champion voiced by Bill Hader. The film’s climax is a 200-lap showdown between them.It’s all very rousing in the usual way, but “Turbo” leaves a slightly sour aftertaste, and not only because of its own brave choice of mediocrity over excellence. Why, you wonder, should it be necessary for a snail to win the world’s most famous car race? Wouldn’t competing be impressive enough? I’m sort of kidding, but there is something sad about the idea that a group of hard-working entrepreneurs can hope to succeed only by cutting a deal with the hyper-commercial, winner-take-all forces of celebrity and global media. The rest of us will be picked off by the crows or served up in garlic butter.“Turbo” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

You run into guys like this in teenage dramas or comedies, the charm often backed up with sarcasm or a pretty face. But Sutter has genuine heart, and his cheer masks closely held fears, an ambivalence about the future and an insecurity over his separated parents’ past.Similarly, James Ponsoldt’s new film, “The Spectacular Now,” overcomes echoes of familiarity as Sutter finds his way through the end of high school and the responsibilities looming after graduation (that perennial movie horizon) in his small town. Much of this patiently achieved success flows from Miles Teller’s winning, seemingly effortless performance as Sutter, in all his laziness and charm, open-mindedness and fatalism, always with a glimpse of the unease beneath.Adapted from (and somewhat burdened by the twee title of) Tim Tharp’s 2008 book, the movie picks up with Sutter immediately after he is dumped by Cassidy (Brie Larson) over a misunderstanding. As in Mr. Ponsoldt’s other features, “Off the Black” and “Smashed,” booze has a place in the routine of the main character, and Sutter is no different, if perhaps unusual for his age. He recharges his spirits from a flask even while on the job at a men’s wear shop, whose owner is played by a gravelly-voiced Bob Odenkirk.It’s during one hung-over morning that he strikes up a bond with Aimee (Shailene Woodley), a very together bookworm who is dealing with a demanding family life and is unaccustomed to the attention. They make a sweet couple, even if Sutter still has one eye on Cassidy, and their bond bears out Sutter’s better tendencies. It also seems to strengthen him enough to confront his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) about the father he never sees.Just as Aimee’s own challenges help show how young people with problems often find each other, Sutter’s fresh understanding of his dad (Kyle Chandler) yields a warning of the wrong way forward and the ever-renewable sting of abandonment.Shooting in Athens, Ga., where he grew up, Mr. Ponsoldt keeps the perspective close to Sutter, near enough for us to sense faintly that sadness in him. The story, adapted from the novel’s first-person voice by the screenwriters of “(500) Days of Summer,” becomes a bit strained by a third-act bump that comes after the film has already successfully darkened somewhat. Yet Mr. Ponsoldt ably charts a journey through the high stakes of adolescence, with both Sutter and Mr. Teller showing great promise.“The Spectacular Now” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for all the things an average teenager tries to do before graduating.",0,,6850643.0,0

These warring multibillionaires, Nic Wyatt (Mr. Oldman) and Jock Goddard (Mr. Ford), are former partners who will stop at nothing to destroy each other’s empires. When they meet face to face the size of their egos and the depth of their mutual hatred are signaled by the subzero frost of their sharklike grins. “You stood on my shoulders,” Wyatt shouts. “Now I’m standing on your neck,” Goddard retorts.Caught in the cross-fire is the movie’s narrator, Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth), a hotshot young techie and low-level employee of Wyatt’s company who allows himself to be recruited as a corporate spy. Coached by Wyatt’s assistant (Embeth Davidtz), he is supplied with all the trappings of entrepreneurial wealth and tutored in how to ingratiate himself to his future boss before landing a job at Goddard’s company, a transition that the movie makes look ridiculously easy.Mr. Oldman and Mr. Ford are the only actors in the film, directed by Robert Luketic (“Legally Blonde”), skillful enough to navigate the yards of jargon-packed boilerplate in Jason Hall and Barry L. Levy’s thudding screenplay, adapted from Joseph Finder’s 2004 novel of the same title.Mr. Hemsworth’s Adam is the blank at the center of the movie. This 23-year-old Australian hunk (“The Hunger Games”) has all the personality of a mannequin freshly shipped from the factory to Abercrombie & Fitch and still in its plastic wrap. Playing a supposedly ravenous eager beaver from a working-class Brooklyn background who will do anything to succeed, he ambles through the role like an obedient robot. Not since Taylor Lautner has Hollywood ogled a pretty boy this vacant and poorly prepared.The director makes the most obvious use of Mr. Hemsworth by having him take off his shirt at every opportunity and directing his lip-locks with Amber Heard, who plays a haughty Ivy League-educated overachiever, with a fussy attention to lighting and camera angles that bring to mind a deluxe perfume commercial. In critical ways the movie feels both out of date and out of touch. Ms. Heard’s character, Emma, confesses to a weakness for recreational sex with “bridge and tunnel guys.” But hipsters and literati have superseded blue-collar roughnecks as symbolizing Brooklyn’s image. There is not a trace of that borough in Adam’s voice, and in a ludicrous casting choice, Richard Dreyfuss plays his father, a security guard with emphysema who embodies solid working-class values. The father-son relationship is borrowed directly from “Wall Street.” For a movie that pretends to be tech-savvy there is no mention of Silicon Valley or Seattle. The action is centered in New York City with a side trip to eastern Long Island. The camera drools over the pricey real estate and the endless array of flashing gadgets wielded by its characters. How many concealed cameras and microphones can you remove from a lavish apartment and still be under surveillance, it wonders? Although the answer to that question is reason enough for Adam to be jumping out of his skin with terror, the movie is too much in love with its vision of the Manhattan high life and high-tech gadgetry to flesh out its title: it fails to conjure a semblance of paranoia. Even when Adam is lethally menaced by Wyatt’s enforcer (Julian McMahon), who has a history of murder, Adam remains essentially unperturbed. A more accurate title for “Paranoia” might be “Slightly Worried.”“Paranoia” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations, some violence and strong language.",0,5334926.0,7388654.0,1

O. SCOTT,"Microcosm of Society, Seeking an Anchor","In Europe as in the United States, immigration is a politically contentious issue most often addressed in abstract demographic and ideological terms. There have been movies that try to give the problem a human face, focusing on the struggles of families and individuals, frequently with well-meaning sentimentality.“The Pirogue,” a remarkably cleareyed, quietly ambitious film from the Senegalese director Moussa Touré, takes a different approach. In chronicling a perilous sea voyage from Africa to Spain — a common, frequently fatal undertaking, in spite of the European economic crisis — the film dispenses with hopeful piety, bluntly presenting a reality that is all too easily ignored or turned into fodder for slogans and wishful thinking.The film begins with a festival that blends dance, ritual and wrestling, and that offers a glimpse of modern Africa’s cultural vitality. The 30 men and one woman who set off in the long, brightly painted wooden canoe that gives the movie its name are not necessarily eager to abandon their home. The captain of the boat, Baye Laye, is especially reluctant. But the fish that once supplied his livelihood are scarcer than they used to be, and so is money. After holding out for a while, Baye Laye (Souleymane Seye Ndiaye), who has a wife and children to support, accepts the job. The passengers include his brother, an aspiring musician, and another young man who dreams of playing professional soccer. Others have more practical, or at least more modest, ambitions. A tribal elder is leading a group of men seeking agricultural employment in Spain. Another man hopes to work until he can afford a prosthesis for the leg he lost in an accident. The woman — Nafy (Mame Astou Diallo), a stowaway who agrees to pay for her passage by preparing meals — is trying to reunite with her children after her husband drowned on a similar voyage.Every fictional boat — from the whaling ship in “Moby-Dick” to the dinghy in “Life of Pi” — is a society in microcosm, and if Baye Laye’s passengers share a basic economic motive, they also represent a diverse array of backgrounds and beliefs. Some wear traditional clothing, while others favor hip-hop and Hollywood-influenced fashions. There are pious Muslims and cynical hedonists, and each migrant approaches the journey with a distinctive blend of superstition and pragmatism.Mr. Touré surveys their interactions with sympathy, but without insisting on the innocence or heroism of anyone on board. As they run into trouble, and optimism turns first to anxiety and then to desperation, their fragile solidarity is tested, and so is each individual’s capacity for cowardice, bravery and compassion. At one point they encounter another boat whose engine has failed, and the pleas of the Africans on board represent a terrible moral dilemma and also, perhaps, an omen. Should Baye Laye and the others on his pirogue risk their own lives by helping the others, or should they turn away in the interests of their own survival? It is an awful choice and a devastating moment in a film that is full of them. But the most powerful thing about “The Pirogue” is the way it deals with emotionally charged events matter-of-factly, rather than melodramatically. The story Mr. Touré has chosen to tell is both painfully specific — about these individuals, in this boat — and immeasurably vast, since the experience it depicts is shared by millions of people around the world. And yet somehow he gets the scale just right.",1,11165.0,,0

The Colombian-Canadian director Lina Rodriguez, who lives in Toronto, observes the daily lives of a family of three in Bogotá. But after a midfilm rupture, the movie reveals that the seemingly uneventful first section was more consequential than it appeared. As such, “This Time Tomorrow” poses a hazard for any spoiler-conscious reviewer. It’s also more admirable in theory than it is illuminating in practice.The key to the film may lie in its second shot, of a father, Francisco (Francisco Zaldua), and his teenage daughter, Adelaida (Laura Osma), watching television. Adelaida lazily calls to her mother, Lena (Maruia Shelton), who is out of frame in the next room. Lena is variously shown as Adelaida’s comforter, advice-giver on boyfriends and occasional object of pique.But after Lena’s birthday, the screen fades to black. When the movie returns, Ms. Rodriguez cuts among a succession of downcast faces. It’s probably not saying too much to reveal that “This Time Tomorrow” concerns the shock of an unexpected death, and how the sudden absence changes the lives of the family members who remain.Although Ms. Rodriguez includes a certain amount of foreshadowing, both in the title and in dialogue, few films are so rigorous in trying to evoke a structuring absence.

The movie, originally titled “Happy Few,” is French, after all. French culture is very relaxed when it comes to portraying sex without shame, and the actors going through the motions are very good at it.Rachel (Marina Foïs), whose viewpoint the movie adopts more than anyone else’s, is a jewelry designer; her husband, Franck (Roschdy Zem), is a feng shui expert at work on a book called “Feng Shui for Couples”; and they have a daughter. When Rachel engages Vincent (Nicolas Duvauchelle), a handsome, tattooed designer, to build her Web site, a mutual flirtation leads to a dinner party with Vincent and his French-American wife, Teri (Élodie Bouchez), a former Olympic gymnast.That very evening, after Franck kisses Teri while giving her a back massage, the couples, with virtually no prior discussion, fall into an arrangement in which they begin regularly swapping partners for sex while becoming one another’s best friends. There are no fixed rules.For voyeurs, there is something for everyone. Each character is beautiful in a different way, and all of them have shapely bodies. The blond, slim Rachel is reminiscent of the younger Meg Ryan. Teri is dark-haired, peppery and athletic. Franck, who is French-Moroccan, has a healer’s touch. Vincent, the least talkative, is brooding and tightly wound. He introduces Rachel to light face slapping and violent penetration during sex, which she enjoys so much she asks Franck to give it a try.The protracted nude sex scenes, beautifully photographed in natural light, are simultaneously matter-of-fact and blissful, and warm-blooded viewers may feel more than a tinge of envy. That may be why the reaction to the movie at the 2010 Venice Film Festival was so snide and dismissive.The biggest problem with “Four Lovers,” whose screenplay was written by Mr. Cordier and Julie Peyr, is the degree to which it glosses over its subject and characters. To add up to anything more than a sexy romp with comic touches, it would have had to go much further than it dares. If the sex scenes tell you a little about the characters, they don’t reveal nearly enough. When the increasingly curious wives begin to question their spouses and to compare notes with each other, you want more explicit psychosexual details and stronger reactions.We are asked to take it on faith that their domestic partnerships were as happy and satisfying before the new arrangement is struck as they appear to be afterward. And we are also asked to believe that none of the four have any sexual dysfunction or anxiety once the trading has begun. Their togetherness culminates in a ridiculous scene in which all four pour flour on one another and have sex in sight of one another.For much of the movie, the children (Teri and Vincent have two) are practically invisible. Eventually Teri’s preadolescent daughter presents her mother with Rachel’s diary, which she stole, and Teri furtively reads it.What is most annoying about “Four Lovers” is that it is the opposite of what it pretends to be. Its blasé exterior is a camouflage for its failure to address fundamental questions of marriage, family, monogamy, jealousy, competitiveness and boredom. The deepest question it asks is whether it is possible to love two people at the same time.Rachel, Franck, Vincent and Teri are not upstart bohemian rebels but verging-on-middle-aged members of the urban bourgeoisie. Although they are pretty, and their simulated sex appetizing, they are not hard-core swingers. So who are they?Too lazy and too scared to say anything pertinent about love, society and the human condition, “Four Lovers” is content to be a pleasant, mildly titillating divertissement with no meaning at all.",0,,,0

Another one goes kablooey in “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,” a sequel to the 2008 film “Journey to the Center of the Earth” that again gives a Jules Verne tale 3-D treatment.Sean (Josh Hutcherson), the only major returnee from the earlier movie, receives a radio transmission that leads him to believe that his grandfather is on a fantastical island in the middle of nowhere, and he and his stepfather (Dwayne Johnson) go looking for it.The usual escape-before-the-big-blast stuff ensues, augmented by some fairly tedious family dynamics.

SCOTT,"Injustice, British and Otherwise","Class consciousness has frequently played a role in Mike Leigh’s films, and not only because, as a storyteller whose native terrain is modern Britain, he can hardly hope to avoid it. And sure enough, the observant viewer of his splendidly rich and wise new feature, “Another Year,” will notice the shadows that an always-evolving system of social hierarchy casts over the passage of the seasons. (“We’re all graduates,” one character reminds another, with the prickly pride of belonging to the first generation to receive a university education in an era of expanded opportunity.)But in this movie, as in its immediate precursor, “Happy-Go-Lucky,” Mr. Leigh is also after a more elusive and troubling form of injustice, one that is almost cosmically mysterious even as it penetrates, and sometimes threatens to poison, the relationships that make up everyday life.Like “Happy-Go-Lucky,” though on a somewhat larger scale, “Another Year” is about the unequal distribution of happiness. Why do some people — like Tom and Gerri, the post-’60s 60-something couple at the center of this episodic story — seem to have an inexhaustible, even superabundant supply, while others seem unable to acquire even the smallest portion? Can happiness be borrowed, stolen or inherited? Is it earned by meritorious works or granted by the obscure operations of grace?These may sound like silly, abstract questions, but they could hardly be more serious or more relevant. Here in America, after all, the pursuit of happiness has the status of a foundational right, coincident, but not quite identical, with material prosperity. In Britain, where dourness can seem to be as much a part of the stereotypical national character as bad food, foul weather and precise distinctions of status, the assertion of a right to be happy can seem almost revolutionary.Certainly Poppy, the antically joyful heroine of “Happy-Go-Lucky,” was a radically free spirit, almost violent in her expressions of good feeling. Tom and Gerri, played with uncanny subtlety and tremendous soul by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen, are much more subdued but no less radiant, and just as extreme in their delight. Their long, comfortable marriage seems to have unfolded without serious friction or disappointment.Tom is a geologist who lends his expertise to public works projects in London and abroad, and whose professional enthusiasm combines a craftsman’s pride in handiwork with a nerd’s glee at knowing stuff. Gerri is a therapist who counsels patients at a clinic, one of them a lower-middle-class housewife (played by Imelda Staunton, the star of Mr. Leigh’s “Vera Drake”), whose bottomless despair is the complete reverse  of Gerri’s fulfillment.The film’s more complicated and sustained contrast is between Gerri and Mary, her co-worker and longtime friend, played by Lesley Manville with the kind of wrenching, borderline-unbearable lack of self-protective actorly vanity that reminds you that, however gentle it may seem, this is still a Mike Leigh film. In other words, the spectacle of humiliation that takes place when uncomfortable self-consciousness turns into its opposite is never far away. Such mortal embarrassment stalks Mary, who is needy, insecure and prone to drink too much, and also Ken (Peter Wight), an old chum of Tom’s who packs the same traits into a large, shambling masculine frame.In their company, Tom and Gerri are patient, kind and nonjudgmental, offering advice and encouragement and overlooking behavior that might make less generous spirits cringe. But their goodness is so thorough that it may inspire some unkind thoughts. Do they associate with Mary and Ken out of genuine affection, or because spending time with such miserable types makes them feel (and look) better? Is their tolerant solicitude a form of complacency? And is “Another Year” therefore not a loving portrait of the modern liberal temperament but rather a quietly seething indictment of its nose-in-the-air narcissism?Either possibility is far too simplistic, partly because Mr. Leigh pays such close attention to the rhythms of Tom and Gerri’s life and to details of their background, Tom’s in particular. In a late section (the story is told in chapters corresponding to the seasons) a death in the family calls him from London back to his hometown, Hull, a sojourn that serves as a reminder of how, in today’s Britain, class divisions often persist in the form of regional disparities.The light in the North is grim and hard, compared with London’s sunshine, and the existences of Tom’s brother, Ronnie (David Bradley), and his family are bleak and circumscribed. You understand what Tom managed to escape. You also understand that his smiling embrace of every detail of his life with Gerri — the Volvo, the garden, the holidays in Ireland — is a sign not of smugness, but rather of gratitude.So Tom and Gerri are happy, and “Another Year” is genuinely happy for them and also, eventually, for their son, Joe (Oliver Maltman), a decent chap who genially endures Mary’s increasingly feverish and jealous attention. But sorrow and its implications cannot be banished entirely from this chronicle of their contentment. Ronnie, glum and silent as a wood carving, represents an older Britain of want and resignation, in which people were expected to know their place.That world has been displaced by a meritocracy, which brings its own discontents. Its citizens are free to rise and to find their own way, but this freedom makes them ultimately responsible for their own satisfaction, branding a sad sack like Ken and a wounded bird like Mary with the stigma of failure. They — Mary, in particular, as the film’s devastating final shot makes plain — are have-nots bereft of the comforts of solidarity and beyond the reach of charity. To quote Paul McCartney, another great British artist who is almost exactly Mr. Leigh’s age: Where do they all come from? Where do they all belong?“Another Year” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,When Two Cultures Collide Under One Roof,"“When We Leave,” the first feature written and directed by Feo Aladag, is a somber, sometimes powerful and frequently schematic drama about a woman trying to free herself from the emotional and physical violence of a cruel, patriarchal system. The violence is present from the very first shot, in which a young man (we will eventually learn that he is one of the main character’s brothers) points a gun at a woman walking with her child. What follows flashes back from that moment, tracing a path of brutality, oppression and stifled individuality leavened by a few glimmers of tenderness and grace.Umay, played by the remarkable Turkish-German actress Sibel Kekilli, lives in Turkey with her young son, Cem (Nizam Schiller); her husband, Kemal (Ufuk Bayraktar); and Kemal’s family. Tired of Kemal’s abuse, she flees with Cem to Berlin, where she grew up and where her own family still lives. Here parents, brothers and sisters welcome her warmly, for the most part,  but also warily, anxious that her flight has put both her honor and theirs in jeopardy.“You belong to your husband,” says her father, Kader (Settar Tanriögen), who also tells her that the hands that beat her “are also the hands that soothe.”This is hardly comforting. Worse is the response of Mehmet (Tamer Yigit), the older of Umay’s two brothers, whose temper is if anything more volatile than Kemal’s. He threatens her, tries to confine her in the family’s apartment and arranges to have Cem sent back to Turkey. When Umay learns of this plan, she calls the police, who take her and the boy to a women’s shelter, after which she tries to forge a life on her own.Ms. Aladag, an Austrian-born actress with many film and television credits in that country, Germany and Britain, works in the quiet, stricken tones of modern socially conscious melodrama. Each scene makes its emotional and thematic point carefully, and builds into a solid, absorbing, conventional story, by which I mean that while there are twists and reversals in the plot, nothing really comes as a surprise.And because everything that happens is intended to illuminate the problem that is Ms. Aladag’s main concern — the so-called honor killings of women in Muslim communities in Europe and the Middle East — the behavior of the characters seems constricted. There is only intermittently a sense of how life is lived; only rules, obligations, heavy sighs and bitter contradictions.What saves “When We Leave” from lapsing entirely into well-intentioned, punishing grimness is Ms. Aladag’s respect for physical space and for the complicated human presence of the actors. The apartment where Umay’s family lives is a fascinating amalgam of two homelands. She speaks mostly Turkish with her father, her mother and Mehmet, and German with her sister and younger brother. The atmosphere in the family’s home suggests both an aspiration to middle-class German respectability and some of the courtesy and formality that characterize traditional Anatolian society.Ms. Kekilli, whose quiet charisma and fearless emotional command galvanized Fatih Akin’s “Head-On” — another, far more nuanced and disturbing drama of violence, desire and the collision of cultures — holds the film together even when the script pushes Umay in some unconvincing directions. A scene in which she crashes her sister’s wedding and makes a spectacle of herself is particularly dubious, given how hard Umay works to protect her dignity. But it is almost impossible, given the strength and conviction of Ms. Kekilli’s performance, to avoid being moved, even if, on reflection, the emotions do not entirely make sense.The other outstanding performance in a film full of strong acting comes from Mr. Tanriögen, who does much to humanize what might have been a cipher of patriarchal domination. Kader, who works in a printing plant, is terrified of losing face and suffers at the thought of what Umay will do to his family’s reputation. But he is also a loving father trying, much as his daughter is, to find some workable common ground between them.Failure is preordained, and “When We Leave” walks a delicate boundary between tragedy and a flimsier, easier form of pathos. It is frequently gripping and sincere in its intentions, but never quite as revelatory, or as devastating, as it should be.WHEN WE LEAVEOpens on Friday  in New York and Los Angeles.Written and directed by Feo Aladag; director of photography, Judith Kaufmann; edited by Andrea Mertens; music by Max Richter and Stéphane Moucha; production design by Silke Buhr; costumes by Gioia Raspé; produced by Feo Aladag and Züli Aladag; released by Olive Films.

168,2011-02-18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:12,JEANNETTE CATSOULIS,‘Now & Later’ Explores Sex and Politics,"Essentially a two-person play liberally sprinkled with gleaming, groovy, graphic sex, “Now & Later” exudes an amiably accessible vibe that softens the edges of its freewheeling explicitness.Lest we enjoy all this flesh without an ennobling context, the movie kicks off with Wilhelm Reich’s assertion of the link between sexual repression and violence. Thus cautioned, we can now guiltlessly appreciate the many and varied couplings of Angela (Shari Solanis), a sizzling illegal immigrant from Nicaragua, and Bill (James Wortham), a crooked banker on the lam from an eight-year jail sentence.Washing up in Angela’s loft in East Los Angeles, Bill is seduced by her devotion to the poor and dislike of clothing. A free-spirited pleasure sponge, Angela sets about reprogramming her uptight lover by means of a lecture-and-lip-lock curriculum: philosophy rewarded by fellatio; politics as a prelude to masturbation; third world poverty capped by a three-way with a male foreign correspondent.The problem is that all this sociopolitical nattering (Angela is buzz-killingly fond of slamming her adoptive country’s foreign policies) tends to drain the heat from the actual sex. Not to mention make some of us rethink our Noam Chomsky fantasies.Offensive only in Mr. Wortham’s dreadful acting, “Now & Later” is part of a series at the Quad called “Unrated: A Week of Sex in Cinema” — a title that should ensure plenty of backsides on seats. The film’s writer and director, Philippe Diaz, professes highfalutin motivations for his randy romp, but his intellectual aspirations are no match for Ms. Solanis. Pliable and charismatic, she slithers around leaden dialogue and a wooden co-star with the confidence of a woman who knows where her real power lies.NOW & LATEROpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Written and directed by Philippe Diaz; director of photography, Denise Brassard; edited by Alberto Gómez;  produced by Beth Portello and Mr. Diaz; released by Cinema Libre  Studio.

169,2011-03-11,Red Riding Hood,"Amanda Seyfried, Gary Oldman, Billy Burke, Shiloh Fernandez","USA, Canada",Catherine Hardwicke,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Romance, Thriller",English,29.0,100.0,David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick,2011,5.5,100320.0,10.0,2017-11-02 04:18:12,MANOHLA DARGIS,The Girl Who Sighed Wolf,"The bluenose brigade at the Motion Picture Association of America has stamped “Red Riding Hood” with a PG-13 rating for “violence and creature terror, and some sensuality.” Certainly this goofily amusing screen fairy tale includes bloodshed, but it’s generally tamer than its often-gruesome source. The creature terror meanwhile isn’t remotely frightening, though the designated mustache twirler (and scene chewer) Gary Oldman tries to rustle up scares. As to sensuality, Amanda Seyfried as You-Know-Who makes a delectable treat whether heaving her bosom or boogieing down in a bacchanal that’s more Burning Man than Bruegel.At this point in her short movie career Ms. Seyfried hasn’t often been asked to do more than hit her marks and deliver her lines, which she does appealingly in “Red Riding Hood.” What she mostly brings to her movies is otherworldly, unthreatening beauty — she has the saucer eyes and heart-shaped face of an anime pixie — and that elusive gift of cinematic presence. When she’s on camera, she draws all eyes to her, something that the director here, Catherine Hardwicke, grasps. Ms. Hardwicke is an uneven, at times careless filmmaker, but as she showed in movies like “Thirteen” and the first “Twilight,” she is attuned to beauty and has a way with young actors, tapping their energy so it buzzes on screen.From the start Ms. Hardwicke tries to make the case that this isn’t your granny’s favorite fairy tale. The story opens with its heroine, Valerie, as a child (Megan Charpentier), strolling about in trousers (the other girls are in dresses) while in voice-over Ms. Seyfried insists that she tried to be a good girl. But goodness had nothing to do with it, as Mae West once quipped, or so Ms. Hardwicke seems to want us to believe. Before long Valerie has run off with a boy pointedly named Peter (first D J Greenburg, later Shiloh Fernandez with hair gel), and they’re frolicking in the forest and snaring a rabbit. Valerie urges Peter to slay the animal, but he can’t or won’t, and the sequence ends with her holding a knife to the bunny like a natural-born killer.The suggestion that Red Riding Hood might be as much predator as prey isn’t new. She may be the intended victim, but she’s also the one who (after sizing up the wolf  in bed) ends triumphant. It’s this blurring between the antagonists  as well as the flexibility of the story’s morals and meanings that make it work well for different readers and writers. In the 17th century Charles Perrault turned an oral folk tale  into “Le Petit Chaperon Rouge,” and three centuries later Angela Carter gave the story a wicked, feminist spin. Ms. Hardwicke doesn’t acknowledge “The Company of Wolves,” Carter’s  brilliant retelling, but it’s probable that she read it or saw Neil Jordan’s dreary 1984 big-screen adaptation.But, my, what sharp teeth Ms. Hardwicke doesn’t have: working from David Leslie Johnson’s screenplay she takes on the story’s grown-up themes of sex and death directly but weakly. This might be because the movie has been  pitched at young adults, as  evidenced by its pretty leads, electronic soundtrack, contemporary vibe and veneer, and caution. Some of the updating works — a proto-hippie witchy woman, the grandmother (Julie Christie) now rocks the screen in dreadlocks — but at other times the modern touches feel like sloppiness or even pandering. It’s hard to know, for instance, if Ms. Hardwicke, a former production designer, didn’t notice that the clothing looks straight from the costume department, or whether she (or her producers) didn’t want to turn off their presumptive audience with anything, you know, old.The introduction of a religious zealot, Father Solomon (Mr. Oldman), adds some busywork drama and action. Summoned to vanquish the computer-generated wolf (an underfed brother to the ludicrous lupine beasts in the “Twilight” franchise), the padre arrives with an armed multicultural entourage and, in a flamboyant touch, a torture chamber cum Easy-Bake Oven shaped like an elephant. (Unlucky prisoners are slow-roasted inside.) At one point Valerie worries with good reason that Father Solomon might mistake her for a witch. But this nod at historic female troubles doesn’t go anywhere, largely because Valerie spends so much time negotiating between dueling loves, Peter and a wealthier suitor, Henry (Max Irons), while juggling her mother, Suzette (Virginia Madsen, rouged and Maybellined), and father, Cesaire (Billy Burke).When the wolf in one of Carter’s Red Riding Hood stories explains to the girl why he has big teeth — “All the better to eat you with” — she bursts out laughing. “She knew,” Carter writes, “she was nobody’s meat.” Her insouciance is thrilling. Ms. Hardwicke wants to have her feminism and fairy tale, but Carter’s no-prisoners bad attitude is too far out for an entertainment like “Red Riding Hood,” where only the appearance of girl power will finally do. Given this, it’s worth noting that Ms. Hardwicke, who is deeply enamored of aerial photography, sends the camera repeatedly soaring over the landscape where sometimes a woman in a red cloak as vivid as blood walks with a man across the snowy expanse. It’s a striking image suggestive of freedom, though perhaps it’s really just the guy who this little fairy-tale fugitive needs to escape from.“Red Riding Hood” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

170,2011-03-25,White Irish Drinkers,"Nick Thurston, Geoffrey Wigdor, Karen Allen, Stephen Lang",USA,John Gray,Drama,English,51.0,109.0,John Gray,2010,6.8,1631.0,44.0,2017-11-02 04:18:13,STEPHEN HOLDEN,John Gray’s ‘White Irish Drinkers’,"Putting profane adjectives in front of every other noun in dialogue that wants desperately to sound streetwise doesn’t make it feel authentic if the other words spoken by the characters are arranged into orderly little blocks of exposition. That tidiness is the fatal flaw of John Gray’s semi-autobiographical “White Irish Drinkers,” especially in scenes during which its nice young protagonist sits around shooting the breeze with his neighborhood pals.Set in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn in 1975, the movie is a fill-in-the-blanks kitchen-sink drama peopled with the usual stereotypes: a sensitive young artist who draws in secret, his bullying older brother who is headed on the wrong path, their drunken father and their long-suffering mother.The artist, 18-year-old Brian (Nick Thurston), is a fish out of water in his rough neighborhood. His older brother, Danny (Geoff Wigdor), who robs jewelry stores, pressures him to go bad and hurls homophobic epithets when he balks. Their father, Patrick (Stephen Lang), arrives home drunk and slaps Danny around. Their mother, Margaret (Karen Allen), who has endured her husband’s abuse for decades, staunchly defends him. There is an utterly predictable romance (with obstacles) between and Brian and Shauna (Leslie Murphy), who works in a neighborhood travel agency.Brian works as an assistant to Whitey (Peter Riegert), the perpetually indebted owner of a decrepit local movie theater. Using his one contact in the rock world, Whitey conceives a ludicrous scheme to book the Rolling Stones in his theater for one night and to sell tickets for $50 apiece, to be paid in cash. Danny expects Brian to help him to steal the money once it is collected. That’s all I’ll say.Because Mr. Thurston and Mr. Wigdor lack the hard shells necessary to make their characters credible, “White Irish Drinkers” feels synthetic. Mr. Lang and the older cast members fare better, but they can’t save a movie that runs on clichés. STEPHEN HOLDEN“White Irish Drinkers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nonstop profanity, nudity and some mild violence.WHITE IRISH DRINKERSOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by John Gray; director of photography, Seamus Tierney; edited by Neil Mandelberg; music by  Mark Snow; production design by Tomasso Ortino; costumes by Nicole  Capasso; produced by Mr. Gray, Melissa Jo Peltier, Paul Bernard and  James Scura; released by Screen Media Films.

The church is a somewhat stealthy supporting player within the film, based on the true tale of Bethany Hamilton, the rising 13-year-old amateur competition surfer in Hawaii who in 2003 lost an arm to a shark. But the piety takes a backseat to the welcome glimmers of grit. As a portrait of a spirited, resilient athlete, the movie succeeds best, unafraid to face its heroine’s daunting challenges directly.After scenes introducing its characters, including Bethany’s surfer parents (Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt, both excellent), Bethany (AnnaSophia Robb) is attacked in Hanalei and raced to a hospital. (The sequence, while gore free, is agonizing and not for young children.) From there the film presents her efforts to get back in competition; her fitful, painful setbacks; and a lesson in context when she helps tsunami victims on a volunteer church expedition to Thailand. Ms. Hunt and Mr. Quaid may be a surprising presence here, but not the country singer Carrie Underwood, as a saintly youth counselor.The movie dazzles in its surfing sequences, in which the director, Sean McNamara, works nimble editing and a tropical palette to a fine sheen. And Ms. Robb makes an appealing Bethany, wounded but determined and largely self-reliant. During the closing credits the real Ms. Hamilton appears on screen and thanks Jesus in voice-over. While this story is certainly about faith, “Soul Surfer” is most inspiring when it exalts faith in one’s self.“Soul Surfer” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has an intense attack-and-rescue sequence.SOUL SURFEROpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Sean McNamara;  written by Mr. McNamara, Deborah Schwartz, Douglas Schwartz and Michael  Berk, based on the book by Bethany Hamilton, Sheryl Berk and Rick  Bundschuh and a screen story by Mr. McNamara, Ms. Schwartz, Mr.  Schwartz, Mr. Berk, Matt R.

And in “That’s What I Am,” Mike Pavone’s righteous reflection on bullying and tolerance, Mr. Harris’s depiction of a saintly, soft-spoken, bow-tie-wearing middle-school teacher lends the movie a moral weight it probably couldn’t have summoned had another actor played the role.Set in 1965 in a small Southern California town, “That’s What I Am” is a sentimental Hallmark-style movie (part after-school special, part “Wonder Years” offshoot) whose narrator, Andy Nichol (voiced by an uncredited actor who sounds like Greg Kinnear), looks back on his middle-school experience. His beloved teacher, Mr. Simon (Mr. Harris), is first seen reading to a class from Mark Twain’s “Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc.” This choice of literature sets him up as a martyrlike figure.Later in the movie, when a bully retaliates against Mr. Simon’s discipline by spreading unfounded rumors about his sexuality, the teacher, a widower, refuses out of principle to deny the rumors. At this point you wonder if “That’s What I Am” will turn into a movie about a vicious, small-town witch hunt, but it is too timid to go there. It is more interested in the buildup to Andy’s first kiss with Mary Clear (Mia Rose Frampton), a kindhearted, more experienced classmate.The movie’s depiction of the savage pecking order of school is mild; the children, obsessed with “cooties,” seem naïve even by 1965 standards. The principal outcast, Stanley (Alexander Walters), a k a Big G (for the ginger hue of his hair), is a tall, gawky boy with big ears who comports himself with unshakable dignity when faced with peer-group persecution. The 12-year-old Andy (Chase Ellison) learns to respect Big G after Mr. Simon assigns them to collaborate on a project.Because “That’s What I Am” is a production of WWE Studios, it slips in a wrestling star, Randy Orton, as the lying bully’s rabidly homophobic father.At heart “That’s What I Am” is really a gentle, earnest illustration of a slogan that Mr. Simon submits in a contest to come up with a solution to world peace in 25 words or less. His entry, which he scrawls on the blackboard, reads “Human dignity + compassion = peace.” It wins him a flashy car.“That’s What I Am” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its cursory discussion of homosexuality may offend certain viewers.THAT’S WHAT I AMOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Mike Pavone; director of photography, Kenneth Zunder; edited by Marc Pollon; music by James Raymond; production design by Raymond Pumilia; costumes by Claire Breaux; produced by Denise Chamian; released by Samuel Goldwyn Films and WWE Studios.

Williams) on the balmy island of Eleuthera. Both are a little annoying: Romeo has a girlfriend, a history with drugs and a fondness for flashing his assets; Jonny’s inability to emote is threatening his painting scholarship.“You need to relax,” croons Romeo, teaching Jonny to float, slow dance and jump off a cliff — literally and figuratively. Lying in wait is Lena (Margaret Laurena Kemp), a poisonous pastor’s wife burning with a venereal disease contracted from her down-low husband (Mark Richard Ford). Spouting prejudice and scripture, Lena redirects her marital fury into antigay verbiage and a flirtation with a more open-minded reverend (a dreamy Van Brown). Unfortunately a naked bedtime cuddle fails to result in a transfer of tolerance.A message movie elevated by sincere performances and Ian Bloom’s stunningly tactile photography, “Children of God” struggles to transcend weak writing. “I felt like I had a responsibility to reflect the reality that I was living in,” Mr. Mortimer said in a 2010 interview. (Just months before filming, several gay men were killed in one of the movie’s key locations.) But characters need to be more than vehicles for making a point, and a genuinely heartfelt tone is only partial compensation for an inability to convey the complexity of ideas.CHILDREN OF GODOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Kareem Mortimer; director of photography, Ian Bloom; edited by Maria Cataldo; production design by Margot Bethel; produced by Trevite A.

O. SCOTT,"A Rural Struggle for Subsistence, Rooted in Dignity","The title of Uruphong Raksasad’s “Agrarian Utopia” evokes the romance of rural toil, and also the political ideal, present in various Western back-to-the-land movements, of life lived close to the soil. And the film’s bucolic rhythms and stunning vistas of the Thai countryside give it a sometimes-idyllic quality. One of its subjects, whose long hair, plaid shirts and pointy beard give him the aspect of a hippie philosopher, espouses what sound like variations of locavore and organic-farming ideas.But the reality Mr. Raksasad investigates is a harsh one, and after a year in the fields and forests (which equals two hours in the theater) his title takes on a different meaning. Utopia, after all, is another name for the impossible, and the brutal economic pressures weighing on the two families whose labor is the film’s focus suggest that the kind of simple, ancient, dignified life they want to lead may not be sustainable.Driven off their own property by debt — one man remarks that it’s very easy to get a loan in Thailand, but almost impossible to pay it back — the families go to work for a landowner whose appearances in the movie bookend a cycle of seasons. Mr. Raksasad is sparing in his recordings of human speech and as generous with other sounds as he is with colorful, widescreen compositions. The landscape changes from lush green to crackly and brown as the harvest approaches and the rice is packaged for sale. The families, toiling for subsistence as well as cash, hunt grubs, snakes, rats and dogs. They also forage for mushrooms and search out beehives for honey.The children clamor for pocket electronic games and motorbikes, while their parents talk about saving for school tuition. Sometimes they talk about moving to Bangkok, but the men in particular resist the compromises that urban life would bring. The mood is not one of misery, but of quiet, weary endurance punctuated with moments of joy.Hanging over it all is the turmoil of Thailand’s political situation, which seeps into conversations out in the countryside and also, at the beginning and end of “Agrarian Utopia,” onto the screen. The unsettled fate of the People’s Power Party, which represented the interests of the rural poor, is one of the film’s themes, as is the disjunction between political rhetoric and the realities of agricultural existence. The simple life turns out to be, in the modern world, an endlessly complicated matter.AGRARIAN UTOPIAOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed and edited by Uruphong Raksasad; director of photography, Mr. Raksasad; produced by Pimpaka Towira; released by Extra Virgin.

But Tigmanshu Dhulia’s uneven, absorbing Hindi film “Paan Singh Tomar,” based on real events, falls into the category of truth is stranger than cinema.Paan Singh Tomar (Irrfan Khan) comes from the Chambal Valley (south of Delhi), a stronghold of professional bandits, or dacoits. (Dacoits, he says — and the film seems to agree — are what you find in Parliament; rebels are what Chambal breeds.) He joins the army, where his running talent is discovered. A champion, he quits to return to his village, where a land struggle has turned bloody. When the corrupt police and corrupt government won’t help settle the matter, Paan Singh picks up a gun and embarks on a life outside the law.The film’s first half has some of a sports movie’s excitement, made more interesting by its details and milieu: India, the army, the competitions abroad. (Given his first pair of spiked running shoes right before a race in Tokyo, he pulls them off midway through and finishes barefoot.) The second half, following his outlaw career, may seem more familiar; it plays like a western (and looks like “Sholay”), with Paan Singh and his gang operating from the rocky countryside.Both halves are elevated by Mr. Khan. Without romanticizing Paan Singh, he shows his basic honesty and gives him real depth. As an actor Mr. Khan rarely does the expected. You can’t take your eyes off him.",0,39567.0,40311.0,0

What about four fools? There’s no safety in numbers, certainly not in “Double Dhamaal,” a mind-contracting Hindi comedy that seems to take its cues from the Three Stooges, the Keystone Kops and every Bollywood cliché it can chew up and spit back as farce.If that sounds appealing, be warned: Unless your idea of a good joke is a golf ball thwacked into an unsuspecting crotch or the old frying-pan-in-the-kisser gag, you probably won’t like this movie.“Double Dhamaal” (a sequel to 2007’s “Dhamaal”) stars Sanjay Dutt as Kabir, a con-man-businessman who matches wits (as it were) with four bumbling fools (Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Ashish Chowdhry and Jaaved Jaafery, all mugging wildly). There are lots of hard-to-follow doings, but things take off after Kabir tricks the fools into thinking that they’ve discovered oil in Mumbai. (No dice. Their gusher is a sewage pipe.) Somehow everyone ends up in Macau, where Kabir opens a casino called the Four Jokers. Out for revenge, the fools try to ruin him.This corner of the Bollywood universe has no room for political correctness, as is made clear by the fools’ rainbow coalition of ethnic disguises. The worst is Mr. Deshmukh’s drawn-out turn in black face, which gives rise to at least one unforgivably racist joke. (The official Web site’s description of the disguises is clueless too.)The director, Indra Kumar, lets his baggy tale sprawl to 2 hours and 18 minutes and peppers it with references to other, better films and with movie talk in general. “All characters are fictitious,” someone says when the fools are caught scheming on camera, “and bear no resemblance to people living or dead.” In this case, all you can say is amen.DOUBLE DHAMAALOpened on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Indra Kumar; written by Tushar Hiranandani; director of photography, Aseem Bajaj; edited by Sanjay Sankla; music by  Anand Raj Anand; art direction by Tanushree Sarkar; produced by Ashok  Thakeria and Mr. Kumar; released by Reliance Big Pictures.

In Concert,” the recent United States tour starring cast members of Ryan Murphy’s TV juggernaut. Directed by Kevin Tancharoen and filmed over two days at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J., it is a strenuous exercise in cheerleading for the “Glee” franchise. The 3-D makes the performers look like cardboard cutout figures.Concert performances of numbers featured in the show and on its recorded offshoot are interspersed with breathless testimonials from “Gleeks,” fans who gushingly describe how their lives were changed by the show. The hoopla is so relentless that the movie often looks and sounds like an infomercial. Its encouraging message — that “Glee” is good for you, especially if you’re an outsider and feel different from the popular kids — is continually reiterated and culminates with a pounding choral rendition of Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.”Since one of the show’s major characters, the ingenuous Kurt Hummel, is gay — as is Chris Colfer, the gifted 21-year-old performer playing him — “Glee” hammers home variations on the same message of reassurance and self-empowerment as the It Gets Better Project to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teenage suicides: Just screw up your courage, hang in there, be who you are and you will triumph.The most outspoken Gleek testimonial is that of Trenton Thompson, a gay teenager who was dragged out of the closet in the eighth grade after his journal was stolen by a friend and put on the desk of his secret crush. Trenton credits Mr. Colfer’s character for his determination to stand up for himself and be out and proud.The two other most prominent Gleeks are Josey Pickering, an articulate, red-headed girl with Asperger syndrome (of which there is no sign), and Janae Meraz, a smiling, self-assured dwarf who was asked by her dream date to the prom, where she was crowned princess. The movie shows her ecstatic coronation, presumably a re-creation.I don’t know whether these characters are real or fictional composites, or invented from scratch and played by actors. But their tales of ultimate redemption after persecution for geekiness, nerdiness, gayness or whatever sound like prefab fairy tales.Before “Glee: The 3D Concert Movie,” there was “High School Musical” and its never-never land of mostly happy teenagers singing and dancing in the gym and engaging in smiley-faced rites of puppy love; before that there was “Fame.” The insular “Glee” world of William McKinley High School is just as otherworldly as that of “High School Musical.” The series, for all its little melodramas, evokes the same Disney ethos in which every quirk is an opportunity for self-branding, often on a T-shirt.Aside from the testimonials, the only suggestions of a story are intermittent backstage peeks at the characters. The movie’s roughly 20 songs are a pleasant whoosh of beat-driven production numbers acrobatically choreographed by Zach Woodlee and musically supervised by P. J. Bloom. The elaborate arrangements mash musical genres into a slick pastiche performed by singers whose vocal quirks have been meticulously ironed out.Rachel (Lea Michele), the show’s would-be Barbra Streisand, incorporates most of her idol’s vocal mannerisms while ignoring Ms. Streisand’s high-strung emotional core; the famous Streisand-Judy Garland duet of “Happy Days are Here Again” and “Get Happy!” is reprised in a perfectly manicured effort by Ms. Michele and Mr. Colfer (singing the Garland part). Likewise, Rachel’s soul-music counterpart, Mercedes (Amber Riley), suggests a baby Aretha Franklin with the roughness sanded out of her voice, the spontaneous gospel fervor reduced to polished melismas.Other notable performances include Mr. Colfer’s slowed-down “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” delivered as a boy-band-style anthem; Darren Criss’s “Silly Love Songs”; and a splashy “Empire State of Mind,” whose rap has been reduced to an afterthought.There is a paradox at the heart of the film. It strains to celebrate diversity and individualism, while its processed music exemplifies strict corporate teamwork.“Glee: The 3D Concert Movie” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some sensual dancing.GLEEThe 3D Concert MovieOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Kevin Tancharoen; director of photography, Glen MacPherson; edited by Myron Kerstein and Jane Moran; music score by James S.

Some are more successful than others at coming to terms with their grief and anger. All are commendably forthright.“Six years has gone by, and the fact of the matter is that I do remember less of my mother,” says Nick Chirls, who was a high school student when his mother, who worked in financial services in the World Trade Center, was killed. In the course of the film, we see him grow into a young man, one who after college tries to follow in his mother’s footsteps by working on Wall Street.And Tanya Villanueva Tepper, who lost her fiancé and is perhaps this film’s most compelling character study, is strikingly honest as she talks first about her grief, then her decision to let love back into her life. She marries, but only after she has her first child does she realize that it’s odd that she still has photographs on display of her pre-9/11 fiancé.“I just said, it’s time for me; I have to take these down,” she says of the pictures. “I have to let myself off the hook.”Mr. Whitaker sometimes overdoes the syrup content in a film so full of genuine emotion that it has no need of such enhancements.

O. SCOTT,"Making the Most of the Very Least, and Other Lessons","“Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star” is the tale of a small-town boy from Iowa, with a Prince Valiant haircut, a bad overbite and big dreams, who comes, like so many other small-town dreamers, to the San Fernando Valley to become a pornographic film star. There he meets a bunch of other performers who seem to be desperate for work and willing to submit to unimaginable degradation for a chance to appear on the big screen.I’m not talking about the characters in “Bucky Larson,” which was directed by Tom Brady (“The Hot Chick”) and written by, among others, Adam Sandler. I mean the supporting cast, whose names I almost hesitate to mention for fear of embarrassing them. Nick Swardson, who plays Bucky and who is also one of the credited writers (Allen Covert is the third), seems immune to any such shame. With more energy than wit, he takes his turn as the latest overgrown man-boy to make funny faces and funny voices in an R-rated comedy.“Overgrown” that is, in all respects but one. Bucky, who has reached whatever age he is supposed to be — 35? 40? — in a state of complete ignorance about the most basic sexual matters, turns out to be a fellow of exceedingly modest endowment. But this shortcoming proves to be his ticket to stardom, since watching his, er, performances makes average men feel better about themselves.It occurs to me that “Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star” may have been made for a similar purpose, to console every actor who has ever been in a movie that is a little less bad than this one. Let me put the matter another way: this may be the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever been in. Think about that. If you dare, go on Netflix and test the hypothesis.Mr. Shore has a cameo, playing himself hosting an awards ceremony for porn stars. So at least he retains a bit of dignity. I wish the same could be said for — do I have to rat them out? can’t I just pretend I never saw them? — Don Johnson, Kevin Nealon, Stephen Dorff, Edward Hermann and Christina Ricci. Ms. Ricci has the especially thankless role of Bucky’s love interest, a waitress who befriends Bucky when he first arrives in California.For his part, Mr. Johnson — I’m sorry. I just can’t do it. This movie was not screened for critics, and I should have taken the hint.“Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).Don’t get too excited.

Certainly the waterworks don’t need much plumbing, as might be expected when the 27-year-old Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a Seattle radio producer, learns that he has a malignant spinal tumor. Shock and grief and bewilderment ensue as do jokes about barbered testicles and the wisdom of playing the C (as in cancer) card with chicks.The wisenheimer coaxing those light laughs is Adam’s best friend, Kyle, played and sometimes bellowed by a shaggy Seth Rogen with his familiar mix of affability, innocence and vulgarity. As with most of Mr. Rogen’s characters, Kyle is really only guilty of coarse manners and of being a puppyish hound, which in the bromance world is a natural state of grace, close to a benediction. Like all bromance dudes, Kyle is the kind of decent guy that every other decent guy wants to have at his side, especially if the woman occupying that spot is as uptight as Adam’s girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). She paints abstract canvases and isn’t sexually giving, so you can guess where that’s headed.Most of the rest of the signposts are as obviously planted. Directed by Jonathan Levine (“The Wackness”), “50/50” was written by Will Reiser, who based it on his own experiences with spinal cancer. (He and Mr. Rogen became friends while working on the satiric television series “Da Ali G Show.” Mr. Reiser no longer has cancer.) When the story opens, Adam is settling into domesticity with Rachael (he’s cleared out a drawer for her in his apartment) and together with Kyle is working at a public radio station. The two men do toil — you see Adam briefly laboring over a story about a volcano — but their jobs mostly register as afterthoughts, narrative rationales for their cars and homes.A persistent pain in his back sends Adam to the doctor where he soon receives his grim diagnosis, his disbelief no match for the coolly delivered, frightening-sounding medical terms that rush over him like darkness. Within seconds he has crossed into the land of the sick, a place that the filmmakers try to portray with real, difficult feeling while also making it as cozy and finally unthreatening as possible. It’s a tough balancing act, one that Mr. Levine and Mr. Reiser struggle with as they — along with Kyle’s crude cutup and Adam’s tragic figure — keep toggling between the film’s genuinely funny bits and those interludes that grope toward scarier, heavier. Then Anna Kendrick , as Katherine, a 24-year-old therapist assigned to Adam, shows up and makes everything better.The likable Mr. Gordon-Levitt has a thousand ways to look unhappy, dejected, depressed, freaked out, wrung out and sick to his stomach, but there’s something so recessive about Adam, or rather underconceived, that the character never grabs you as hard as you expect and really need. The problem isn’t that he needs to win you over: the diagnosis and Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s natural appeal put you on Adam’s side readily enough. It’s that neither the actor nor the filmmakers can get under Adam’s skin, despite all the close-ups and the moodily shot scenes filled with the kind of movie silence that feels more like the groping of an uncertain screenwriter than of a man facing his mortality.That said, Mr. Gordon-Levitt keeps your sympathies, even when Adam enters wincing-relationship terrain with Rachael. (Ms. Howard improves with each performance but should be careful not to lock herself into shrewish type.) Rachael’s behavior doesn’t ring true, but unlike in some bromances, neither is she just another stick figure with breasts, and Ms. Howard makes a real character out of her. Other dividends include a very nice Anjelica Huston as Adam’s mother, the great Philip Baker Hall as a cancer-afflicted curmudgeon self-medicating with weed and, best of all, Ms. Kendrick (familiar as George Clooney’s foil in “Up in the Air”), an actress whose superb comic timing lifts the movie, and you.“50/50” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"Forget All That Stuff About Dirty, Dancing Is Downright Dangerous","Nobody can stop the youth of America from dancing, and nobody can stop the American film industry from making movies about people who try. The most impressive thing about Craig Brewer’s remake of “Footloose” — the 1984 Kevin Bacon movie with the Kenny Loggins theme song that will now be stuck in my cranium for another 27 years — is that it handles its shaky, shopworn premise with sensitivity and conviction.The elders of the little town of Bomont, Ga., have banned dancing (and loud music and a lot of other fun) not out of prudery, but as a result of misguided but understandable parental concern. After a wild night drinking beer and shaking their blue-jeaned tailfeathers to Blake Shelton’s new version of the theme song, a group of local teenagers were killed in a road accident. Among them was the only son of the Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid), who also has a daughter named Ariel (Julianne Hough).Three years later, Ariel is a high school senior running wild with a local racecar driver (Patrick John Flueger), and the town’s young people are sitting still and being quiet under the watchful eyes of the authorities, occasionally sneaking out for some clandestine toe tapping. Into this scene comes Ren (Kenny Wormald), who moves from the notoriously dance-crazy city of Boston to live with his uncle and aunt.If you remember the first “Footloose,” you know more or less what happens, and you may find some of the alterations amusing. Instead of a game of chicken on tractors, for instance, there is a dirt-track race involving modified school buses. Mr. Brewer films this lumbering action sequence, and several brawls and fights, with more verve and relish than he brings to the dance numbers, which are, in the age of “Glee,” the “High School Musical” movies and the mighty “Step Up” franchise, woefully inadequate.As is Mr. Wormald. He has energy but no real magnetism, and while he may be in possession of what are technically known as “moves,” his dancing lacks sensuality and a sense of release. Much better is Miles Teller, as Willard, Ren’s drawling sidekick — Mater to his Lightning McQueen, if you’ll permit a “Cars” reference. With his scarecrow limbs and slack features, Mr. Teller has a natural charisma that is both comic and kind of sexy.“Footloose” could use more of that, but Mr. Brewer’s expertise — as shown in his previous films, “Hustle & Flow” and “Black Snake Moan” — lies in pulpy vulgarity and florid melodrama. These elements certainly have a place in this movie, as does the director’s evident affection for the music and idioms of the South. Apart from the inevitable ’80s-throwback and popped-up hip-hop tracks, the music in this “Footloose” is better and more eclectic than the original, with some blues, country and vintage metal mixed in with the peppy dance tunes.But to be effective, a pop confection like this needs just the right mix of silliness and sincerity, so that you believe both that a lot is at stake in the battle over dancing and that, in the end, it’s really just dancing. Somehow “Footloose” never finds its rhythm. The maudlin scenes drag on, and the livelier moments pass by too quickly. It only works when it settles down and lets the characters (and the audience) hang out and have a little fun. Which is all kids really want to do. Why does everyone make it so difficult?“Footloose” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Dancing implies other vices and causes some conflict.FOOTLOOSEOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Craig Brewer; written by Mr. Brewer and Dean Pitchford, based on the original screenplay by Mr. Pitchford; director of photography, Amelia Vincent; edited by Billy Fox; music by Deborah Lurie; production design by Jon Gary Steele; costumes by Laura Jean Shannon; choreography by Jamal Sims; produced by Craig Zadan, Neil Meron, Dylan Sellers and Brad Weston; released by Paramount Pictures.

Given that this character spends most of his time whining that movies no longer matter, we are not shocked when his girlfriend (the dewy Kate Lyn Sheil) seeks diversion in the arms of the talented young horror director (Ti West, playing a version of himself) who has just awarded her the lead in his new werewolf project.So much for the plot, which, as expected, advances primarily through beer drinking, clothes shucking and aimless chatting. Though becoming more adventurous with his camera and editing this time out, Mr. Swanberg offsets those gains with a bloody finale of staggering self-pity. Whether this is a genuine move to ventilate real-life artistic despair, or simply self-indulgent posing, is impossible to determine; either way, the sequence feels wildly misjudged.Egged on by the hyperventilating strings of the Orange Mighty Trio and the familiar forehead of Larry Fessenden — who appears early in the film to no discernible purpose — “Silver Bullets” neither pleases the eye nor stimulates the mind. At one point Mr. Swanberg’s character announces that he couldn’t care less about getting good reviews. Whew, I feel so much better.",0,,,0

It asserts the group’s importance primarily through interviews with the members themselves and a handful of ardent fans (Liza Minnelli among them). But if the film doesn’t measure up as a piece of historical scholarship, it does manage to be a rather touching exploration of the troupe’s life cycle: achieving notoriety, then being torn apart by fame, then being destroyed by forces beyond its control.The group of 13 men favored cross-dressing or no dressing at all, performing raucous shows heavy with choreography. The many vintage clips of the troupe in action look like that of any gay cabaret you’d see today in New York, but this was Brazil in the ’70s, when a military government that favored censorship was in power. (The film isn’t entirely successful in explaining how Dzi Croquettes was allowed to exist.)“There was a whole movement around the show,” an actress named Lidoka says. “People began to dress like them, talk like them, love like them.”When the troupe traveled to France, celebrities discovered it. (“A black guy singing Jacques Brel dressed as a woman was something rare,” a film editor, Vera Memmi, recalls.) But later, back home, drugs and arguments took their toll. And then came AIDS, as well as some deaths by violent crime. Only five members remain.",0,,,0

(Believe me, it’s not.)When that magic moment arrives, oh-so-many stars converge in a downpour of confetti, although I must warn you that the “Jersey Shore” crowd and the Real Housewives are not among the chosen.In this cynical makeover of one of the most stressful nights of the year, no one is visibly drunk or shivering in the cold, and except for a few friendly officers, the police presence is minimal. In homage to V-J Day photos taken in Times Square, some of the kisses exchanged as the year changes are of the back-bending kind. Unctuous platitudes about its being a time of forgiveness and new beginnings regularly stall the movie in its tracks.“New Year’s Eve” was directed by Garry Marshall (best known for “Pretty Woman”) from a screenplay by Katherine Fugate. Last year the same team gave us the similarly unendurable “Valentine’s Day.” Like its forerunner, “New Year’s Eve” interweaves more than a half-dozen trivial subplots into a cheerlessly cheery mosaic. The screenplay isn’t written so much as assembled in carefully slotted little blocks, following the rules of a screenwriting textbook.The most dramatic fragment involves an electrical glitch in which the crystal sphere gets stuck during a trial run. If it isn’t fixed in time, Claire (Hilary Swank), the officious new vice president of the Times Square Alliance, will lose her job.Wan comedy is squeezed out of the competition between two couples for a $25,000 prize to be given to the pair that produces their hospital’s first baby of 2012. Meanwhile, a rock star, Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi), while preparing for a concert, is being punished by his former fiancée, Laura (Katherine Heigl), for having backed out of their commitment a year earlier. Mr. Bon Jovi can’t act but he offers decent performances of “I Can’t Turn You Loose” and “Have a Little Faith in Me.”Another cutesy piece involves Randy (Ashton Kutcher), a sarcastic comic-book artist who gets stuck in a stalled elevator with Elise (Lea Michele), one of Jensen’s backup singers whom he offends by asking her if she is a groupie. There is the tired story of Kim (Sarah Jessica Parker), an overprotective mom who refuses to let her 15-year-old daughter, Hailey (Abigail Breslin), go to Times Square to collect her first kiss from a dewy high school crush.The hunk factor is supplied by Sam (Josh Duhamel), whose highway mishap on the way to the city nearly prevents him from reuniting with a dream girl he met the previous New Year’s Eve; they promised to reconnect a year later at the same restaurant. But will she show up?This is an affair not to remember. It vies for the title of most fatuous subplot with the story of Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former assistant to a record company president, who strikes a deal with Paul (Zac Efron), a bike messenger. If he can make the impossible dreams on her wish list come true, she will give him her tickets to a New Year’s masked ball.“New Years Eve” visits Radio City Music Hall and the Queens Museum of Art. It brings in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Ryan Seacrest, and Frank Sinatra is heard singing “New York, New York.” The New Yorkers in this film are predominantly white, middle-to-upper-class Manhattanites, and there is no hardship in sight. The most prominent African-American is a selfless nurse (Halle Berry) who cares for Stan (Robert De Niro) a grizzled photojournalist dying of cancer. Stan’s final wish (I’m not kidding!) is to watch from a hospital roof as the ball drops.My advice: don’t believe the hype. Having been there — once — I would nominate Times Square as the last place on earth where most sensible people would want to be when the clock strikes midnight. At home asleep with your head under a pillow to blot out the noise is a much cozier alternative.“New Year’s Eve” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

That performer, whose name appears fairly low in the credits, surely deserves a higher berth, given the visceral impact her shoulder popping and back bending had on the audience I saw the movie with. The men around me all went, “Ew” — me, I wanted to head straight to yoga class.Directed by William Brent Bill, who wrote the script with Matthew Peterman, “The Devil Inside” opens with the promising laugh line that “the Vatican did not endorse this film nor aid in its completion.” It’s downhill from there, despite Pixie Le Knot’s Gumby physicality and some solid acting, including from Suzan Crowley as a mental patient, Maria Rossi, who may be possessed.The story turns on her daughter, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), who travels to Italy with a “documentary” filmmaker, Michael (Ionut Grama) to find out what’s, er, bedeviling mom. Years earlier, mommy scariest killed three religious functionaries who were trying to perform an exorcism on her, a splatterfest seen briefly and which led to her being locked up in an Italian institution.In Rome — the plane tickets were surely the costliest items in this production — Isabella attends a class at some kind of exorcism academy, where bright young things in clerical black discuss how to tell the difference between the mentally ill and the possessed. Two of the brightest are earnest, eager priests, Ben Rawlings (a good Simon Quarterman), and David Keane (Evan Helmuth, also rising above the occasion), who perform renegade exorcisms. They invite Isabella along to one, and she returns the favor, with more perilous results, by introducing them to her mother. Michael the filmmaker tags along, capturing all the shrieking, cursing, howling, body twisting and slamming with phony surveillance images and irritatingly palsied camerawork.The scariest thing about “The Devil Inside” is that a major studio like Paramount Pictures, which is distributing it, may be able to squeeze more profit out of a tedious, tediously exhausted subgenre that was already creatively tapped out when “The Blair Witch Project” spooked audiences more than a decade ago. (This movie was shown to critics only the night before it opened theatrically, probably to bypass reviews like this one.)Clearly, when a cheapie pickup like “Paranormal Activity,” which Paramount released a few years ago, turns into franchise gold, there’s just no stopping the banality. The first “Paranormal” cost about $10,000 to make and raked in more than $100 million domestically, which is why a fourth installment will be released this year.“The Devil Inside” is rated R.

O. SCOTT,"Hey, Brooklyn, Where’d You Get Those Muscles?","“Captain America: The First Avenger” turns out in the end — and this is really the opposite of a spoiler — to have been a two-hour teaser for another movie. That picture, foreshadowed in the second “Hulk,” the first “Thor” and both “Iron Man” episodes and scheduled to open next May, will be called “The Avengers.” Whether you regard its imminence with resignation, dread or uncontainable glee depends on your standing in the Marvel Universe. Shareholders and die-hard fans no doubt already have the opening date circled on their calendars, and many of the rest of us will probably show up as well, either out of curiosity or solemn duty.But in the meantime this origin story, directed by Joe Johnston and starring Chris Evans as the square-jawed, shield-throwing, red-white-and-blue Captain, is pretty good fun. The succinct judgment of my 15-year-old screening buddy was “Better than ‘Thor’ or ‘Green Lantern,’ ” and while that isn’t saying a lot, it may be saying enough. “Captain America,” based on a character that first appeared in Timely Comics, a precursor to Marvel, in the early 1940s — the era of Batman, Superman and other old-growth, popular-front superheroes — has a winningly pulpy, jaunty, earnest spirit.With a dusty color scheme that evokes newsprint and cheap ink, and a production design that captures the Deco-inflected futurism of an earlier time, the movie is nostalgic without making a big fuss about it. And though there are plenty of the usual digital enhancements and overscaled effects, the pseudo-operatic grandiosity that has become a staple of the genre is mostly missing. Instead “Captain America,” like its unapologetically corny hero, is propelled by unpretentious and plucky ingenuity.Some of this can be attributed to Mr. Johnston, whose affection for the pop culture of the past was charmingly displayed 20 years ago in “The Rocketeer.” (Subsequent, less charming credits include “Jurassic Park III” and “The Wolfman.”) “Captain America” is hardly groundbreaking in its mining and mixing of old pop culture motifs and real-life history — its hero fights Nazis in the shadow of not only his own earlier incarnations but also Indiana Jones — but its goal seems to be refreshment rather than reinvention. It is enjoyably preposterous, occasionally touching and generally likable.Unlike many of his peers, the Captain, alter ego of a scrawny “kid from Brooklyn” named Steve Rogers, is endowed with fairly modest powers. He is injected with a special serum that builds his muscles and improves his metabolism, a bit of juicing that today’s professional athletes might envy, since it is not accompanied by side effects or public disgrace.There is a wonderful scene in which Steve — who had previously been a slightly grotesque figure formed by superimposing Mr. Evans’s chiseled face onto the frame of a puny body double — tries out his new body in a shirtless pursuit of some minor bad guys. Mr. Evans, catching sight of his reflection in a store window as he runs past, and looking down at his arms and chest, registers the estrangement and delight that are part of every superhero’s self-discovery.He is even better when conveying the newly minted Captain’s dismay at being turned into a novelty act, sent out on the road with a line of chorus girls and a stage Hitler to sell war bonds. The montage of his tour, a tumble of peppy music and gee-whiz hamminess, may be the movie’s best sequence, a surprisingly witty and sincere exercise in post-postmodern self-referentiality. Before he has accomplished very much, Steve is a media-made hero, starring in comic books and serials intended to boost American morale.This makes him just like the real — which is to say the original, fictional — Captain America. He collides with reality (or at least with combat-movie-style realism) when an audience of G.I.’s in Italy fails to be impressed by his cartoon antics. But then the Captain, and the movie, zoom permanently back into the cartoon realm, springing into action to fight a villain so crazy and diabolical that he makes the Nazis uncomfortable.His name is Schmidt, he is played by the reliably sinister Hugo Weaving, and he is in possession of a magic Norse ice cube (or something) that makes him powerful enough to have a lot of weapons for Captain America to smash with his shield. Mr. Evans is genial and easy on the eyes, but a superhero with a mask, whether bland or brooding, is rarely as interesting as the sidekicks and baddies who surround him.Mr. Weaving, with a bright red, noseless face and a classic Hollywood “Chermann” accent, is a fine nemesis, and “Captain America” is well stocked with colorful supporting players. Among them are Tommy Lee Jones as a crusty Army officer; Stanley Tucci as an émigré scientist; Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, an important link to Robert Downey Jr. and the “Iron Man” franchise; and Toby Jones as the assistant bad guy.Captain America’s team includes Derek Luke, Neal McDonough and Ken Choi; his best pal is Sebastian Stan. The British actress Hayley Atwell, as Agent Carter, the hero’s love interest and supervisor, takes advantage of the opportunity to be more than just the Girl, though she is basically that. Mr. Johnston and the screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, clearly appreciate the snappy romantic chemistry of dames and fellas in the movies of the ’40s, and they also accommodate the modern expectation that a woman in an action movie should be able to throw a punch and handle a firearm.There is enough energy and imagination packed into “Captain America” to make you a bit sorry to see it all evaporate at the end. It might have been nice to be able to look forward to a few more sequels in the old, cheap, Saturday matinee style that the movie, at its best, pays tribute to, instead of another slick blockbuster. But progress is relentless, and superheroes can stay current only by changing with the times and synergizing their commercial powers.That was a challenge for Steve Rogers in the ’60s, when Marvel brought him out of retirement as an avatar of Greatest Generation values in a world of baby boomer alienation. It is nice, all these years later, to see him restored to his native time, and it’s also a little sad. “Captain America” is a reminder, at once successful and self-defeating, of the kind of fun that comics used to be.“Captain America” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of guns.CAPTAIN AMERICAThe First AvengerOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Joe Johnston; written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; director of photography, Shelly Johnson; edited by Jeffrey Ford and Robert Dalva; music by Alan Silvestri; production design by Rick Heinrichs; costumes by Anna B.

SCOTT,Review: ‘Logan Lucky’: Steven Soderbergh and His Motley Band of Thieves,"In American movies — and maybe not only there — the idea of luck often functions as a euphemism for, and an antidote to, the effects of class. In a land of winners and losers, where life is acknowledged to be unfair and positive thinking is all-powerful, we often find fault (or solace) not in our social structures but in our stars.“Logan Lucky,” Steven Soderbergh’s gravity-defying, ridiculously entertaining new film — one that ends a blessedly brief retirement from big-screen directing — concerns itself with a desperate attempt to even the odds. It’s a caper movie, a modern-day Robin Hood tale organized around an elaborate, improbable but curiously plausible heist. A gang that includes a wounded veteran, an unemployed former coal miner, a hairdresser and other motley members of the noncoastal nonelite conspires to knock over a Nascar race sponsored by Coca-Cola. The event sucks a lot of cash from people like them, and the thieves quite literally set out to suck it right back up.That description might make the movie sound more pointed than it is. But Mr. Soderbergh’s class consciousness — something that has popped up often in his career, in “Erin Brockovich” and “The Girlfriend Experience,” in “Bubble” and, of course, in “Magic Mike” — is atmospheric rather than programmatic. Nobody in “Logan Lucky” utters a political word, but the setting carries a heavy, obvious charge of political significance all the same. The Logans in question are proud, hard-pressed residents of West Virginia, a state that, in the real world, punches far above its demographic weight in partisan and symbolic importance. Their land is beautiful and their water is contaminated. The film’s anthem is John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a hillbilly elegy if ever there was one.Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), who plays the song for his young daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), while they work on his pickup truck, knows that its authenticity is questionable. Two of the credited writers, he says, had probably never even been to West Virginia when they hymned the beauty of its valleys and rivers. (“Logan Lucky,” it should probably be pointed out, was shot mostly in Georgia.) But Jimmy also knows that even pop-culture artifice can carry a spore of genuine sentiment, and Mr. Soderbergh shows a similar faith in the impure products of America. A student of movie traditions high and low, he draws his inspiration here less from the gritty, downbeat realism of ’70s New Hollywood than from that decade’s good-time populist genre hybrids. If the “Oceans” series represented his updating of Kennedy-era Rat Pack swagger, “Logan Lucky” revives the irreverent, hell-raising outlaw vibe of “Smokey and the Bandit.”Not that this movie feels in any way like a throwback. Mr. Tatum is about 10 times sexier than Burt Reynolds ever was, and about one-tenth as vain. Since his early screen appearances (in “Step Up” and “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints”), it’s been evident that he is a singularly charismatic performer, but by now it should be clear that he’s also a great actor. I think his appeal has less to do with any supposed Everyman quality (though every man can dream, of course) than with an uncanny ability to convey irony and sincerity in the same gesture, to balance his effortless magnetism with unforced modesty.Jimmy, once a high school football star, has not quite resigned himself to life on the short end of the stick. Laid off from a construction job in North Carolina, he returns home to discover that his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) and her car-dealer husband (David Denman) are planning to move out of West Virginia with Sadie. Jimmy’s brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost a hand in Iraq, thinks the family is cursed. Jimmy doesn’t share this superstition, and in any case he has a plan, or at least a how-to list for bank robbers that he decides to adapt for new circumstances.Like George Clooney’s Danny Ocean, he needs, first of all, to put together a crew. Starting with Clyde and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), Jimmy taps into another kinship network, recruiting an explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson). That’s not quite everyone, but there are some dandy little surprises in store that I’m not inclined to spoil.Not that the plot is anything earth-shakingly original. “Logan Lucky” sticks to the “Oceans” template so faithfully that someone makes a joke about it. Who cares? The pleasures of the heist genre are always procedural and specific. These movies are all the same, but also always different because of the particular mix of personalities and circumstances. What they celebrate, above all, is the combination of craft, planning and problem-solving ingenuity that can turn a job of work into a work of art. They are, in other words, the quintessential movie movies, reflecting the collaborative challenges and logistical triumphs of the production cycle.For that reason, a good heist movie can settle into a sweet spot where reality and fantasy converge. This one’s narrative engine hums along nicely, occasionally accelerating into farce, usually when Mr. Craig shows up, sporting neck tattoos, spiky bleached hair and an accent that sounds like the cause or the result of a badly sprained tongue. (The dialects are all over the map, but let’s not get too hung up on authenticity.)Mr. Soderbergh never speeds through the twists and bumps. He downshifts and pulls onto the shoulder, letting the story take care of itself while the audience enjoys the sometimes funny, sometimes fractious, sometimes wistful pleasure of the characters’ company. By the time you encounter Hilary Swank’s F.B.I. agent, or figure out that the obnoxious British energy-drink mogul who is the only truly villainous character is Seth MacFarlane, you feel like you’re a family-reunion crasher who stuck around long enough to get promoted to second cousin.Of the three movies released this summer that self-consciously reactivate an old-school outlaw mythology — the others are Edgar Wright’s “Baby Driver” and Josh and Benny Safdie’s “Good Time” — this one has the most to say and the least to prove. Whereas the other directors aggressively promote their own coolness, flaunting borrowed attitudes and showy retrofitted styles, Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness, and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. “Logan Lucky” is a terrific movie. That’s a matter of skill, and maybe also of luck. But mostly it’s a matter of generosity.",1,27696504.0,27778642.0,1

Much of its effectiveness, obviously, depends upon the readiness of one's mind to fill in the remembrance of emotions of the period, but that is legitimate.There is inordinate irony, for instance, in beholding a pale, deflated Goering in the dock, his face drawn and his eyes apprehensive as a prosecutor cites his monstrous crimes, and then to see him strutting in bloated triumph in earlier newsreel shots. Or there is horror in seeing the other Nazi murderers and slave-traders, haggard and twitching with terror, against the photographic evidence of their deeds—familiar scenes of slaughtered bodies, displaced persons and ruined towns.Actually, no new information or interpretation is contained in the film, and its principal contribution is a display of human justice working out. In this, it is grimly gratifying and supports the commentator's early remark that it presents a ""philosophical lesson of history—a lesson which future aggressors in the world would do well to heed.""The commentary is spoken in English and, except for an obvious partiality toward the Soviets among the prosecutors and a predominance of reference to the victimization of the Russians during the war, the film might have been assembled by competent craftsmen of any of the Allies.THE NUREMBERG TRIALS, a documentary record of the trial of Germany's top war criminals; produced by R.

Then there’s the proprietor of a coffee shop who can’t seem to keep his mind on his business, and a server at said coffee shop, who may or may not be the proprietor’s mistress — but who definitely has an amorous interest in the playwright.The setup and characters are a little reminiscent of a film by the Korean anatomist of bad romance Hong Sang-soo. But this isn’t any such thing.“Wet Woman in the Wind,” directed by Akihiko Shiota, is more concerned with sex than sexual neuroses. The movie is one of several recent postmodern reboots of what has been called “roman porno,” a subgenre of erotic cinema that was very popular in Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. These were cheaply made soft-core pictures that could get away with a lot of aesthetic quirkiness, on account of also featuring images of half-naked women like clockwork. Nikkatsu, the studio that pioneered the form, is now commissioning new films as a kind of cheeky self-homage.But let’s make no bones about it: This is a film designed to appeal to straight male prurient interest. Yuki Mamiya, who plays Shiori, the title character, has a smoldering quality that fills the bill. Much less winning is the way the movie treats consent, as in the playwright’s rough “seduction” of a very young fan. Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off — and worse. Perhaps the “roman porno” reboot project should have rebooted its sexual politics before calling “action!”",0,,,0

Hiding out, he takes a job alongside a cousin, a farmworker named Hassan (Mahmoud El Bezawi). Hassan’s boss, Mourad (Zaki Faten), a respected landowner, seems decent enough at first: He allows Ali to stay. But he also counts on total subservience.Complicating the claustrophobic arrangement is the fact that Hassan has married Ali’s old flame, Fatma (Nahed El Sebai). She still longs for Ali, a strapping, handsome contrast to her kind but ineffectual husband, while the oblivious Hassan tries to arrange a marriage for his cousin.What follows combines a bit of James M. Cain and a bit of “Macbeth” — and more than a bit of topicality, since the events in the film, though they unfold away from Cairo, overlap with the Tahrir Square demonstrations of 2011. (The revolution weighs heavily on the wealthy Mourad and divides him politically from his children.)But the movie is somewhat labored and repetitive as a piece of screenwriting, spelling out motivations when the power of suggestion might go further, and its purported allegorical dimensions don’t come across clearly. No doubt subtleties have been lost in translation, but the film is best viewed as an overripe, noir-tinged tragedy.",0,,,0

Mariam Shaar leads a modest food business in Bourj el Barajneh, a refugee camp south of Beirut, Lebanon, comprising decrepit buildings, narrow alleys and a dangerous overhead mishmash of electrical wires. Despite her status as a Palestinian — barred, as with Syrian refugees, from better jobs in Beirut — Ms. Shaar grows her company, Soufra (which means a table of delicious plenty), with other women struggling to transcend their social station.Crisply directed by Thomas Morgan, the film depicts a succession of challenges facing Ms. Shaar, a smart, understated and tenacious entrepreneur. Soufra begins as a company that races to raise Kickstarter money (with assistance from the Saudi philanthropical concern Alfanar), then expands into schools, upscale gatherings and a farmer’s market, and finally into a food truck, the acquisition of which provides much of the movie’s tension. Fortunately, Ms, Shaar has resourceful and engaged helpers — including the good-humored Ghada Masrieh and diligent Abeer Hassan Almassry — who share her determination and persistence. “You realize your worth,” says Manal Hassan, a mother of five, of working for Soufra. “Especially in these times, women can do anything.”After an initial rejection, Ms. Shaar waits — and waits and waits — for government licenses to purchase the truck, and we see not only the prejudice facing Palestinians in Beirut but also those facing women in particular. Still, she persists, learning to drive, buying culinary technology for the vehicle, and establishing a stand. Ultimately, Ms. Shaar’s triumphs seem boundless.",1,,,1

Levine and Landon Van Soest, grew out of a People magazine article from 2011 about the Innovative Concept Academy, an alternative school in St. Louis designed to rehabilitate teenagers who might otherwise be incarcerated. The film follows one such student over about two years.The movie begins with Daje Shelton, known as Boonie, then 17, visiting a courtroom after a school fight. The judge, Jimmie M. Edwards, who opened the academy, tells her that he will decide whether to lock her up. The alternative school is her last option for getting a high school diploma, he says. She won’t be able to attend other public schools in Missouri.“For Ahkeem” trails Boonie as she tries to graduate. It’s not clear that she will pass the necessary coursework. Her apparent apathy toward school seems, in part, like the product of a bleak upbringing filled with poverty and street violence. She casually rattles off the names of dead friends (“too many to count”). Boonie also has a boyfriend, which leads to complications that shouldn’t be spoiled.The filming period coincided with the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him. The protests are mainly a backdrop to Boonie’s story, though. While the film ends at a logical stopping point, it feels incomplete. It probably could have used a few more years of filming.",0,,,0

Otherwise, there's little appeal to this romantic comedy’s protagonist, a man so unlikable the movie opens with an M.P.A.A.-style warning for the character’s sexism, homophobia and machismo.Raúl (Mauricio Ochmann) is a walking prehistoric machista — a man who thinks he has the right to cheat on his pregnant wife and act disgusted at the slightest homoerotic gesture. But after his best friend (Alfonso Dosal) breaks off his engagement to Raúl’s sister (Aislinn Derbez) and comes out to his friends, Raúl is at a loss for words. Fortunately, everyone else in the movie seems unmoved by the news. Unfortunately, we’re stuck with Raúl.Of course, there are intolerant people everywhere, but Nicolás López’s movie isn’t clever enough to make its lead character sympathetic or multidimensional, only more insufferable. The movie asphyxiates on tired jokes about anal sex, dropping the soap in the shower and a transgender prostitute. Aside from references to hookup apps and hipsters, there's little in Mr. López and Guillermo Amoedo’s outdated script that doesn’t seem like it was written 20 years ago.The movie flouts its intolerance in an attempt at provocative humor.

What unsupervised time they have is spent crashing on each other’s couches, playing video games, and identifying crushes from their yearbooks, and if Zach seems a little more handsome, a little more sociable, a little less nerdy than his friend, it’s the kind of difference in temperament that might have gone unacknowledged forever. But when Zach and Josh find themselves involved in a horrific accident that claims the life of a friend, the underlying tensions between the boys are stretched thin by guilt, panic and paranoia.The performances from the film’s young cast members are uniformly excellent, including Owen Campbell as Zach and Charlie Tahan as Josh. But the direction from Mr. Phillips is what makes “Super Dark Times” unusual. In the movie’s scenes of violence, in particular, what we hear complicates what we see, as the impact of blunt physical trauma mixes with the film’s score to suggest the psychic magnitude of accidental violence. While another movie might have leaned harder on ripped-from-the-headlines prurience, “Super Dark Times” instead aims to become a more elusive pleasure — a simple story, well told.",0,29759.0,33109.0,0

That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” and later for many years on “Hollywood Squares.” In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her — and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.",0,,,0

The persona she creates on the page is always frank but never ingratiating.So it’s disarming to see a relatively cozy Joan Didion in the documentary “Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,” but it should not be surprising. The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne, one of Ms. Didion’s nephews, who also appears as an onscreen interviewer. The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are, and have been, significant cultural forces. They are also a clan rived by tragedy. Two of Ms. Didion’s most celebrated recent works concern the deaths of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and her daughter, Quintana Roo.The exchanges between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion are at once fond and candid. When Mr. Dunne suggests that his uncle, Ms. Didion’s husband, was a “protector,” Ms. Didion nods animatedly before adding, “And a hothead.”The relationship between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion limits the movie in certain ways, but opens it up in others. Mr. Dunne’s longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule. Ms. Didion’s friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees, and while I’d never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get, I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up.While the movie covers the whole of Ms. Didion’s life (and even the period before it, offering a fun fact that at one point the pioneer Didions traveled with the Donner party), those expecting a thorough examination of Ms. Didion’s work may be disappointed. Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne, a very canny filmmaker, doesn’t accomplish a lot via implication. The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didion’s appreciation of John Wayne, in an early essay, and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a later one. Unlike a great many more facile thinkers, Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures. But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didion’s thinking over the years.Her early writing reveals the instincts of a conservative. As she witnessed the tectonic shifts in American life wrought by, among other things, the counterculture, she admittedly lost faith in “the social contract,” but did not turn left for solutions; rather, she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider. (Two words that are never uttered in this movie are “feminism” and “feminist.”) Mr. Dunne’s movie gets you thinking about all this with extremely well-chosen archival footage and evocative music choices.The movie’s title, like that of Ms. Didion’s collection “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” is derived from the W.B. Yeats poem “The Second Coming.” Mr. Dunne’s portrait and tribute to his aunt, now 82, also reminded me of an observation by D.H. Lawrence: “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically.” Ms. Didion’s triumph, as a writer and a human being, has been to take the age for what it is, to pinpoint how she saw it, and to stick it out.",1,,,0

Mr. Ford had gone there after a dispute over a repair and confronted Mr. Reilly about an insult that was said to have been made earlier to Mr. Ford’s mother. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Reilly, a decision that staggered Mr. Ford’s loved ones.Though questions of race and justice are raised, Yance Ford more often examines how he and the rest of his middle-class family dealt, or refused to deal, with the tragedy. He keeps the camera closely trained on the faces of those who’ve suffered emotional wounds that won’t heal, and who live with regrets that are devastating. That includes himself.The effect is intense and elegiac, even as the pace veers toward the overly deliberate, and as Mr. Reilly and some essential witnesses aren’t interviewed or approached by the filmmaker; no explanation for this omission is given.Were “Strong Island” a strict procedural, that exclusion would be more glaring. Yet this potent film gives equal weight to complex emotions as well as bare facts. In the same way, it’s not just the story of a man’s death, but also a study of the aftermath.",0,,,0

That’s no surprise given that cinema confers a kind of immortality on performers even if, as parades of tragically frozen faces attest, it can get confusing for the real people on camera. In Billy Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard,” Norma Desmond so deeply embodies this confusion that she punctuates a banal observation with a pitiful question: “Stars are ageless — aren’t they?” Norma may be a Hollywood tragedy, but the movie brilliantly proves that she’s got the ageless part right.In “The Age of Adaline,” Blake Lively plays the title character, a woefully under-conceptualized gimmick who, after a strange car accident — lightning flash, a cold bath, some narrated mumbo-jumbo — stops aging. Adaline becomes forever 29, but, like a few vampires, knows that immortality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Because while her clock stopped ticking in 1937, time kept on marching, of course, taking with it various loved ones, including a line of Cavalier dogs. By the time the present rolls around, Adaline has become an emotional shut-in. Her closest companion, outside the latest Cavalier, is her daughter, Flemming, who’s played by Ellen Burstyn, who in turn played a woman who rises as a Christ-like healer after a car accident in “Resurrection” (1980).What comes around goes around — gods, people, intimations of immortality. Adaline, alas, isn’t resurrected with any special talents (not aging is more burden than gift for her, and certainly not an aptitude); the problem with this movie is that she isn’t resurrected with much of a personality, either.Best known for the television show “Gossip Girl” and her red-carpet appearances, Ms. Lively has done some fine work elsewhere, including in “The Town” and especially “Savages.” Here, though, she delivers a muted, largely opaque performance, an unfortunate choice given that Adaline shows few signs of having lived through two world wars, the space age, the Beatles, the invention of the pill, the civil rights movement, second-wave feminism, punk rock or, really, anything at all.The filmmakers try to insist that time weighs heavily on Adaline, but there’s little in J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz’s script that suggests that the years have left her with much more than an expansive wardrobe and a knack for both languages and Trivial Pursuit. Far too often here, Adaline’s parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience. The director Lee Toland Krieger is good with actors, especially in the expression of a low-key, unforced intimacy. And the movie features some very nice performances, including from Michiel Huisman, who plays Ellis, the equivalent of the modern prince charming (a.k.a. a tech millionaire), and a touching Harrison Ford as William, a mystery man who gives the story tears and heft.Best of all, though, is the underused Ms. Burstyn, who makes her every scene pop. Flemming is brought in after a newsreel-style recap of Adaline’s life in one of the movie’s smartest, most effective and meaningful interludes. Adaline, for reasons that never really make sense, is on the verge of moving out of San Francisco, something she does every 10 years. The two women meet at a restaurant where, facing off in a booth, they rapidly assume their respective roles after Adaline maternally chides Flemming for using too much salt on her food. It’s a familiar routine, and lovely. All at once, Ms. Burstyn, with just a few bobs of her head, a whine creeping into her voice and not an iota of digital help, transforms into a petulant adolescent. It’s the most magical scene in the movie.“The Age of Adaline” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There’s a sad visit to a vet.",0,,42629776.0,0

All this is fado.”Ms. Rodrigues, who died in 1999, was known as the Queen of Fado, but she has a number of  majestic heirs, some of whom perform with tremendous force and feeling in “Fados,” Carlos Saura’s big-screen film about the musical genre. Much as he did in his 1990s documentaries “Sevillanas” and “Flamenco,”  this  veteran Spanish director has, in his latest, created both a tribute to an art form and  a performance archive. Set entirely inside a cavernous soundstage subdivided by large panels, some of which periodically do double time as projection screens, the film has a pleasurably easy if  on occasion somewhat  slack rhythm that can feel at odds with the intense pulse and temperament of the actual fados.The film jumps to rousing life, though, with a choreographed cavalcade as performers of different hues, ages and sexes — some blowing whistles, other banging drums — march and dance into the soundstage in a nod to the early Brazilian and African influences on fado. Largely thought to have emerged from several poor quarters in Lisbon in the early 19th century, fado was a song of the demimonde. Its first legendary figure, a 19th-century tavern singer, Maria Severa, was  known as much for her love affairs and black shawls as for her songs and is thought, like so many other female martyrs from  art of that era, to have died of (what else?) tuberculosis or suicide. Verdi would have loved her.To judge from the film, contemporary fadistas (the word is used for men and women) are very much in touch not just with the genre as a musical tradition but also as a form of melodramatic self-expression. When a fadista like Mariza, one of the most renowned modern interpreters of fado, performs, she stretches out her arms and moves her hips seductively,  beckoning with her body as well as with her voice. She’s a rather pallid figure when compared with Ms. Rodrigues —closer to Annie Lennox than to Édith Piaf — but her throaty vibrato suggests layers of feeling. Like some of the other younger performers in the film, including a few rappers, she has helped usher fado out of Portugal and its past and into the world.Mr. Saura has given the film a distinctly historical arc, notably by showcasing both musicians and dancers who look back at the past even as they move fado forward, but this trajectory may be better appreciated by those familiar with 20th-century Portuguese history. The lack of both a voice-over and reams of text of the sort that often accompanies documentaries certainly makes it easier to concentrate on the performances, but it also means that the uninitiated might miss fado’s  deep cultural and political importance. The  longtime Portuguese dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar, for instance, who ruled from 1932 to 1968, is said to have controlled the country with the so-called three F’s: fado, futebol and Fátima (a reference to the Roman Catholic shrine). He apparently wasn’t a fan of Ms. Rodrigues.This is more a regret  than a strong criticism: above all, “Fados” is a celebration of human expressivity that, with a stripped-down soundstage and some extraordinary bodies, allows you to appreciate how emotion becomes art. And while I would have preferred a little less interpretive dancing,  there is no quarreling with a film that includes a recognizable world-music star like Caetano Veloso and the lesser-known Ricardo Ribeiro. Mr. Ribeiro, a formidably sized young man with a stirring tenor, appears late in the film to perform a kind of duel with the singer Pedro Moutinho while accompanied by four guitarists who pluck as fast as a hummingbird beats its wings.  Each man begins singing while seated, only rising to stand  as the notes of the fado lift him higher.FADOSOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Carlos Saura; based on an original idea by Ivan Dias; directors of photography, José Luis López-Linares and Eduardo Serra; edited by Julia Juaniz; production designer, Carlos Saura; produced by Mr. Dias, Luis Galvão Teles and Antonio Saura; released by New Yorker Films.

And that much is made clear in “Mr. Gaga,” Tomer Heymann’s documentary about his life and work, which opens with Mr. Naharin’s instructing a dancer on how to fall to the floor after simulating a seizure of sorts. His dissatisfaction is palpable, yet his terse directives begin to seem contradictory. He wants the dancer to be conscious of what she’s doing, but also to fall naturally. Despite expending much effort, she is showing her boss exactly what he doesn’t want to see.All I could think about was how bruised her side was going to be. Mr. Naharin, however, is not a sadist. As years of rehearsal and performance footage demonstrate, Mr. Naharin, leader of the Batsheva Dance Company, based in Tel Aviv, doesn’t ask his dancers to do anything that he wouldn’t do himself, or subject them to anything he wouldn’t put himself through.ImageThe choreographer Ohad Naharin.CreditGadi Dagon/AbramoramaThe film’s title, “Mr. Gaga,” may bring to mind a certain pop star, but it is actually derived from a dance language Mr. Naharin developed over the years, one he is shown demonstrating to nondancers of varying ages and abilities. The practice was born from Mr. Naharin’s long-held conviction that “physical pleasure from physical activity was part of being alive.” Later, he talks about applying the principle of “connecting effort and pleasure” to his choreography.Mr. Naharin is an intriguing figure. But “Mr. Gaga” is a scattered and somewhat confused film. It tells a love story, that of Mr. Naharin and his first wife, Mari Kajiwara, whom he met when she was dancing in New York for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and who died in 2001. It tells of a late-’90s controversy in Israel in which Mr. Naharin resigned, with his troupe, from a performance commemorating the country’s 50th anniversary after a conflict over his company’s costuming.But in between strong vignettes, it presents portions of Mr. Naharin’s work willy-nilly; the archival dance footage is often murky, and the newly shot dances are captured with little imagination or energy. The filmmakers’ disinclination to contextualize Mr. Naharin’s sometimes prickly personality is also bothersome. A more finely focused treatment would have made a much better summation of, or introduction to, Mr. Naharin’s work.",0,173994.0,,0

Johnson) is snatched by drug dealers. Or, more precisely, by guys who work for the guy (Dermot Mulroney) who works for the main drug dealer (Scoot McNairy). Vincent and his partner, Sean (T.I.), have stolen 25 kilos of cocaine for reasons as murky as the movie’s nighttime cinematography. Vincent tries to return it, but his plans are complicated by the doggedness of an internal affairs officer named Jennifer Bryant (Michelle Monaghan). She has a partner (David Harbour, a walking spoiler alert). Vincent has an ex-wife (Gabrielle Union, deserving better in every way).At the beginning, Jennifer and Vincent are shown with matching cuts on their cheekbones. By the end, they will both be much bloodier. Vincent, stabbed in the gut when his son is taken, will be battered with hotel-kitchen utensils and other weapons during a long and hectic night at a dimly-lighted casino.“Sleepless,” directed by Baran bo Odar, sets a low bar for itself, and then trips over it. What audiences want — what we deserve — from a movie like this isn’t greatness, but competence. Reasonably exciting chases and fights; characters with at least minimal credibility; performances with a measure of wit, flair or intensity. Instead we get muttering and glowering from Mr. Foxx, a story that can’t manage enough twists to tie a shoelace, and set pieces that have been done better in other movies.

Sort Of.,"“Preggoland,” a mild comedy about a fake pregnancy, has some rewards, though you have to be prepared to give it a chance. The central character, Ruth, initially comes across as irritating. By the end, though, the actress who plays her, Sonja Bennett, has made her likably irritating.Ruth, single and childless and irresponsible, hangs out with old pals who have all begun to have children. She is increasingly unwelcome among them, and she feels like an outcast in her family as well, since her father (James Caan) is eager for grandchildren.A mistaken assumption leads Ruth to pretend that she is pregnant, and suddenly she finds herself pampered by her pals, at home, at work, even on public transit. The movie makes some good comedy out of the ever-evolving lie and Ruth’s angst over how to undo it. Danny Trejo is especially amusing as Ruth’s co-worker, who learns her secret and forms a collaborative bond with her.The movie’s flaw is that it mixes tones. Ruth, her relatives and her fellow workers are realistically played, but her gal-pal buddies are caricatures. It’s as if Ms. Bennett, who also wrote the script, didn’t trust her own idea or comic sensibility, and the director, Jacob Tierney, doesn’t find a way to synthesize things.Ms. Bennett’s own character, at least, is believable enough for a lighthearted farce. There are a few decent laughs before the plot spins out of control.",0,,,0

Mr. Murphy plotted its demise carefully. Shrink supply, he knew, and demand is stoked. Announce your funeral, and it can fill Madison Square Garden.That’s exactly what happened on April 2, 2011, when the band played its sold-out final concert there, an affair documented in the lavish and inconsequential documentary “Shut Up and Play the Hits.”Mr. Murphy’s decision can’t help being read as a defense against a natural, insignificant death, a forestalling of one’s mortality. This was a controlled way to end a career and a hubristic way of pulling the trigger, rooted in the belief that the funeral would be worth attending. And filming.The corpse, as it happens, was beautiful. Directed by Will Lovelace and Dylan Southern, “Shut Up” is graceful in its depiction of the performance, neither uncomfortably intimate nor shy. It’s the rare concert film that goes out of its way not to flaunt the size of the audience — most of the camerawork is up close, emphasizing details that many there would have missed, giving it the feel of a small-room performance or a conversation among friends (though there are some impressive overhead shots of the crowd vibrating like testy electrons).Mr. Murphy and his bandmates and guests don’t do much onstage, so the weight of the film often falls on the concert’s sound, which, as mixed by Mr. Murphy, has an intense physicality to it, crisper than it was in the building that night. (As Mr. Murphy might put it, I was there.)Even though sound is the best weapon available to them, the directors make efforts to elevate “Shut Up” beyond a traditional concert film: interview segments with the journalist Chuck Klosterman, footage of Mr. Murphy in and around his apartment the morning after the show. But they’re scant and largely empty.Mr. Murphy comes off as an amiably rumpled gentleman — whether in a tux onstage at the Garden, or in pajama bottoms and slippers, walking his dog — who is more content to be on camera than to speak to one. Mr. Klosterman, who writes the Ethicist column for The New York Times Magazine, often has more to say than he does.There’s little here about Mr. Murphy’s motivation to do what he did, little (apart from meaningful facial expressions) about how his colleagues felt about it. There is, however, an inordinately long scene of him shaving his beard down to stubble the morning after the show while, in voice-over, he discusses pretentiousness: It’s dull first, funny second.A scene in which Mr. Murphy weeps while surveying the band’s gear the day after the concert is meant to be the film’s catharsis, but it’s cold, and it’s such an emotional outlier that it feels staged.“Shut Up” originally hit theaters for a one-night engagement last week and is now returning for a longer run, but not too long — another constrained supply cycle. Like the concert itself, it’s an event designed for the consumption of just a few, now available for the consumption of many more, a sly way to create demand just to have the chance to fulfill it.But why stop now? Forget the false modesty and give this documentary the fate it deserves: a regular midnight screening in Williamsburg, every Friday night for eternity. Bands die, but demand glows eternal.",0,,345000.0,1

Adapted by Pedro Rivero and Alberto Vázquez from Mr. Vázquez’s graphic novel, the film, originally called “Psiconautas” (“Psychonauts”), conjures a bleak vision of a post- or perhaps mid-apocalyptic landscape of predation, addiction and demonic possession. So maybe it’s actually the perfect children’s entertainment for 2017.Birdboy is a creature with an enormous round head and a tiny beak who dresses in a black suit, white shirt and skinny tie, like a member of the “Reservoir Dogs” cast or of an ’80s ska revival band. The lighthouse he once called home is infested by demonic birds, so he flaps around looking for drugs and trying not to get shot.The island where he and the other animals live has been blighted by a nuclear accident. The trees are bare, and the population is divided between a countryside of tidy houses, forests and open fields, and an industrial zone heaped with refuse and ruled by the law of the jungle. Life is pretty awful for everyone. Dinky, who is more or less the heroine of the story (and turns out to be Birdboy’s former girlfriend), quietly seethes in the company of her grotesque mother and stepfather. Her schoolmate Sandra is tormented by voices in her head. Their friend Little Fox is bullied.A lot of incident is packed into a 76-minute running time, giving “Birdboy” the scale of a miniature epic. It’s a little too much, and especially toward the end, the delicate originality of the imagery gives way to familiar movie tropes. (The final moments jarringly evoke “Avatar,” of all things.) But the simple precision of the hand-drawn characters and of the watercolor world they inhabit provide visual coherence and establish an atmosphere of fascination as well as dread. The movie is an anthology of nightmares compressed into a picture book.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,"Review: &#8216;Tomorrowland,&#8217; Brad Bird&#8217;s Lesson in Optimism","My son briefly had a youth baseball coach whose way of inspiring his demoralized players was to stand at the dugout entrance screaming at them to have fun. “Tomorrowland,” Brad Bird’s energetic new film, a shiny live-action spectacle from Disney, reminds me of that guy. There is nothing casual or whimsical about this movie’s celebration of imagination, optimism and joy. On the contrary: It’s a determined and didactic argument in favor of all those things, and an angry indictment of everyone who opposes them.Just who that might be is an interesting question. The answers proposed by Mr. Bird and Damon Lindelof, his screenwriting collaborator, run the usual gamut: politics, bureaucracy, greed, bad teachers, dumb parents, a villain with a long black coat and a British accent. Mostly, though, the fault lies with humanity itself. We are wonderful creatures, capable of dazzling feats of invention and problem-solving, but we have a damnable tendency to get in our own way, to sell out and sell ourselves short.In the past 50 years or so, according to the “Tomorrowland” timeline, we’ve succumbed to pessimism. Where we used to look to the future with hope and excitement, we now embrace decline and futility. Everything’s falling apart, and instead of making it better, most of us just wallow in gloom, especially when it comes to entertainment. A billboard advertises something called “ToxiCosmos 3,” and to those of us who groove on such visions of apocalypse and catastrophe, Mr. Bird has a message: Cut it out! To those of us who can conceive something better, the message is: Wake up and start dreaming!There are some logical — and, I dare say, some ideological — contradictions here, and a more serious problem of tone. The filmmakers want to dazzle you, but they also want to teach you a lesson. In 1965, young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson, who will grow up to be George Clooney) arrives at the New York World’s Fair with a big grin and a cool invention. It’s a jetpack made out of an old vacuum cleaner, and while it doesn’t quite fly, Frank figures that his hard work and can-do spirit will impress the dour judge (Hugh Laurie, earmarked for his subsequent bad-guy role) in the inventors’ pavilion. Asked what the use of his contraption is, Frank replies that it’s for fun, which is its own kind of utility. If people see that such a thing can exist, they’ll be inspired. They’ll believe in their own capacities, and in the general possibility of good stuff.That’s an excellent defense of creativity, and of the value of art, but it’s a defense that is advanced so bluntly and insistently that it gets in the way of the actual art. At the World’s Fair, Frank develops a crush on Athena (Raffey Cassidy), a girl, gray-eyed like her namesake goddess, who is (to keep the comparisons within the boundaries of the Disney universe) a perfect blend of Mary Poppins and Tinker Bell. Athena hands Frank a pin that is his ticket to Tomorrowland, a place founded by some of history’s greatest geniuses as a combination Utopian community, R&D lab and “Atlas Shrugged” theme park. Later, in our own time, a similar pin will come into the possession of Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), a teenager whose irrepressible gumption is expressed through acts of sabotage at the NASA launch platform near her home in Cape Canaveral, Fla. She is motivated not by hostility to the space program — which used to employ her dad (Tim McGraw) as an engineer — but rather by rage that celestial exploration is being abandoned. She wants to halt the dismantling of the facility, a wonderfully futile gesture that marks her as a potential savior of Tomorrowland and a new recruit for Plus Ultra, the secret club of artists and smarties who populate it. She, too, meets Athena, and they fight off some nasty robots on the way to find Frank, now exiled from Tomorrowland and living out his days as a grizzled crank (i.e., as George Clooney) in a ramshackle house equipped with amazing gizmos.I was tempted to affix a little trademark sign to the word “amazing” there. The effects in “Tomorrowland” fall short of that standard, but part of Casey’s job is to serve as a kind of on-screen shill, cuing the desired audience response by exclaiming “Whoa, that’s amazing!” or “Wow, incredible!” at regular intervals. And while some of the images are interesting, even startling — a visit to the Eiffel Tower, for instance — the action is more frantic than thrilling and the sense of wonder rarely materializes.It gives me no pleasure at all to report this. I yield to no one in my admiration for Mr. Bird’s animated Pixar features — “The Incredibles” and especially “Ratatouille,” for my money one of the finest movies ever made about the pursuit of artistic excellence. And it’s important to note that “Tomorrowland” is not disappointing in the usual way. It’s not another glib, phoned-in piece of franchise mediocrity but rather a work of evident passion and conviction.What it isn’t is in any way convincing or enchanting. Mr. Clooney is wry and gruff, and then earnest and amiable, in a role that dozens of actors could have played. Ms. Robertson is perky and panicky in the same way. Among the characters only Athena has any real distinction, and Ms. Cassidy is an intriguing performer, funny and a little scary in her composure. Everyone else, Mr. Laurie included (and Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key partly excepted), would be better as a cartoon.To some extent, that goes for the whole movie. Its enormous lapses in narrative and conceptual coherence — its blithe disregard for basic principles of science-fiction credibility — would be less irksome in the fantastical cosmos of animation. And it would look better, too. Tomorrowland looks less like a magical city of the future, or even the Disney environment it’s meant to evoke, than like an unusually clean and efficient airport, or the shopping mall beyond the multiplex where you’re seeing the movie. Perhaps “Tomorrowland” should not be blamed for succumbing to the poverty of vision it works so hard to attack. Maybe the forces of negativity are just too strong. But it’s also possible that the movie is confused about how to imagine and oppose those forces. False cheer can be just as insidious as easy despair. And the world hardly suffers from a shortage of empty encouragement, of sponsored inducements to emulate various dreamers and disrupters, of bland universal appeals to the power of individuality. “Tomorrowland” works entirely at that level, which is to say in the vocabulary of advertisement. Its idea of the future is abstract, theoretical and empty, and it can only fill in the blank space with exhortations to believe and to hope. But belief without content, without a critical picture of the world as it is, is really just propaganda. “Tomorrowland,” searching for incitements to dream, finds slogans and mistakes them for poetry.“Tomorrowland” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

As Dennis, the movie’s emphatically noncuddly title character, Mr. Kold has a diffident manner that appears at odds with his outrageous physical size and his character’s expert exhibitionism. A hulking contradiction tucked under a stratum of ropy muscle, his Dennis is at once massive and passive, as big as a house and shy as a mouse. He needs to roar.First he needs to deal with his mother, Ingrid (Elsebeth Steentoft), a wisp of a woman with sharp features and a bitter affect. A tiny, proud beauty, Ingrid lords over the small, drab house she shares with Dennis, her only child. The two live in a colorless quarter outside of Copenhagen, but they also bicker and overshare in that realm known as the contemporary art film, at that junction where lives of quiet desperation meet the cinema of sobriety. By this I don’t mean that anyone is a teetotaler in “Teddy Bear,” though Dennis’s breakfast slurry of nuked nutritional powder and egg whites is punishingly spartan. It’s only to say that the movie’s no-frills realism derives from common aesthetic strategies like hand-held cinematography and nonprofessional acting.Directed by Mads Matthiesen from a schematic screenplay by him and Martin Pieter Zandvliet, “Teddy Bear” is a largely likable tale about a 38-year-old man-child trying finally to grow up. When the movie opens, Dennis is having a nightmarish presumptive first date with a bored chick who listlessly picks at him and her food. Dennis explains that he’s a professional bodybuilder, but that he has to work in security to pay the bills. From the way he hides out for a spell in the men’s room, his heavy head listing toward the sink as if he were about to retch, it seems obvious that this isn’t his first lousy match. He brings to mind an Easter Island statue teetering and nearly toppling.There’s more to Dennis than initially appears, and, through a series of small narrative turns, he manages to shake off the Danish dreariness — he pries away from Mom’s viselike clutches with a lie about a bodybuilding competition in Germany — for the welcoming sun and embracing nights of Thailand. He makes the trip on the recommendation of another relative, his Uncle Bent (Allan Mogensen), who has suggested, with rather hilarious understatement, that it’s easier to meet women in Thailand. Guided by hope and a handful of glossy brochures, Dennis arrives in Pattaya on the east coast of Thailand, where he soon makes his way to a bar. There he is greeted by the proprietor, Scott (David Winters), who quickly asks Dennis what he likes in women, breast size included.Maybe that’s offensive, but Scott enters the movie shirtless and could easily wear a B cup himself, so it’s also funny. Although there are times when this world of tight smiles, monstrous maternity and hovering camerawork can feel too familiar, Mr. Matthiesen has a way of consistently and gently upending expectations, sometimes with humor. He also navigates the Pattaya bar scene with an equally welcome absence of defensiveness or condemnation. After scanning the mismatched pairs of older Western men and young Thai women, Dennis decides that the scene isn’t for him, a choice that leads him toward a friendly civilian, Toi (Lamaiporn Sangmanee Hougaard), who owns a local bodybuilding gym where Dennis finds camaraderie, and the movie enters a nice and easy sweet groove.",0,,,1

It tells of a Portuguese Jesuit priest, Father Rodrigues, who in 1643 heads into the dark heart of Japan, where Christians are being persecuted — boiled alive, immolated and crucified. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan, a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God. The film’s solemnity is seductive — as is Mr. Scorsese’s art — especially in light of the triviality and primitiveness of many movies, even if its moments of greatness also make its failures seem more pronounced.Mr. Scorsese’s work has long involved struggles of faith of one kind or another, from the religious guilt that afflicts Harvey Keitel’s thug in “Mean Streets” (“You don’t make up for your sins in the church.”) through that circle of hell known as “The Wolf of Wall Street.” In “Silence” the struggle begins in a mist-wreathed landscape where severed human heads rest on a crude shelf, like trophies of some ghastly victory. Today, decapitations in the name of religion are a gruesome hallmark of Islamist extremists, but here they introduce a dispute involving the Japanese authorities, who, intent on maintaining the country’s power and isolation, are set on eradicating Christianity, its proselytizers and converts.Figures soon emerge from the mist, notably Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who, as gaunt and tormented as any martyred Caravaggio saint, watches in gaping horror as guards ladle water from hot springs on shrieking Christians. Rodrigues learns about this hellish scene from Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds), who also relates that Ferreira has renounced his religion and is living as “a Japanese.” Rodrigues, having studied with Ferreira, refuses to accept that the older priest’s belief has been shattered and departs for Japan accompanied by another priest, Father Garupe (a fine, underused Adam Driver), and a Japanese guide, Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka, excellent).The movie’s early scenes are filled with severe pictorial beauty as the pale thermal steam snaking around the martyred Christians gives way to the vaulted white room where the black-clothed Jesuits meet. The chromatic contrast between the inkiness of their cassocks and the room’s ascetic whiteness finds an echo in Rodrigues’s rigid dualism, a belief in absolutes that will be tested. His resoluteness even seems answered by the calm camerawork (no jitters here), which early on is dramatically punctuated by a ravishing overhead shot of the three Jesuit priests gliding down a flight of stony, bleach-white stairs, as if they were being looked down on from high above.Whether this represents God’s vision or that of the priests, it is very much the point of view of the movie’s own creator. This overhead shot and others suggest that there’s a divine aspect to the priests’ mission, an idea that Mr. Scorsese visually and narratively underlines in the Lazarus-like cave in which Rodrigues and Garupe first take shelter in Japan; in Rodrigues’s self-aggrandizing identification with Jesus; and, crucially, through the figure of Judas. As in Mr. Scorsese’s 1988 film, “The Last Temptation of Christ,” his messy, excitingly alive adaptation of that Nikos Kazantzakis novel, Judas must play a part in “Silence” because without him there can be no Jesus.Once in Japan, Rodrigues and Garupe make contact with a village of hidden Christians, who live in fear of the authorities and a cobralike smiler known as the Inquisitor, Inoue (Issey Ogata, in one of the film’s strongest performances). By day, the priests hide in a small, cramped hut near the village; by night, they lead their new flock in dimly lighted rooms, delivering sermons in Latin, baptizing children and taking confession. Mr. Scorsese draws some modest, uneasy comedy from the linguistic and cultural differences between the priests and their congregation, as when a grabby, highly agitated woman begs the rather startled Garupe to hear her confession.Despite the mugging from both confessor and confessed, the exchange feels forced and comes across as a bid to lighten the gloom; if anything, it turns a feverish plea for absolution into a bit of vaudeville. There’s something uncomfortably and literally childlike about this child of God, who, like the other villagers, with their pleading eyes and hands, seems like a relic from a white-savior myth. Kichijiro, who enters grunting and twitching, as if in homage to Toshiro Mifune, and grovels at the priest’s feet, also seems on hand as much for comic relief as for guidance. Yet, even as the film seems to share the outsider perspectives of Rodrigues and Garupe, instructively, it is the village elders — brilliantly played by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto — who give these scenes flesh, bone and pain.“Silence” is based on the 1966 novel by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo that has attracted heavyweight admirers since it was first published. Graham Greene praised the novel, as did John Updike; for years, Mr. Scorsese tried to turn it into a film. (He wrote the foreword for a recent edition.) Filled with reams of religious dialogue, the novel fictionalizes history — the 17th-century purging of Christianity in Japan — as a means to explore religious faith and cultural difference. What preoccupies Endo is whether Western Christianity can take root in what the Inquisitor describes as “this swamp of Japan,” which seems inhospitable to outside forces. It’s a story of God, nation and myth.It’s easy to understand Mr. Scorsese’s interest in the novel and specifically in the character of Rodrigues. Despite the priest’s piety, black vestments and narrative prominence, he is no more a Hollywood hero than most of Mr. Scorsese’s falling and fallen men, with their arrogance and vanity. Rodrigues cowers in fear, recoils from his flock and assures himself of the goodness that the church — and he, by extension — has brought. (He pities the worshipers but is proud of his ministering.) His faith, including in himself, sustains Rodrigues, but even as he tends to the souls of the hidden Christians he fails to ease their earthly suffering. God is silent; in a way, so is this most ardent missionary.The silence of the title resounds insistently; it’s in the screams of the faithful and in Rodrigues’s endless searching. Why, he agonizes with no self-awareness, does God not answer prayers and alleviate suffering, a question which proves too heavy a load for Mr. Garfield’s talents. When he plays against the other actors, he can seem as decorative as a plaster saint (his luxuriously styled hair is right out of a 1950s biblical epic), which makes the other performers and their characters look stronger, and works for the story. Rodrigues is weak. But it’s weakness without depth or the burning belief that would make his errors shattering. When he carries on alone, speaking to God, questioning and suffering at great, monotonous length, his weakness becomes tedious, as does the film.“Silence” argues against orthodoxy, but its messenger is too pallid. This is less the fault of Mr. Garfield than of Mr. Scorsese’s conception of Rodrigues as the story’s fulcrum instead of its void. Mr. Scorsese fills the film with haunting tableaus and performances — including from Tadanobu Asano, as the Interpreter — that tug from the edges, pulling attention away from its center. In the end, nothing that Rodrigues says resonates as deeply as Inoue’s terrifying, teasing whine, which conveys the larger cultural and political stakes; nothing imparts the mystery of creation as potently as the flicker of a darting emerald lizard or an eerie parade of cats prowling through a spookily deserted village.These moments shake “Silence” and you too; the movie could use more jolts, more trembling, more surrealism; maybe, as in “The Last Temptation of Christ,” a talking lion to go along with its trippy lizard. “Silence” is as visually striking as you might expect, but also overly tidy, clean and decorous, despite its tortured flesh, its mud and its blood. There’s a crushing lack of urgency to this story and its telling, perhaps because it took Mr. Scorsese, who wrote the script with Jay Cocks, so long to make “Silence.” It’s disappointing because few directors can engage doubt and belief as powerfully as Mr. Scorsese can, but also because doubt and belief have again set the world on fire.",0,7063885.0,7100177.0,1

All it takes to liberate the beast is a beautiful, seductive woman whose wiles can turn a mouse into a man. So goes the hoary, misogynist pop myth that drives “Better Living Through Chemistry,” a tepid but pleasant comic satire given a shot of contemporaneity by its writing and directing team, Geoff Moore and David Posamentier, and its star Sam Rockwell.Nowadays, the movie implies, it takes more than a siren’s pheromones to enable a nice guy to develop a spine and morph into a sexy bad boy. This is the 21st century, after all. A little (actually a lot) of chemical assistance should be able to jump-start the transformation. All the better if that sleeping tiger is a druggist with ready access to pharmaceutical goodies.When first encountered, Mr. Rockwell’s agreeably meek character, Doug Varney, suggests Walter Mitty without an imagination. In the language of 1950s sitcoms, he might be described as a “henpecked husband.” Doug is about to take over the pharmacy run by his bullying father-in-law, Walter (Ken Howard), who treats him with infinite disdain.Doug’s wife, Kara (Michelle Monaghan), is a voracious go-getter who runs a spinning class and organizes the local Tour de Woodbury, a bike race named for the generic small town where they live. She always comes in first. The couple have a pudgy 12-year-old son, Ethan (Harrison Holzer), who is obsessed with ninja warfare and expresses his rebellion by depositing samples of his poop around school. The faculty is not amused, and the Varneys are summoned to a parent-teacher conference.Doug’s humdrum life takes a turn when he makes a pharmaceutical home delivery to Elizabeth (Olivia Wilde), a rich, unhappily married quasi-femme-fatale. In no time, she has persuaded him to unleash his inner wild man, and soon they are washing down pills with booze and bouncing off the walls.When Elizabeth confesses that she is bored to death with her husband (Ray Liotta), the movie threatens to become a parody of “The Postman Always Rings Twice.” But “Better Living Through Chemistry” never becomes a full-fledged film noir. It reads as an unabashedly positive infomercial for gorging on the apparently risk-free, liberating products of Big Pharma. Mr. Rockwell, always an adept comic, plays Doug’s metamorphosis lightly, and Ms. Wilde, for all her charms, refrains from portraying Elizabeth as a poisonous temptress. Their heat-free sex scenes are pure farce.“Better Living Through Chemistry” has its mildly subversive moments, especially when Doug bonds with his son by inviting him on a vandalizing spree. Most of the surprises are plot tricks in which he narrowly (and improbably) escapes disaster. For some reason, the story is intermittently narrated by Jane Fonda, whose character is identified as herself. Why is she there? Who knows? Her presence distracts more than it helps.",0,51772.0,,0

Beloved of crime lords and doofuses alike, Keanu the kitten shows up early, padding underfoot through one of those artfully staged drug labs — armed guards, white powder, ominous lighting — that’s soon lit up with the sights and sounds of heavy artillery. Much like the Buddhalicious star he’s named for, Keanu slips unscathed through the fast-and-furious raining bullets, miraculously dodging death as a heavenly chorus lays down an apocalyptic track. Kitten has skills.That’s the high-concept goof in “Keanu,” a 10-minute sketch that’s been inflated to bloated feature length. Running 90 minutes too long, the movie is a slack, erratically amusing excuse to watch Mr. Key and Mr. Peele tag-team after ending “Key & Peele,” their celebrated, often blazingly funny Comedy Central series that turned them into national memes. The road to Mr. Key and Mr. Peele’s future as movie headliners, though, will take more than kittens, guns and a riff on gangbangers head-bobbing to George Michael. What’s needed is a sharper, smarter edge, like the one they used on their show to lacerate pop-cultural and political targets; also, more and better jokes.The good news is that Mr. Key and Mr. Peele comfortably hold the big screen, whether they’re playing ordinary guys or imitating killers. The movie, which Mr. Peele wrote with the longtime “Key & Peele” contributor Alex Rubens, opens with the kitten running from the drug-lab shootout and landing at the door of Rell (Mr. Peele), who’s distraught after being dumped by his girlfriend. Like every man in the movie, Rell falls for the cat and — after rising from a miasma of pot smoke while flanked by posters for “New Jack City” and Michael Mann’s “Heat” — names his fluffy new friend Keanu. A new love is born, one that’s blessed by Rell’s cousin, Clarence (Mr. Key), if also nearly doomed.Things start cooking when Keanu disappears, forcing Rell and Clarence to play detective while chasing leads and kitten tail. They end up in a strip club, where women provide the topless decoration on and off the pole in a joint, bada bing, run by a gangster, Cheddar (Method Man), and his gunslingers. (The flat-liner here is that the crew calls itself the 17th Street Blips, à la the Crips and the Bloods.) There, Rell and Clarence, latter-day Hardy Boys, pretend to be hard-core criminals, a quickie makeover that largely involves putting a swagger in their step, talking street (or like black extras in an exploitation flick) and punctuating their cartoonish braggadocio with R-rated filler.On their show, Mr. Key and Mr. Peele turned code switching into an aesthetic principle, most famously in their sketches involving President Obama (brilliantly channeled by Mr. Peele) and his Anger Translator, Luther (Mr. Key). In “Keanu,” once Rell and Clarence start hanging with Cheddar’s group, they swap their everyday speech (“good English”) for tougher, rougher talk and haphazard grammar. They drop their final “g’s,” sprinkle on the “ain’ts” and vamp like gangbangers. It’s a metamorphosis that sounds like conceptual gold, as Mr. Key and Mr. Peele — drawing from the comedy of masquerade and playing with racially coded speech and behavior — turn a pair of amusing milquetoasts who happen to be black into black stereotypes right out of central casting.Rell and Clarence are performing thuggery, at least at first, walking the bad-man walk and talking the talk while frantically looking for the exit. And despite the sluggish passages and hum of unease, it’s fun watching these performers play with clichés amid a guest visit from Anna Faris and the sight of Clarence’s minivan’s becoming a safe space for gangsta sharing and caring. (The director is Peter Atencio, another “Key & Peele” veteran.) But as the genre machinery chugs along, the bang-bang begins to overwhelm the movie, and the underlying critique gives way to a what-me-worry shrug. Keanu may be Rell and Clarence’s power animal. But he’s no match for Liam “Neesons,” the character whom Mr. Key and Mr. Peele named in honor of the Hollywood hepcat who explodes minds and bodies both.“Keanu” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

And that’s one of the many irritants in this trite, well-intentioned lecture on tolerance: The audience is always several moves ahead of the script.As Jenny, a social worker in Cleveland, Katherine Heigl seems barely able to control her impatience with a lesbian character whose charade of heterosexuality means constantly lying to her marriage-obsessed family. Her ridiculously narrow-minded parents (Tom Wilkinson and Linda Emond) are happier believing that she is seeing a married man than that she’s on the shelf. And her vinegary sister, Anne (Grace Gummer), can’t resist crowing.“I have everything she wants,” she says, smugly. “Two kids and a husband.” Anne’s desiccated lawn suggests otherwise, but excruciating metaphors are par for the course in a story (by the director, Mary Agnes Donoghue) that chokes authenticity with clichéd speeches and hectoring pop songs. Worse, as Jenny’s supposedly longtime lover, the usually winning Alexis Bledel must play a blank slate whose connection to Jenny is as invisible as her personality.But “Jenny’s Wedding” isn’t really about a lesbian romance; it’s about secrets and lies and entrenched bigotry. From supermarket to firehouse, Jenny’s marital status is the sole topic of conversations packed with antiquated attitudes and who’s-to-blame arguments. The result is a movie so hopelessly late to the coming-out party that you want to haul everyone connected with it into the 21st century.“Jenny’s Wedding” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"Review: In ‘Elle,’ Isabelle Huppert Subverts the Role of Rape Victim","The opening scene of “Elle” is a shocker: a brutal sexual assault witnessed by a house cat and filmed with pitiless detachment. “The opposite of a trigger warning,” as a friend of mine said. Everything that follows is, in some ways, even more shocking, as the movie — a masterpiece of suave perversity, directed by Paul Verhoeven — leads its audience through a meticulously constructed maze of ambiguity, scrambling our assumptions and expectations at every turn, dispensing discomfort and delight and daring us to distinguish one from the other.After it’s over, you may find yourself in an argument about just what kind of movie you saw. A nasty, exploitative spectacle of a woman’s victimization, or the celebration of her resistance? A feminist tale of rape and revenge, or an exercise in chic, cynical misogyny? It may be worth noting that both the director and the author of the source material are men. (“Elle” is based on the novel “Oh …,” by Philippe Djian, the author of “Betty Blue.”) These gender-political talking points commingle with basic questions of genre, since the film continually changes register from one moment to the next. It’s a psychological thriller, a strangely dry-eyed melodrama, a kinky sex farce and, perhaps most provocatively, a savage comedy of bourgeois manners.Mostly, though — inarguably, I would say — it is a platform for the astonishing, almost terrifying talent of Isabelle Huppert. Ms. Huppert, onscreen for virtually every second, gives “Elle” much of its fascination and most of its coherence. In the pages of David Birke’s script or Mr. Djian’s novel, her character, Michèle Leblanc, may or may not be a stable literary construct, but as embodied by Ms. Huppert, she possesses the sublime credibility of a classic film heroine. Ms. Huppert has the unrivaled ability to fuse contradictory traits and actions into a singular, complex and endlessly interesting personality. The movie’s title is succinct and comprehensive. It’s all about her.But, of course, Michèle is not alone. Her masked assailant will return, in flashback and fantasy and also in the flesh, but more of “Elle” is devoted to Michèle’s interactions with the other people in her life, who are reliable sources of vexation, inconvenience and distraction. She is a competent, confident woman surrounded by fools, with the sole (and partial) exception of Anna (Anne Consigny), her best friend and business partner.The two of them run a small, successful video-game company where a few of the male employees seem to have trouble working for a female boss. Michèle knows how to handle them, though. An awful lot of her time and attention is devoted to handling the insecurities and emotional needs of men, a fact that counts as one of the film’s principal feminist insights.There is her ex-husband, Richard (Charles Berling), a semi-successful novelist; their son, Vincent (Jonas Bloquet), a man-child with a dubious work ethic; and Robert (Christian Berkel), Anna’s husband, with whom Michèle has been having an affair. Casting a shadow over all of them is Michèle’s father, a truly monstrous patriarch guilty of a crime that is at once the movie’s Rosebud and its MacGuffin.There is also a handsome neighbor named Patrick (Laurent Lafitte), who appears to be an exception to the general rule of male inadequacy. (Appearances can be deceiving, though.) But men hardly hold a monopoly on awfulness. Michèle also has to deal with her mother (Judith Magre), a comic-opera narcissist who offends all of her daughter’s principles of etiquette and taste, and with Vincent’s selfish, abusive girlfriend (Alice Isaaz).Not that Michèle is a paragon of innocence, or even of decency. As her mother points out, she has a mean streak, and at times she seems to revel in her own cruelty. Her subtle smiles and eye rolls are signals to the audience, but also warnings. We are drawn to her side, but we may also, at some point, be subject to her judgment and her mockery.Or, perhaps, to Mr. Verhoeven’s. He is a bit of a sadist, in a grand tradition of movie control freaks that goes back to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Brian De Palma and Claude Chabrol. Michèle’s prurient, inscrutable cat is his alter ego, and we are the mice, batted from indignation to dread to uneasy amusement, according to his predatory whims.This may not be everyone’s idea of fun, but there is something exciting about watching “Elle” as a duet for director and star. In the American phase of his career, Mr. Verhoeven, who started out in the Netherlands, was a blockbuster sleight-of-hand artist, disguising pungent, politically tinged satires as noisy sci-fi action movies and overheated potboilers. Much of his work from the ’80s and ’90s — “RoboCop,” “Starship Troopers,” “Basic Instinct” and, yes, “Showgirls” — is still worth watching, and still misunderstood. These are Hollywood movies with “Hollywood” in italics and quotation marks, combining lurid overstatement with subtle, even subliminal irony.“Elle” works in much the same way, with “French” in place of “Hollywood.” France’s official selection for the foreign-language Oscar, it is both an impeccably Gallic delicacy and a gleeful parody of Frenchness, in particular the kind of decorous, exquisitely decorated Parisian lifestyle voyeurism that contributes so much to the national cinematic brand. The film’s episodes of violence erupt into a milieu defined by elegant dinners and vigorous verbal fencing matches, a world that keeps going in the aftermath of mayhem, its essential sang-froid undisturbed. Which may be the biggest shock of all, and also a perverse source of comfort. Michèle’s composure never falters, and neither does Ms. Huppert’s conviction. You can have your doubts about “Elle,” but you can’t help believing in her.“Elle” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex and sexual violence.

215,2012-02-08,The Miners' Hymns,,UK,Bill Morrison,Drama,English,76.0,52.0,"Jóhann Jóhannsson, Bill Morrison",2010,7.2,74.0,10.0,2017-11-02 04:18:14,MANOHLA DARGIS,An Industry Beneath the Surface,"The hard, weathered faces that stare out of the past in “The Miners’ Hymns” at times look as if they were carved from granite. They were, in truth, created in the coal pits of County Durham, in northeast England. From the middle of the 19th century until the 1990s, Durham was the site of hundreds of collieries with atmospheric names like Akleyheads Pit and Yew Tree Drift. These days the local tourist industry pushes the region’s natural beauty and charming towns (as of spring 2010, 67 percent of its work force was in the service sector), and the Durham tourism board can even suggest a half-day sightseeing jaunt that takes you from a castle to a former colliery village.There’s a similar museological quality to “The Miners’ Hymns,” an elegant, elegiac found-footage work from Bill Morrison, best known for his silent-film reverie “Decasia.” Unlike ersatz “found footage” flicks like “Paranormal Activity” that involve no found footage and often no film (invariably these distractions are shot and shown digitally), this is the real deal, having been constructed from original filmed images. (Alas, “The Miners’ Hymns” is being presented digitally.) A miner himself of a type, Mr. Morrison has dug into the archives of the likes of the British Film Institute to cull primarily black-and-white images so rich, so alive with dirty faces, shadows and the occasional pit pony that they resurrect a world that for many has long been lost to history.The movie opens with aerial color visuals of an unidentified coastline, the camera gliding over washed out swatches of green and row upon row of identical looking houses. Every so often Mr. Morrison punctuates this view with text indicating that this or that swatch was the site of a former colliery and gives the date of its closure. This proves a rare instance of overt authorial presence, beyond the inclusion of the moody, mood-painting score by the Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson. Unlike mainstream documentary filmmakers, Mr. Morrison doesn’t like to explain much — there are no guiding voices or additional text — even if it quickly becomes evident that he has a story to tell that stretches from the dawn of the 20th century to near its dark close.Initially, it appears to be a tale of work and of men wrenching treasure out of the earth’s depths, though there’s play here too, mostly in scenes from the annual celebration called the Miners’ Gala. (Women and children worked in coal mines aboveground, but they’re mostly sidelined here.) Soon, as Mr. Morrison gently skips around in time, a historical narrative emerges as the images shift from what looks like the early 1900s deeper into the century. Clips from the galas are mixed in with shots of men laboring, first with hand tools and then with machines that shave coal off the tunnel walls like ice, seemingly rendering human effort almost if never entirely superfluous. Some late images of massing police and busloads of what may be scabs gesture toward the story’s eventual end.At a fast-moving 52 minutes, “The Miners’ Hymns” makes for enthralling if also somewhat frustrating viewing. It’s understandable why Mr. Morrison wouldn’t want to clog up these beautiful images with banal information, say about death rates and strikes, but the absence of such directorial input gives the material an ahistorical quality that’s at odds with the difficult, sometimes brutal, violent and still-living history behind these images. It would make quite the double bill with “The Iron Lady,” the recent historically fanciful trifle about Margaret Thatcher, who helped crush the miners’ union in the 1980s. “The Miners’ Hymns” is the better, far more satisfying work and, in its Film Forum engagement, it comes with some dividends: three of Mr. Morrison’s earlier shorts, all of which also consist of skillfully, clearly lovingly manipulated older material that originated on film.",0,,,0

Over the years this sturdy if supple genre has survived extraordinary cultural and social changes, most notably the suffragist movement in the early part of the last century and women’s rights toward the latter. Liberated women, along with the pill, quickie divorces, swinging couples, blended families and various wars both abroad and at home might have dinged the genre, but it has endured and adapted, even when the story now hinges on boy meets boy meets boy (as in “Shortbus”)  or pops up on the small screen (“Sex and the City”).When it comes to the old straight-boy-meets-straight-girl configuration with big-studio production values, however, you might as well forget it, at least if you’re a woman. Outside of Judd Apatow, who has carved out a niche and inspired something of a subgenre with movies about funny, smutty but sincere man-boys puzzling their way through adult heterosexual relations, the romantic comedy is nearly as dead as Meg Ryan’s career. In the best of these films, the women aren’t romantic foils, much less equals: they’re either (nice) sluts or (nicer) wives, and essentially as mysterious and unknowable as the dark side of the moon. In the most calculating (“The Hangover”), they are strippers with hearts and racks of gold or emasculating shrews.Which leads to “The Ugly Truth,” a cynical, clumsy, aptly titled attempt to cross the female-oriented romantic comedy with the male-oriented gross-out comedy that is interesting on several levels, none having to do with cinema. Katherine Heigl plays Abby, a producer for a ratings-challenged Sacramento morning television show, the kind that specializes in empty smiles, cooking tips and weather updates. She’s single and therefore, in the moral economy of modern Hollywood, unhappy. Her life goes into a tailspin when her boss hires a professional ape, Mike (Gerard Butler), who delivers loutish maxims on camera about the sexes that basically all boil down to this: Men have penises,  and women should accommodate them any which way they can, preferably in push-up bras and remote-controlled vibrating panties.The two leads, bathed in an otherworldly golden light that makes their skin look honey-roasted and turns their teeth into beacons, look tasty indeed, almost finger-lickin’ good. Ms. Heigl doesn’t do perky all that persuasively, but she does keep her smile and relative dignity even in scenes in which Abby is forced to play the fool, which is often, as when she’s hanging upside down from a tree in her skivvies. She even survives the scene that finds Abby writhing spasmodically during a dinner with her corporate masters, because, well, she’s wearing those pulsating panties, the boy at the next table has the remote, and there’s nothing funnier (or, really, scarier) than the spectacle of female pleasure. Well, it worked in “When Harry Met Sally.”The director, Robert Luketic,  who did far better with “Legally Blonde,” appears to have instructed his actors to (over)play their roles for the hard of seeing and hard of hearing, resulting in across-the-board loud line readings, mugging faces and flopping (clothed) body parts. Mr. Butler, an appealing screen presence who needs better roles or savvier career counseling, does his grinning best with a charmless, unbelievable character who of course is hiding a wounded heart under his leathery man hide. (The first tip-off: Mike provides babe advice to his young nephew, an ape in training.) The fantasy of the redeemable, even lovable cad is a favorite romantic fantasy, one that the writers Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith peddle shamelessly.That three women thought up this junk should be no more surprising than the fact that the movie is being released by Columbia Pictures, which is overseen by Amy Pascal, the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. One of the lessons of “The Ugly Truth” — beyond the obvious one that a desirable, desiring woman can never, ever, be happily single and sexual in modern Hollywood — is that holding to your hard-won ideals is of no consequence, at least when there’s a guy to be hooked. When Mike is brought in, Abby fights him because she sees him for what he is: the lowest common denominator. Eventually, though, she succumbs to his coarse ways, even adopting his crude language, because, well, that’s what the public wants.Isn’t that right, Ms. Pascal?“The Ugly Truth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

217,2015-07-17,Trainwreck,"Colin Quinn, Devin Fabry, Carla Oudin, Amy Schumer",USA,Judd Apatow,"Comedy, Drama, Romance","English, Mandarin",75.0,125.0,Amy Schumer,2015,6.2,117943.0,85.0,2017-11-02 04:18:21,MANOHLA DARGIS,Review: &#8216;Trainwreck&#8217; Delivers the Full Amy Schumer Experience,"Amy Schumer is my kind of superhero — she stops haters dead. As fans of her Comedy Central show, “Inside Amy Schumer,” know, there’s almost nothing that anyone can say about women, her included, that she hasn’t already said herself. Her powers of deflection are the perfect approach in a neofeminist moment in which women are calling out sexists, sometimes against vicious pushback. Think that she’s not thin enough or pretty enough? She intercepts hateful slurs like those and turns them into ferocious comedy gold that exposes chauvinism as the absurdity it is. She can’t be stereotyped away as a sourpuss who just needs to chill out, lie back and smile. She’s already smiling, and she’s killing it, joke after joke.In “Trainwreck,” Ms. Schumer plays, well, Amy, a more vanilla version of one of her comically flawed women, who aren’t as remotely together as they think or may appear to be. The movie, which was directed by Judd Apatow from her script, is often extremely funny, even if it never approaches the radicalness of her greatest, most dangerous work. Mr. Apatow’s talent as a movie director is opening up a space on screen in which comic performers (and some total stiffs) can be effortlessly funny together. In “Trainwreck,” he creates a roomy, comfortable vehicle stuffed with second bananas (both professional zanies and guest-starring squares), who support Ms. Schumer as she tosses out jokes, pops her eyes, deploys her deadpan and shows off her gift for old-school physical high jinks, often in heels and minis.Ms. Schumer drew on her own life for the story, which she turned into something of a sexual bildungsroman cum romantic comedy jumping with pop-cultural references and edged with razored social cultural critique. Her on-screen doppelgänger works as a writer for a men’s magazine, S’Nuff, a blistering, jokey title that sums up the idiocy of lad mags and their annihilating views on women. That the editor running it is a woman, Dianna (a peerless Tilda Swinton, in a swingy shag and gloomy spray tan), isn’t surprising. Ms. Schumer can be a merciless equal-opportunity takedown artist. If she doesn’t let women off the hook, it’s because she knows that sexism isn’t exclusively a guy thing; like stupidity, it is a people thing.“Trainwreck” is pretty straight stuff: Amy likes to have sex with men and isn’t interested in monogamy. That makes her like a lot of women (studies show!), if not like those who generally flounder through the average dippy romantic comedy, where gender norms are rigorously enforced and the only things contemporary about the characters are their designer threads and gadgets. What’s energizing and exciting about Amy, especially when compared with the sexless cuties populating rom-coms, in which female pleasure is often expressed through shopping, is that her erotic appetites aren’t problems that she needs to narratively solve and vanquish. She likes sex, thanks, as an early montage of her shuffling through various men nicely illustrates.Amy does have issues, which give the movie a fuzzy focal point, namely that she needs to believe she’s worthy of a man’s love or something. The movie suggests that this has to do with her adored father, Gordon (Colin Quinn), who’s introduced in the opener delivering uncommon words of advice to the 9-year-old Amy and her younger sister, Kim. “Monogamy isn’t realistic,” Gordon declares, instructing his daughters to repeat after him. Fast forward 23 years, and Amy has done just that, seemingly taking those words to heart by freely taking men to bed. She’s breezily accepting of her choices, though falters when she receives a one-two punch: She falls for a monogamous-minded surgeon, Aaron (Bill Hader, sweetly vulnerable), and her father’s bad health dramatically worsens.Ms. Schumer doesn’t worry too hard about what Amy wants and why, preferring to go with the story flow and use the passage from swinging singleton to cuddling coupledom to cover the joke spectrum, from the comedy of erections to the trouble with spooning. The postcoital nuzzling bit echoes some laughs that the standup comic Elayne Boosler generated about men, women and intimacy (“I think you should make love and go to your corners”) in her landmark, self-financed 1985 comedy special, “Party of One.” A pioneering figure in the 1970s New York standup scene, Ms. Boosler is one of those female pop-cultural warriors (like Clara Bow, Mae West, Beyoncé, etc.) who insist on claiming their sexuality as, you know, their own.The movie’s giddy first half zips along more smoothly than the second, which sputters when the story takes a short, awkwardly managed detour into tragedy. Ms. Schumer trained as an actress, and her tears in “Trainwreck” are fairly persuasive, if not as contagious as her laughs. Yet while they’re narrative necessities, they’re also tonally at odds with the movie’s overall buoyancy. (Mr. Apatow’s sentimental side is crystallized by a close-up of a weeping Amy, a shot that underscores the obvious.) As with a lot of debuts, there are a few different stories crammed into “Trainwreck,” which is Ms. Schumer’s first produced film script, and the least satisfying one is the melodrama about the daughter struggling to come to terms with her feelings for an aggressively unlovable father who begot, bred and loved her.Ms. Schumer fares better when she’s slaying symbolic fathers, as in a brutally funny short scene, tucked in a montage sequence, in which Amy and Aaron have sex on a bench in front of a bridge. Much like the flourish from George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” that slips onto the “Trainwreck” soundtrack, this image initially sneaks in like yet another homage to Woody Allen’s 1979 film, “Manhattan,” and the most famous image in his work. The allusion quickly turns into an evisceration of that movie’s gauzy romanticism when Amy jokes that she thinks this is where “Woody Allen met Soon-Yi.” It sounds cheap only if you forget that the other romantic couple in “Manhattan,” the one not immortalized on the bridge, was played by Mr. Allen and a teenage Mariel Hemingway.It’s gratifying to see Mr. Apatow, who in recent years has worked with the likes of Kristen Wiig and Lena Dunham, continue to put his show-business power to good by joining forces with a smart woman. For too long, the bromances (a subgenre that he popularized) and its corollary, the wedding comedy, have segregated heterosexual men and women into seemingly irreconcilable camps. After “Bridesmaids” blew up, my colleague A. O. Scott astutely suggested that perhaps what it revealed wasn’t that women can be funny but that, as he wrote, “men and women can’t be funny at the same time, or direct their humor at one another.” Similarly to Ms. Dunham, who in her show “Girls” brilliantly grapples with what heterosexual romance means today, Ms. Schumer may be helping change that dynamic.As with any young talent, she has a way to go, including as a screenwriter. “Trainwreck” has groaners and dead spots (including a dreary art-film parody with Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei), and its jokes about race don’t have the penetrating wit that her material on sex and gender does. Like a lot of white people, Ms. Schumer can fumble when latching onto race; unlike a lot of white performers, she takes on race directly. The looming appearance of LeBron James, who plays himself as well as Aaron’s odd-couple-like best friend, may be a heat-seeking gimmick (he’s the movie’s biggest star), but he’s a surprisingly limber comic presence and he helps set up a sharp scene in which Aaron challenges Amy’s bumblingly false claim about having black friends.Amy wiggles through that embarrassment, as she does repeatedly. That could be seen as having your cake and eating it too, but mostly it adds another ding to an often ridiculous, imperfect, recognizable character. (This is, after all, a woman who, when she cuts back on her drinking, donates her booze to a derelict played by Dave Attell.) At times in some of her bits, Ms. Schumer has, like other comics, used fakey apologies as get-out-of- jail cards, as a way to both toss out insults and smilingly refuse responsibility for them. In “Trainwreck,” as in her best work elsewhere, Ms. Schumer is at her strongest when she insists that women aren’t distressed damsels but — as they toddle, walk and race in the highest of heels, the tightest of skirts, the sexiest, mightiest of poses — the absolute agents of their lives and desires.“Trainwreck” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

218,2012-03-02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,A. O. SCOTT,How the Grinch Stole the Lorax,"Since its publication in 1971 “The Lorax,” by Dr. Seuss, has occasionally been caught up in squalls of controversy, most of it cooked up by people choosing to be outraged by the book’s mild allegorical moral of ecological responsibility. In our own globally warmed, ideologically fevered moment there has been a minor flurry of predictable, pre-emptive bloviation aimed at Universal’s movie version, “Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax,” which is supposedly part of a left-wing Hollywood conspiracy to brainwash America’s children into hating capitalism and loving trees.Having donned recyclable 3-D glasses and seen the thing for myself, I’m not sure whether to mock the enemies of “The Lorax” for their cluelessness, to offer them reassurance or to compliment them for being half-right. Thematically the movie, directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda from a script by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul and made under the auspices of the Illumination animation studio, dutifully lectures its audience on the folly of overconsumption and the virtue of conservation. At times the imagery takes on a dark, almost apocalyptic cast as it surveys the smogged-up, denuded landscape where the trees used to be and the shiny, commercialized pseudo-utopia (called Thneedville) that an alienated humanity, having lost the memory of nature, now calls home.Don’t be fooled. Despite its soft environmentalist message “The Lorax” is an example of what it pretends to oppose. Its relationship to Dr. Seuss’s book is precisely that of the synthetic trees that line the streets of Thneedville to the organic Truffulas they have displaced. The movie is a noisy, useless piece of junk, reverse-engineered into something resembling popular art in accordance with the reigning imperatives of marketing and brand extension.This is not a matter of hypocrisy or corporate green-washing on the part of the filmmakers, nor of reflexive Loraxian dogmatism on my part. The corporate entertainment system has shown itself perfectly capable of injecting soul into what it sells, and at inflecting some of its products with a critical spirit. “Wall-E” is a transcendent example, brilliantly embracing its own contradictions, but there are plenty of other movies, animated and not, that manage to pay tribute to the beauty of the natural world even as they revel in giddy, merchandising-friendly artifice.And Theodor Seuss Geisel, it should be noted, was hardly averse to commerce. He started out in advertising and built his middle name into a formidable brand that, like the Once-ler’s empire in “The Lorax,” grew bigger and bigger and bigger. But in his lifetime Geisel exercised strict quality control, a practice that his estate has abandoned, authorizing a series of cinematic abominations both live-action (“Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” “Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat”) and animated (“Dr. Seuss’s Horton Hears a Who!” and now this one).“The Lorax,” while it nods in the direction of Dr. Seuss’s distinctive, trippy drawing style, treats his sensibility as, at best, a decorative element. The movie’s silliness, like its preachiness, is loud and slightly hysterical, as if young viewers could be entertained only by a ceaseless barrage of sensory stimulus and pop-culture attitude, or instructed by songs that make the collected works of Up With People sound like Metallica. The simple fable of the Lorax and the Once-ler is wrapped in gaudy, familiar business and festooned with grim, forced cheer. What do the kids want? Car chases! Kooky grandmas! Pint-size villains flanked by thuggish minions! Things that fly! Taylor Swift!“The Lorax” has all that and more. (The grandma is voiced by the meme of the moment Betty White; a villain added for the movie is voiced by Rob Riggle.) It tells parallel stories, one about a young boy named Ted (Zac Efron), who in order to impress a girl (Ms. Swift) sets out to find an actual, living tree. (Of course the girl couldn’t possibly go out and find the tree herself, a sexist assumption that is, unfortunately, the only authentically Seussian aspect of the movie.) He ventures over the metal wall that encloses Thneedville and finds the Once-ler (Ed Helms), a hermit who tells the tale of his own encounter with the cranky orange Lorax (Danny DeVito).“I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.” Those words are a permanent part of the literary heritage, and no movie can change that. And when the Lorax is around, warily befriending the ambitious Once-ler, you can almost believe you are in the Seussian universe. The parable of an ambitious entrepreneur who lets his ingenuity curdle into unchecked greed is more or less intact, and his corruption is conveyed in a few memorable, semi-inspired visual flights. But these only emphasize the hectic, willful mediocrity that characterizes the rest of the movie, and far too many of its kind.In the film as in the book, the Once-ler ravages the landscape and destroys the Truffula trees to manufacture thneeds, knitted garments that have multiple uses but no real utility. Demand for them is insatiable for a while, and then, once the trees are gone, the thneeds are forgotten, partly because nobody really needed them in the first place. There is an obvious metaphor here, but the movie is blind to it, and to everything else that is interesting or true in the story it tries to tell.“The Lorax” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Scary scenes, a bit of naughtiness, nonstop hucksterism.",0,,,0

It is more like a zanier downscale version of the Upper West Side of “Seinfeld,” itself an anachronism, given the area’s real estate boom.Here, Morris Bliss (Michael C. Hall), a 35-year-old deadbeat, lives with his widowed father, Seymour (Peter Fonda), who gives him an allowance that he fritters away doing nothing in particular. On one wall of his bedroom hangs a map of the world studded with pushpins, each attached to a place he would like to visit but probably never will.Although Morris dresses shabbily and exudes the petulance of an overgrown child, he is a babe magnet. Who knows why?The opening scene finds him frantically shooing away Stephanie Jouseski (Brie Larson), a mouthy 18-year-old cutie he has just bedded. Stephanie, who picked him up in a store, is a pesky irritant who keeps him continuously off balance with her demands. Their relationship becomes even more hazardous when Morris learns she is the daughter of Steven Jouseski (Brad William Henke), a k a Jetski, his best friend from high school. Knowing that Steven would go ballistic if he discovered the relationship, Morris tries in vain to extricate himself from Stephanie, who exhibits stalkerlike tendencies.Further evidence of Morris’s irresistibility to women is the predatory behavior of Andrea (Lucy Liu), an unhappily married neighbor in his building who hungrily pounces on him.At various points, “The Trouble With Bliss,” directed by Michael Knowles from Douglas Light’s novel “East Fifth Bliss,” evokes forerunners as dissimilar as “Moonstruck” and “After Hours” in its eccentric mix of the everyday and the surreal. Although it has some cute repartee, this movie more often than not confuses eccentricity with originality. Sentimental to the core, it treats its characters as the world’s most adorable kooks, which they are not.Morris may be a loser, but he neither languishes in self-pity nor lashes out at his father or the world in general. Seymour is remarkably tolerant of his son’s habit of squandering money he gives him for groceries that he forgets to buy. It is an unrewarding role for Mr. Fonda, who spends much of his screen time glumly lounging around the apartment in his bathrobe. Seymour still seems to be grieving the loss of his wife, who died when Morris was 14. But when the movie finally addresses the subject, it is too little, too late.Other characters include Morris’s buddy N J (Chris Messina), a dapper fantasist whose tales of world adventures culminate with his announcement that he is moving to Montana with Hattie (Sarah Shahi), a new sweetheart whose father owns the building where Morris and Seymour live. Hattie’s father also runs an American division of an international criminal cartel in which N J says he has taken a high-paying job.Morris has already encountered Hattie with two friends, armed with paint guns, squatting in an unfinished building whose construction crew is supervised by Steven. The ultimate link in this zany chain of connection is forged when Morris, by chance, runs into Steven, whom he hasn’t seen in years, and is welcomed as a long-lost pal. You idly wonder what will happen when Steven learns about Morris’s relationship with Stephanie.Nobody in this sweet-natured, low-testosterone trifle is out for blood. Mr. Hall gives an agreeable portrayal of a man-child not unlike David Fisher, his character on “Six Feet Under.” His performance doesn’t prevent “The Trouble With Bliss” from being the kind of movie that gives a bad name to the concept of “quirky.”",0,,,0

So is the job of carrying this entirely preposterous, not entirely unenjoyable movie.Though Damian has been assured that his new body was synthesized in a lab, it turns out to have been the property of a guy named Mark, who left behind a wife (Natalie Martinez) and daughter (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen) and who had the kind of superelite military training that tends to come in handy in films like this one. When various mid- and low-level bad guys start showing up in black S.U.V.s, it’s good to have the split-second reflexes and muscular strength necessary to snap their necks and break bathroom fixtures over their heads. ImageBen Kingsley as a dying real estate mogul who pays to have his consciousness transferred into the body of a younger man.CreditAlan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures, via Focus Features“Self/less,” written by the brothers David Pastor and Alex Pastor and directed by Tarsem Singh (“Mirror Mirror,” “The Cell”), has a smooth, opulent look and a plot that consists less of twists than of carefully signaled and executed turns. The first swerve is from one kind of rich-guy bad taste to another, as Damian swaps his old-guy Manhattan apartment — full of marble and baroque ornament and so heavily gilded that even the cocktail shaker is gold — for a sleek New Orleans bachelor mansion. He leaves behind his silver-haired business partner, Martin (Victor Garber), for a wingman named Anton (Derek Luke). Damian gives his hunky new body a workout on the basketball court and in bed, until his mind starts playing tricks on him. At that point the movie speeds up and shifts into more-or-less standard thriller mode, with fights and car chases, double-crosses and revelations of conspiracy. All of it unfolds in the atmosphere of gaudy, portentous vacuity that is Mr. Singh’s trademark.It turns out that Albright’s company is less exclusive than Damian had supposed, and that its methods of dealing with customer dissatisfaction are a bit extreme. A surprisingly large number of formerly dead people are running around popping red pills and thinking the thoughts of other dead people. Anyone who complains is likely to be killed all over again. The logical and logistical problems with this business plan should be obvious, but “Self/less” nonetheless spends a lot of time making poor Ms. Martinez act out the various emotional stages of discovering that her dead husband’s physical being is in effect a shell being used by a wealthy hermit crab.As for Damian, who like Mark has a daughter (a gloomy do-gooder played by Michelle Dockery of “Downton Abbey”), he belatedly discovers a conscience and a soul. “Self/less” has neither, despite an occasional stab at science-fiction self-seriousness. That isn’t to say it’s all bad. Mr. Reynolds is an appealing actor, and it’s easy enough to compensate for his limitations if you let yourself believe that he’s really Ben Kingsley the whole time.“Self/Less” is a rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

In the opening moments, Elizabeth Sloane, a formidable Washington lobbyist, legendary for her deviousness and determination to win at all costs, impassively describes her professional modus operandi. “Lobbying,” she declares, gazing straight into a camera, is about “foresight.” It involves anticipating an opponent’s next move and calculating your response ahead of time so that nothing takes you by surprise.With her heavily applied crimson lipstick, copper hair and pallid complexion, Elizabeth is beautiful but scary. She’s just one step away from a bloodless cousin of Morticia Addams. The story then jumps two years back, and Elizabeth is shown testifying before a Senate subcommittee. Questioned about breaking ethical rules by arranging a trip for a senator to Indonesia to research the feasibility of a tariff on palm oil, she repeatedly invokes the Fifth Amendment.The tone of the interrogation is so nasty that the film, directed by John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love”) from a screenplay by Jonathan Perera, appears to view the matter at hand as the earthshaking equivalent of passing nuclear secrets. At the end of the scene, Elizabeth loses her cool, speaks out, and immediately faces contempt charges that could land her a five-year prison sentence.The palm-oil brouhaha illustrates the savage, self-righteous tone of political warfare in a movie without an iota of humor. In Mr. Perera’s long-winded screenplay, the characters tend to give little speeches instead of conversing normally. Some of the wordplay may be clever, but the attempts at witty repartee aren’t sharp enough to be remotely amusing.We learn early in the film that Elizabeth lives on little sleep and relies on a roller coaster regimen of uppers and downers. Outside of work, she has no personal life. Her needs for intimacy are met by studly male escorts, one of whom, Forde (Jake Lacy), becomes a regular. And as the interrogation led by a scowling senior senator (John Lithgow) continues, Forde is called to testify.Elizabeth is as chilly and enigmatic as Maya, the C.I.A. analyst Ms. Chastain played in “Zero Dark Thirty,” but with an added streak of ferocity. When under siege, she doesn’t disguise her arrogance and contempt, and she bullies underlings.But Elizabeth is not entirely unprincipled. When she and her colleagues at the Cole, Kravitz & Waterman consulting firm are approached by a National Rifle Association-like organization and asked to devise a campaign to make gun ownership more appealing to women, Elizabeth demurs. Having changed her views on gun ownership “somewhere between Columbine and Charleston,” she now supports background checks for gun buyers. To the fury of her boss (Sam Waterston), she refuses, exits Cole, Kravitz in a huff and joins a scrappy boutique firm on the opposite side of the issue.Despite her principles, you still have the uncomfortable feeling that winning a fight matters much more to Elizabeth than the issues involved. She thinks nothing of betraying a friend if it advances her cause. She pressures the film’s most sympathetic character, Esme Manucharian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a victim of gun violence, to tell her story on television.Partly because “Miss Sloane” is more a character study than a coherent political drama, it fumbles the issue it purports to address, and it eventually runs aground in a preposterous ending. In light of the recent presidential election, it all feels like small potatoes.“Miss Sloane” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and sexual situations. Running time: 2 hours 12 minutes.",0,3439171.0,3500605.0,0
222,2009-07-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:09,MANOHLA DARGIS,May-December Love Can Lead to Discontent,"“One who is abnormal must never feel abnormal,” the French novelist Colette once wrote to a friend. Instead, he or she thinks, “What is this world full of monstrous pigs who are different from me?” What words to live — or rather to write — by! Born in an age of corsets and legalized prejudice (1873-1954), Colette scandalized society with her colorful life, lovers of both sexes and demimonde characters. Her inspirations were artists not of the pen but of the bedroom, women whose idea of the bottom line, to quote the critic Judith Thurman, “was 50 thousand a year and a villa of one’s own — with a big garden, a great chef, and a pretty boy.”One such character is Léa de Lonval, the Parisian courtesan in Colette’s brilliant 1920 novel “Chéri” who’s played by Michelle Pfeiffer in a pretty adaptation from the director Stephen Frears. Over her long career as a professional coquette, Léa has reaped ample rewards and seemingly few serious regrets. Six years before the novel opens, she also acquired a much-younger lover, the fatal beauty of the book’s title — “a graceful demon” in Colette’s words, played by the striking Rupert Friend — whose appeal for her is as openly maternal as it is unabashedly erotic. Léa even goes so far as to call the affair an adoption, a description that seems rather less metaphoric whenever her “naughty child” rests his cheek on her breasts.The affair between Léa and Chéri is nudged into existence, perhaps knowingly, by her friend and his mother, Charlotte Peloux (Kathy Bates). Herself a former courtesan, Charlotte solicits Léa’s help with Chéri, a 19-year-old who’s cultivating his dissolution. With cheekbones so sharply angled they look like they could slice through a caressing hand, Chéri seems a perilous project. But Léa, who’s known him since he was a child, scoops him up as thoughtlessly as she would a puppy. Years later, the affair takes a sharp turn when he announces that his mother has arranged for him to marry a suitable prospect with a significant dowry, Edmée (Felicity Jones), an innocent who guilelessly upends this world.Decadence perfumes this deceptively tragic story. Much like the opium smoke that wafts through one scene, Léa and Chéri’s affair has left a great deal of wreckage in its seductive wake. It takes time to assess the damage, and Mr. Frears, working from Christopher Hampton’s intelligently compressed adaptation (the two were also united on the 1988 film “Dangerous Liaisons”), seems in no hurry to break the bad news. Working with the cinematographer Darius Khondji and a host of other talented artisans, he luxuriates in the Belle Époque milieu, with its sumptuous clothes, gaudy homes and heavily bloomed gardens, almost as self-indulgently as Léa lounges in bed. The camera lingers over the silks and furs with an almost sentimental attachment.Mr. Frears and Léa are each in the business of seduction, of course. And both are extremely gifted at what they do. What’s surprising, at least at first, is how eagerly Mr. Frears wants to please the audience or at least leave it untroubled. Though the film cannot rightly be characterized as soft — the cruel, often funny verbal barbs invest it with pleasurable prickliness — there’s a certain reserve, even hesitancy to his direction that in part may have something to do with the conundrum presented by Ms. Pfeiffer’s casting. After decades of pleasuring others, Léa now faces an empty bed, a state of declining affairs that has taken on extra resonance in the story’s transposition from page to screen.It’s perhaps inevitable that the film becomes something of a story about what happens to beautiful Hollywood stars. Ms. Pfeiffer is now 51, and her success has largely rested on a combination of extraordinary looks and an underlying fragility that dilutes the threat that great beauty can bring with it. No matter the role, with her watery eyes and slender limbs, she often seems on the verge of breaking. She can seem as brittle as a twig and just as easy to snap. At other times, you see the steeliness that comes with any sustained and successful movie career. In “Chéri” you see the frailty and the strength, yet you rarely experience either with the depth of feeling you might because of the palpable uneasiness surrounding her performance.That uneasiness is most evident in Mr. Frears’s decision to shoot Ms. Pfeiffer almost entirely in circumspect medium and long shot, as if she were a fine jewel in a shop window rather than a flesh-and-blood woman. Yet in flattering Ms. Pfeiffer, he also ends up insulting her talent. Even a lingering close-up of her face, which is meant to reveal how Chéri suddenly sees Léa in the harsh light of day, backfires and not only because, like most Hollywood stars of her age, Ms. Pfeiffer looks all of 40. There’s something poignant about the image of this actress sitting in a pool of sunlight without a smile or trace of visible makeup. But she’s trying to reach a character that her director seems intent to keep from her grasp.“Chéri” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Delivered by Tim Allen, this nonstop flow of tittering observations and nursery-level commentary feels sadly misjudged, a demeaning soundtrack that shreds the dignity of the animals it purports to celebrate.A uniquely up-close-and-personal glimpse of primates navigating a rarely seen habitat, in this case the lush Tai forest of Ivory Coast in Africa, the film observes a cartload of chimps as they eat, groom and eat some more. Its diminutive star is 3-year-old Oscar, unexpectedly orphaned during filming and subsequently adopted by the group’s hulking alpha male. This astonishing turn of events might have had more impact had the filmmakers, Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, noted (or been permitted to note) that young’uns like Oscar are as likely to wind up on an adult female’s dinner table as in the alpha’s nest.This squeamishness banishes all but the most vanilla facts and images. Aiming for toddlers — who, if those seated near me at the screening I attended were any indication, will quickly lose interest in Oscar’s snoozing, scratching and nut-cracking — the studio has ensured that conflict remains off screen and that violence is pushed to the margins. The hunting and consumption of a colobus monkey slides past at a discreet distance, and battles with a rival band of chimps play out in a blurred frenzy of lashing leaves.While no one is looking to traumatize the tykes, it’s galling that we have to wait for the end credits to catch a hint of the enormity of the filmmakers’ task. These brief, last-minute revelations of danger and discomfort suggest a shadow story infinitely more captivating than the one that’s actually on screen.",0,,27373646.0,0

In “Escobar: Paradise Lost,” no one is less likely to dazzle than Nick, the Canadian surfer who serves as our colorless conduit to Colombian crime.As played by the chronically inexpressive Josh Hutcherson, Nick is a willing deer in the headlights of Escobar’s intimidating physicality and manipulative charisma. Having arrived in Medellín with his brother (an infinitely more nuanced Brady Corbet), Nick immediately abandons their modest surfing school to pursue the charming Maria (Claudia Traisac, too often filmed as though starring in a fragrance commercial). That her Uncle Pablo (Benicio Del Toro) is the region’s most notorious cocaine kingpin proves no obstacle to Nick’s embrace of his new family or relocation to the cartel’s gargantuan compound.Set mostly in 1991, in the run-up to Escobar’s negotiated surrender to the authorities, this fact-studded fiction (written and directed by Andrea Di Stefano) cleverly avoids the burdens of the biopic. But the near-ruinous focus on the gormless Nick means far less than we’d like of Mr. Del Toro, whose majestic performance — a wily conspiracy of hooded eyes, crooning voice and thrusting gut — moors us to a story plagued by unconvincing leaps and unexplained decisions.Thanks to smoothly directed action sequences (and a delightful, 11th-hour performance from young Micke Moreno as a gutsy guide), the final act has energy and style. Nick might usurp most of the screen time, but it’s Mr. Del Toro, face flickering from benevolent to vicious and body heaving with literal and symbolic weight, who seizes the film.“Escobar: Paradise Lost” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Gabe has arranged for Osman to live with his mother (Melissa Leo), a police officer in a small California town where some shady things are going on in the backwoods. Osman gets a job with the local newspaper monitoring the police blotter, and he’s befriended by a longhaired free spirit (James Franco), whose disappearance Osman feels compelled to investigate.This isn’t a cookie-cutter whodunit, though; it’s really a study in Osman’s stranger-in-a-strange-land disorientation. Osman consults occasionally by phone with Gabe, who is still at work overseas, just as out of place in that hostile environment as Osman is in California.Mr. Olds drew on a documentary he made, “Fixer: The Taking of Ajmal Naqshbandi,” in creating “Burn Country,” which he wrote with Paul Felten. The story sometimes seems as if it’s being deliberately cryptic, which grows irksome after a while; Mr. Rains, Ms. Leo and Mr. Franco are all so interesting that you wish they had more to bite into.

O. SCOTT,Making a Living Handling Death,"It would be unfair to hold a grudge against Yojiro Takita’s “Departures” just because it won the Academy Award this year for best foreign-language film. Admirers of “Waltz With Bashir” and “The Class,” two exceptionally strong runners-up in that category, should not take their disappointment out on Mr. Takita’s entry, which  doesn’t require comparison  with those two formally innovative, thematically daring films. It is perfectly mediocre all on its own.Overlong, predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos, “Departures” is, in the end, interesting mainly as an index of the Academy’s hopelessly timid and conventional tastes. It operates, from start to finish, in a zone of emotional safety, touching on strong feelings like grief and loss without really engaging them, and wrapping itself in a protective membrane of tastefulness. Aided by the classical and pseudo-classical music that decorates the soundtrack, Mr. Takita, an auteur of Japanese soft-core “pink” cinema before he turned to more prestigious projects, has made a soft, pretty film streaked with just enough perversity to give it a vague coloration of art.Art happens to be one of the picture’s ostensible subjects. Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki), the smooth-faced protagonist, is a professional cellist who loses his job when his orchestra goes bankrupt.  He and his wife, Mika (Ryoko Hirosue), return to his hometown and move into the small, shut-down bar Daigo’s mother used to run. She has been dead for a few years, and the whereabouts of Daigo’s father, who walked out on the family when Daigo was a young boy, are unknown.But not all that hard to figure out, once the contours of the story (written by Kundo Koyama) become clear. Desperate for work, Daigo answers an advertisement and takes a job assisting Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a gruff old fellow who is in the business of preparing dead bodies for burial. The disreputable nature of this work makes Daigo something of a pariah, even to Mika, who can’t bear to think that the potential father of her children might earn his keep handling corpses.It is clear, though, that the ritual of washing and enrobing those bodies is  a rigorous, dignified craft and a source of solace for the bereaved. This is so clear, indeed, that whatever dramatic tension “Departures” might have had is almost immediately stifled. Daigo is such a nice, hard-working young man, and his mentor is so evidently kindly and wise that you never really believe that anyone could hold their vocations against them.And the movie is so innocuous that you can’t really hate it. There are touching moments, and some well-observed local details and a few interestingly eccentric minor characters. But every turn is signposted so far in advance that you may find yourself wishing for a fast-forward button to confirm your hunches about what’s going to happen. Life is too short to spend two hours waiting for confirmation of what you already knew and didn’t really believe in the first place.DEPARTURESOpens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.Directed by Yojiro Takita; written by Kundo Koyama; director of photography, Takeshi Hamada; edited by Akimasa Kawashima; music by Joe Hisaishi; production designer, Fumio Ogawa; produced by Toshiaki Nakazawa; released by Regent Releasing.

Like something that David Gordon Green might have made before being seduced by more generously financed projects, this fragile sophomore feature, written and directed by Steve Collins, reminds us that watching movies matters much more than listening to them.Employing only the sparsest dialogue, Mr. Collins trusts his precisely self-contained images (exquisitely photographed by Jeremy Saulnier) and the subtle skills of his actors to communicate the shifting emotions of an awkward love triangle. Its anchor is a gentle, wistful nanny (John Merriman) whose eyes radiate anxiety.Is it caused by his former girlfriend (Courtney Davis), a wounded redhead who seems constantly on the verge of blurting out the film’s title? Or does it have to do with the fun-loving third wheel (Macon Blair), who seems more in need of friendship than of romance?Unfolding in New England over four vibrantly represented seasons, “Feelings” is a small-scale wonder. Pivotal events play out in the spaces between scenes, leaving only emotional imprints that we interpret within a timeline that may not be entirely linear.Yet the performers are so convincing (if there were a special Oscar for the under 5’s, little Lilian Collins, the director’s daughter, would toddle away with it), and each moment is so richly detailed, that we are rarely confused.

O. SCOTT,"Review: In &#8216;Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,&#8217; a Comfort Zone That Cannot Last","The “me” in “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” is a Pittsburgh teenager named Greg, a gangly, sarcastic young man — not quite a misfit, but also not a member of any recognizable high school social grouping — with a special fondness for movies. Greg (Thomas Mann) and Earl (RJ Cyler), his best friend since childhood, spend their spare time remaking classic films on video, using stop-motion animation and silly costumes and giving the results groan-inducing punny titles. (Samples from their extensive catalog include “The 400 Bros,” “Monorash” and “Eyes Wide Butt.”)Their do-it-yourself hobby is a technologically updated, highbrow variation on the “Sweding” practiced by Jack Black and Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def) in Michel Gondry’s 2008 film “Be Kind Rewind.” But “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and adapted by Jesse Andrews from his own young-adult novel, doesn’t dabble in trippy Gondryesque surrealism. It has its quirks and improbabilities, but its sensibility is earnest and earthbound. Nor does it have much in common with the Criterion Collection canon that inspires Earl and Greg’s acts of homage. The kind of movie they inhabit — a terminal teen melodrama, a bittersweet coming-of-age story, a wishful tale of interracial friendship — is not the kind of movie they’d be likely to imitate.On paper, “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” should be dreadful. That’s not quite fair. On paper, Mr. Andrews’s book is lovely: sensitive and rueful and attuned to both the solipsism and the ethical seriousness of adolescence. But it’s also full of the sort of themes, emotions and situations that can turn maudlin and embarrassing on the way from page to screen. The self-conscious narrator, the kooky parents and above all the dying girl — these elements are likely to raise alarms among grown-up admirers of the auteurs whom Earl and Greg mock and revere.Speaking as one such cinephile, I will confess to experiencing some irritation at the start. But I found that my resistance slowly but decisively crumbled, thanks to Mr. Gomez-Rejon’s warm, low-key direction and the perceptive, lived-in performances of Mr. Mann, Mr. Cyler and Olivia Cooke as Rachel, the film’s third title character and its riskiest proposition.Rachel is not a close friend of Earl’s or Greg’s — just a classmate with cancer — until Greg’s mother (Connie Britton) insists that he start spending time with her. That awkward parental intrusion and the even more awkward greeting Greg receives from Rachel’s mother (Molly Shannon) are handled with humor and graceful realism. Other adults in the film — notably Greg’s dad (Nick Offerman) and Earl and Greg’s favorite teacher (Jon Bernthal) — are recognizable types from the world of teenage literature. And so, for that matter, are the young people, Rachel in particular. Her kinship with the heroines played by Shailene Woodley and Chloë-Grace Moretz in last summer’s dying-girl dramas “The Fault in Our Stars” and “If I Stay” is obvious. A similar morbid romanticism floats around her, an aura of tragic mystery deepened by her wry, impatient resistance to sentimentality.As I said, potentially awful stuff. But Mr. Gomez-Rejon turns down the melodramatic volume and slows the plot almost to the point of stasis. (The music, by Brian Eno with contributions from Nico Muhly, is also wielded gently and judiciously). “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” is about growing up, facing death, making and losing friends and other rites of passage, but it’s also, and more immediately, about drifting, hanging out, wasting time and succumbing to confusion. And it provides three young people in whose company it is a pleasure to drift and wonder and loaf.While the filmmakers are not above trying to wring a few tears, they don’t wage an all-out assault on your feelings. There is a notable absence of aggression and of the kind of manipulation that yanks adjectives like “devastating” from the laptops of unwitting reviewers. The film is touching and small, but also thoughtful and assured in a way that lingers after the inevitable tears have been shed and the obvious lessons learned.“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Tactful but truthful teenage language and behavior.",0,,6601163.0,1

But because Ali Larter plays Lisa, the movie’s psychotic lady-who-refuses-to-take-no-for-an-answer like a carbon copy of Glenn Close’s demonic temptress in the original, she succeeds in pushing buttons that make you root for her destruction and feel ashamed for doing so.As Lisa, a sultry office temp, puts the moves on Derek Charles (Idris Elba), a happily married investment banker, she wears an insinuating smirk that turns into a crazy rictus smile. Sidling up to Derek at a fancy bar and ordering two dirty martinis, she announces that she likes hers “filthy.”Watching her flash Derek the look of lust, a colleague offers the questionable observation that young women nowadays view the workplace as a sexual hunting ground, and that Lisa obviously has him “in her cross hairs.”There is no moral ambiguity in this dumbed-down rehash of the earlier movie, directed by Steve Shill from a screenplay by David Loughery. Unlike Michael Douglas’s cheating husband in “Fatal Attraction,” Derek never succumbs to Lisa’s advances, even when she follows him into a bathroom stall and throws herself on him like a wildcat.Derek has just moved into a beautiful house with his wife, Sharon (Beyoncé Knowles), and their young son. Until Lisa appears, their only immediate problem is whether to remove the mirror from the bedroom ceiling.At work, Derek is riding high, having just reeled in a $150 million account. For a while he succeeds in fending off Lisa. But just when he thinks she has abandoned her campaign, she trails him to a corporate retreat, where she poses as his wife to enter his hotel room and tries to kill herself with sleeping pills. After Lisa’s attempted suicide, Derek, who neglected to tell Sharon about the harassment, endures a domestic fall from grace. But this perfect husband and father isn’t down and out for long.The biggest difference between “Fatal Attraction” and “Obsessed” is the characterization of the threatened wife. Unlike the mousy, demure spouse played by Anne Archer in the original, Sharon is a pro-active woman warrior, to put it mildly. Largely in the background for the first two-thirds of the movie, Ms. Knowles strides to the center at the end when Sharon and Lisa have their inevitable knockdown, drag-out confrontation.The movie’s most disturbing aspect, of which the filmmakers could not have been unaware, is the physical resemblance between Mr. Elba and Ms. Larter to O.

Support. Music.” is a blessedly nimble journey from loss to reclamation.When the New York guitarist and songwriter Jason Crigler, 34, had a near-fatal brain hemorrhage in 2004, doctors were pessimistic. Faced with the prospect of a vegetative husband, his wife, Monica — three months pregnant with their first child — refused to despair; assisted by an indefatigable extended family, she set about the task of restoring his life.Combining tapes of therapy sessions with family-and-friend interviews, the director, Eric Daniel Metzgar, studiously avoids any downbeat notes. We witness no meltdowns or angry outbursts (the film was the family’s idea), just selfless dedication to round-the-clock care.“We raided the game stores for anything that would encourage him cognitively,” says Jason’s mother, Carol, exemplifying the movie’s tone of gung-ho determination. Behind all this attention, the patient is a shy, fragile figure difficult to connect to his pre-calamity glory. (“He was and is the go-to guy for a certain kind of music in New York,” says a fellow musician, Teddy Thompson.) Mr. Crigler might have commanded a Lower East Side stage, but this movie belongs to his family.LIFE. SUPPORT.

231,2015-04-10,The Longest Ride,"Britt Robertson, Scott Eastwood, Alan Alda, Jack Huston",USA,George Tillman Jr.,"Drama, Romance",English,33.0,123.0,"Nicholas Sparks (novel), Craig Bolotin (screenplay)",2015,7.1,66954.0,30.0,2017-11-02 04:18:21,A. O. SCOTT,"Review: In ‘The Longest Ride,’ the Nicholas Sparks Brand Endures","On the Box Office Mojo website, “The Longest Ride” is described in three words: “Brand: Nicholas Sparks.” That may be all you need to know. The film, directed by George Tillman Jr. (“Soul Food,” “The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete”), is the latest screen adaptation of work by an author whose stamp is unmistakable. To those familiar with his novels — and, more relevant to our purposes here, with the seacoast-and-sunlight, white-people-kissing-in-the-rain movies they have inspired — Mr. Sparks’s name evokes a genre, an aesthetic, a swoony, saccharine, weirdly compelling gestalt. A Nicholas Sparks movie is a romantic melodrama in which the road to enduring love is paved with complications, some preposterous, some life-threatening. The setting is usually North Carolina (unless tax incentives in other states inspire a change). In addition to coastal sunsets and kisses in the rain, you can expect most of the following things: an atmosphere of implicitly but not doctrinally Christian spirituality; a young couple from two different worlds (though both are white); at least one medical crisis; a death; a handful of bad characters whose badness is not quite visible to the main couple until it’s too late. These can be rival suitors, faithless friends, snooty relatives or just plain meanies. Their job is to add drama, and to collaborate with the unseen hand of fate to keep the plot in frantic motion. “The Longest Ride” is a bit of an anomaly in that it is almost entirely free of villains, apart from a fearsome bull named Rango. It’s nothing personal, of course. At the start of the movie, Rango throws a young rider named Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood), causing serious (though not looks-compromising) injury and derailing Luke’s ambitions to become the top bull rider on the rodeo circuit. It’s important to note here that Luke is motivated less by the drive for glory or sponsorship lucre than by the need to keep his family ranch going after the death of his father. Speaking of fathers, Mr. Eastwood’s resemblance to the younger, “Rawhide”-era incarnation of his own dad is downright uncanny: the line of the jaw, the hint of a smile, the as yet squintless blue eyes.At a competition a year after the Rango incident, those peepers connect with a pair of baby blues belonging to Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson), an art history major at Wake Forest University who has tagged along with some of her sorority sisters hoping to see “the hottest guys.” Not that Sophia is that kind of girl, any more than Luke is the kind of fellow who would be led astray by the rodeo groupies who fill the stands. He’s an old-fashioned guy, the kind who insists on buying the drinks and making the first phone call and who shows up for his first date with flowers and a plan for a moonlight lakeside barbecue picnic.But as I said: different worlds. Sophia, the daughter of Polish immigrants who grew up in New Jersey — her background may be the single least believable thing in the whole movie, which is saying a lot — has an internship lined up at a Manhattan art gallery. Luke is committed to staying on Rango’s back for eight seconds even if it kills him. (Which it might!) What kind of future could they have together?Of course you and I know the answer perfectly well — it involves kissing under a spray of water — though the events that reveal it are beyond ordinary powers of prediction. But the obstacles along the way seem trivial enough to make the story of their relationship fairly tedious, despite the charm and sincerity of the actors. Luckily, they meet Ira Levinson (Alan Alda), a widower whose chronicle of monogamous bliss is the mirror and prophecy of their own. As Ira recovers from a car accident, he reads from a collection of letters recounting his courtship and marriage. It’s not quite clear why he wrote so many letters to a woman he saw every day — letters that sometimes seem to narrate what they did together just a few hours before the time of composition — but it’s sweet that he saved them.My memory is not always as keen as it should be, but in my long and rich acquaintance with the Nicholas Sparks cinematic brand I don’t think I have ever heard one character wish another “Good Shabbos.” Ira and his bride, Ruth — played in flashbacks by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin, grandchildren of cinema royalty — are both Jewish, he the son of a small-town tailor in North Carolina, she a cultured and artistic refugee from Vienna. Different worlds. They meet in 1940. He goes to war and returns home with an inconvenient wound. Unable to have children, Ira and Ruth collect art, traveling to nearby Black Mountain College to buy paintings by real-life artists.The mid-20th-century avant-garde is as unexpected a presence in this kind of movie as the Hebrew prayer book, and these exotic elements — along with a remarkably pedigreed cast — give “The Longest Ride” the dollop of specialness that is a brand requirement. “The Last Song” had Miley Cyrus and baby sea turtles. “Nights in Rodanthe” had the word Rodanthe. “Dear John” and “The Lucky One” had the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. “The Notebook” had Gena Rowlands and the wettest kiss ever. “A Walk to Remember” had ... honestly I forget. Someone put together a listicle! That’s the kind of criticism this brand was made for.“The Longest Ride” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Cats, for instance, would keep rodents away from granaries. They were cared for by humans, but not coddled, maintaining a certain measure of independence. The street cats of Istanbul, who would probably be considered an animal-control problem in the United States, are, in a sense, throwbacks to those ancients.“Kedi” (“Feline”), a frequently enchanting documentary directed by Ceyda Torun, showcases some of these feline personalities and the humans who look after them. There’s a good deal of projection in the verbal accounts of the animals’ lives, but the movie, with its mobile camera low to the ground or looking down at cat-navigated rooftops, doesn’t do much to contradict the indirect anthropomorphizing. There’s a lot of action at piers and fish markets.One restaurant cat earns its love old-school style, by snaring vermin. Another is so meek (or haughty, depending on how you look at it) that it never enters the high-end delicatessen it’s made its home, but signals frantically at the window when it’s hungry. The movie is replete with ingeniously constructed mini-narratives, including a turf war. The mesmerizing score by Kira Fontana, interspersed with well-chosen Turkish pop, is a real asset.The movie hits a somber note near the end, noting that Istanbul’s modernization is crowding out both individuated neighborhoods and cats. The animals, one human says, can “rekindle our own slowly dying love of life.” That’s one way of putting it, I guess. In any event, I give “Kedi” four claws up.",1,,,0
233,2015-03-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:21,MANOHLA DARGIS,Review: ‘The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq’ Blurs Fiction and Reality,"The crumpled, ashen-faced man on screen stands on a corner in Paris alone and seemingly ignored. The world is not paying attention to Michel Houellebecq, save for the off-screen movie crew and us, of course. This probably doesn’t happen often to Mr. Houellebecq (pronounced WELL-beck), the French novelist whose putatively scandalous work touches on subjects — despair, sex tourism, cloning, Islamic political power, despair again — that seem calculated to provoke, especially, the humorless. A typically vulgar caricature of him was on the cover of the magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7, the day that two jihadists entered its Paris offices and set about slaughtering 12 people.A fictional movie or perhaps not exactly, “The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq” had its premiere at the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival, a year before the Charlie Hebdo killings. There’s no direct connection between the movie and the murders, but both are part of that contested terrain known as Michel Houellebecq. By this, I mean less the real Mr. Houellebecq (whoever he is) than that site in which writerly production meets intellectual validation or condemnation, vociferous public debate and political denunciation. It is this site, this authorial marker that is presumably on view in “The Kidnapping,” a divertingly eccentric, often comically absurd movie about a novelist, also named Michel Houellebecq, who finds something like happiness after being abducted. The apparent genesis for “Kidnapping” can be traced to 2011, when Mr. Houellebecq briefly went missing without explanation while promoting his novel “The Map and the Territory.” Rumors swirled, including one that he had been snatched by Al Qaeda. This proved false: “Michel Houellebecq has not been captured by Al Qaeda,” one  news outfit  assured anxious readers. Enter the French filmmaker Guillaume Nicloux, who, casually blurring nonfiction with fiction and shooting in remarkably ugly digital, has created a distinct, insistently light version of that disappearance. This lightness is especially strange, as is the movie’s comedy, which together make a dissonant counterpart to the now-familiar, deadly kidnappings by the likes of the Islamic State. The heaviness of the real world isn’t evident on screen; it just swirls around “The Kidnapping,” seeping through the cracks and into your consciousness. It opens unceremoniously with Michel, as our protagonist is known, speaking with another middle-aged man about an apartment renovation. Seated at a table, sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes, the men chat idly and to no evident narrative end. And so it goes for a while as Michel wanders here and there, speaks with other intimates and keeps things entertainingly hopping with his observations about J.G. Ballard, so-called Swedish fascism and Le Corbusier’s “concentration camp” architecture. And then three kidnappers corner Michel and — after pausing to see what he’s reading (Tocqueville) — sweep him off to the countryside.He lands in a modest house plunked down next to what looks to be a car junkyard and cordoned off by barbed wire. There, he becomes intimately, humorously and fraternally acquainted with his French-speaking kidnappers — played by Luc Schwarz, Mathieu Nicourt and Maxime Lefrançois, all called by their real first names — who pour him drinks, ask about his writing process and demonstrate their various bodybuilding and fight skills. Michel proves to be a demanding kidnapping victim: he asks for wine, food, cigarettes, a lighter, books. These he receives and more, including the warm company of the home’s owners, an old couple, Ginette (Ginette Suchotzky) and Dede (Andre Suchotzky). In time, Michel transforms into something of a guest — a contented, genially indulged one.Mr. Houellebecq’s readers may note that Ginette and Dede’s homey ministrations offer a piercing contrast with the parents in both his books and his biographical accounts. Ginette is such a warm bosom that she even asks Michel if he would like some pornography. At that point, Michel, who wanders the garden, wrestles a bit and smokes a lot, more or less has free rein of the house, a slyly horrifying kitsch-topia with display cases filled with beer steins and ornamental plates, and crammed with bric-a-brac and peach-colored accents. Michel says no to the porn but asks for a woman (Marie Bourjala as Fatima), who arrives to warm his bed and reassure us that this is Michel Houellebecq’s world, after all: preposterous, assaultive and tender.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,Characters Who Learn to See by Falling Into a World Without Sight,"In “Blindness,” Fernando Meirelles’s adaptation of the novel by the Nobel laureate José Saramago, human civilization is threatened by a sudden and virulent outbreak of metaphor. As people go about their daily lives in an unidentified city (a brilliantly shot, digitally tweaked composite of Toronto, Tokyo and São Paulo), they begin, one by one, to lose their sight. No organic cause can be found for this condition, which manifests itself not as a descent into darkness but as a whiteout, as if the world had become a blank page, an empty screen or a puddle of milk.Panic ensues, and the government quarantines the afflicted in an unused sanitarium, where they act out a pageant revealing the deep and ugly truths of human nature for the benefit of an audience encouraged to wonder What It All Means. We notice, first of all, the failures of compassion that greet the initial outbreak, and then, once the blind are sequestered, the decline of their makeshift society into a primordial condition of tribal war. We see decency, reason and fellow feeling challenged by stronger impulses toward domination and selfishness, and observe how goodness can triumph by means of violence and deceit.That none of this is meant to be taken literally is signaled by an ambient fuzziness familiar to anyone who has dabbled, as reader or writer, in the cloudy waters of literary allegory. “Blindness” concentrates on a small group of people, each with a thematic identity and a clear narrative function, not one with a name. When they stumble into the quarantine ward, these characters introduce themselves by number, according to order of arrival, and by profession, evidence that they have been stripped of their humanity not by sickness or the state, but rather by Mr. Saramago and by Don McKellar, the screenwriter.The main group, most of whom we have encountered at least briefly before their incarceration, includes an ophthalmologist and his wife (Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore); a prostitute (Alice Braga); a thief (Mr. McKellar); a mysterious old man (Danny Glover); a child (Mitchell Nye);  and a Japanese yuppie couple (Yusuke Iseya and Yoshino Kimura).Their rivals, quartered in another ward, are led by a bartender (Gael García Bernal), who turns himself into a cruel, capricious monarch and whose rise to power is aided by a lieutenant (Maury Chaykin) with the advantage of having been blind all his life.The ophthalmologist’s wife, meanwhile, has retained her sight (and stayed loyally at her husband’s side), which gives her tattered clan a bit of an edge in the struggle for domination and survival that occupies the film’s long middle section. Her condition also makes her a surrogate for the audience and the crucial ingredient in the film’s murky thematic stew. We wonder why she alone was spared. Is it because she was nice to her husband when he went blind? We also wonder whether, or how, her apparently limitless patience and pity will withstand the challenge of caring for a filthy and terrified accidental family.In its original incarnation as a novel, “Blindness” belongs with those other important 20th-century allegories that use an imagined communal disaster as the laboratory for a moral thought experiment. Other notable examples, drawn from the charmed circle of Nobel Prize winners, might include “The Plague” by Albert Camus and William Golding’s “Lord of the Flies.” Mr. Saramago’s book, lacking the dark simplicity of Camus’s fable, is more likely to join Mr. Golding’s well-worn novel as term paper fodder for high school English classes.An interesting transmutation sometimes occurs when the pedagogical machinery of this kind of book is brought to the screen. According to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, “an allegory is but a translation of abstract notions into a picture-language, which is itself nothing but an abstraction from objects of the senses.”This criticism applies perfectly well to Mr. Saramago’s novel, but Coleridge was writing almost a century before the movies brought this process full circle, restoring to these abstractions a degree of sensual immediacy he could never have foreseen.In other words, the characters in Mr. Meirelles’s film may be ciphers, as they are in the mechanical universe of Mr. Saramago’s novel, but they are also Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Alice Braga and the rest of those names listed in parentheses above. And this simple fact makes a big difference. Mr. Saramago’s lofty, ideologically defended humanism has no place for actual human beings, but actors of this caliber don’t know how to be anything else. Ms. Moore’s pale, fine-boned face is too precise and delicate an instrument to obey the rather simplistic directives of the story, and the rest of the cast shares her inability to sacrifice physical or psychological nuance in the service of vague ideas.Mr. Meirelles (a Brazilian filmmaker whose previous features include “City of God” and “The Constant Gardener”) sometimes seems overly enamored of arresting images, manipulating light, color and composition at the expense of emotional or narrative clarity. Here he revels in the paradox of trying to use a visual medium to convey the experience of sightlessness and excels at showing what the world of the blind might look like. And he is not above exploiting both the comical and the horrific aspects of their condition, punctuating scenes of cruelty and dread with moments of grimly funny slapstick.“Blindness” is not a great film, mainly because it can’t transcend — and, indeed, lays bare — the intellectual flimsiness of its source. But it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like. For all its chin-rubbing, brow-furrowing attitudes, it does not, in the end, give you much to think about. But there is, nonetheless, a lot here to see.“Blindness” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,She’s Not Impressed? Then You’re Not In,"The timing of “Admission,” Paul Weitz’s new comedy, is either clever or cruel — perhaps both. In the next few weeks, word will go forth from colleges across the land about who is in and who is out, as the American higher-education-industrial complex enacts its own Darwinian version of “Project Runway.” As the father of a high school junior, paying my tithe to the test prep gods while preparing to sacrifice most of my worldly goods on the altar of the liberal arts, I can’t tell if I’m part of the intended audience, or if the ratings board should issue a special warning for sensitive parents like me. How could anyone make light of the brutal, capricious system by which our young people are judged and sorted?And I must confess that I don’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed that “Admission,” which had the potential to be a sharp, satirical jab at the soft belly of middle-class anxiety, chose instead to be a warm and wacky fable of wish fulfillment. Mr. Weitz lines up a target placed at the explosive intersection of class, race, region and every other source of societal anguish, and then does not so much miss as aim in another direction — or several — letting fly a volley of darts that land as lightly as badminton birdies.Which is not to say that all of the humor is easy or gentle. There are a number of sly, precise jokes and observations at the expense of pushy parents, vain professors and compulsively striving youngsters. And there is Tina Fey, who captures the frustration of the modern professional woman almost as perfectly as Jack Lemmon channeled the strivings and failures of company men in an earlier era.Ms. Fey plays Portia Nathan, an admissions officer at Princeton who takes a certain sadistic pleasure in controlling the fates of aspiring undergraduates. But the application process is not the only arena of competition in her life. Portia and her office rival, Corinne (Gloria Reuben), are vying to succeed the soon-to-retire dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn), while the university itself is fighting to reclaim its place at the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. Meanwhile, Portia is defeated on the romantic battlefield, losing her unbearably smug English-professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen, looking like a tweedy, housebroken werewolf) to an aggressive and fertile Virginia Woolf scholar (Sonya Walger). That the phrase “Virginia Woolf scholar” is used several times as an epithet and a punch line is evidence of the film’s unusually acute interest in academic life and also, perhaps, of its ambivalence about feminism. It turns out that “Admission,” adapted by Karen Croner from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz, is less concerned with college than with the familiar, endlessly controversial predicament of women who dare to have both careers and children.Will Portia lean in? Opt out? Have it all? “Admission” tackles these types of questions in a breezily far-fetched manner, using a trusty conceit — the long-lost child of uncertain parentage — that proved useful to Shakespeare and the Romans. When Portia was an undergraduate (at Dartmouth), she had a baby that she gave up for adoption. Seventeen years later, on a recruiting visit to a granola academy somewhere in the Northeastern woods, she meets a talented, confused boy named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff), who she becomes convinced is her son.The one doing the convincing is John Pressman, a teacher at the school and a fellow Dartmouth alum, who has the good fortune of being played by Paul Rudd. Mr. Rudd is, as usual, a genial and disarming presence, smart but not too smart, cute but not too cute, and not bothering to do too much of anything that might look like acting. He does not try to compete with Ms. Fey as she bounces from furious hauteur to dizzy desperation but instead nimbly returns her volleys of comic energy.The two of them are fun to watch, though not as much fun as they might have been in a riskier, crazier movie. The best scenes belong to Lily Tomlin, brilliantly cast as Portia’s mother, an unbowed second-wave woman warrior with a pair of borzois and a Bella Abzug tattoo. In the history of American comedy, Ms. Tomlin sort of is Ms. Fey’s mother, and the on-screen ambivalence of the relationship gestures toward Ms. Fey’s complicated relationship with her precursors. (This theme was memorably explored in an episode of “30 Rock” featuring Carrie Fisher as a pioneering television writer who turns out to be a bitter, boozy wreck.)Mr. Weitz, with and without the collaboration of his brother, Chris, has a mellow, off-speed approach to screwball situations. What is disarming, and sometimes frustrating, about “Admission” is its niceness, an acceptance of the way things are that splits the difference between tolerance and complacency. Late in the game, the dean warns Portia that if some of the liberties she has taken in admitting Princeton’s new class were ever to come to light, “the whole system would fall apart.” “We wouldn’t want that,” she says, and though the film notes her sarcasm, it also essentially affirms her acceptance of the status quo. Mr. Weitz tends to regard potentially infuriating aspects of contemporary American society with more of a raised eyebrow than a clenched fist. “In Good Company,” his 2004 glance at predatory business practices, and “American Dreamz,” his 2006 musical mockery of Bush-era politics and reality television, are both notable for their niceness, and “Admission” is similarly nonconfrontational. And also strangely tentative, as if it could not quite figure out what kind of movie it wanted to be. “Just be yourself!” Portia would say. And then she would put it on the waiting list.“Admission” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Discreet sex, tame swearing and shocking SAT scores.",0,18000000.0,18007317.0,0

SCOTT,"Review: Richard Gere as ‘Norman,’ an Aspirational Fixer","The full, spoilerish title of Joseph Cedar’s new movie — “Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer” — is more or less literally accurate, though it might be argued that “fixer” is a bit euphemistic, if not downright fantastical. In his own mind, Norman Oppenheimer, a well-dressed, well-spoken Manhattanite played with feeling and mischief by Richard Gere, is what’s known in Yiddish as a macher. He travels the circuits of money and influence, always just a few capillaries removed from the beating heart of power. His mental Rolodex swells with the names of the good and the great, every one of them “a very close friend.” He’d be happy to introduce you.His alleged friends — financiers, captains of industry, political big shots in Washington and Tel Aviv — might reckon things differently. A rising Israeli politician named Micha Eshel (Lior Ashkenazi) describes Norman to an aide as “a warm Jew.” It’s the nicest thing anyone can say. The aide, an actual fixer named Duby (Yehuda Almagor), has other ideas. In his eyes Norman is, at best, a minor annoyance; at worst, a threat to his patron’s career.It’s no accident that some of Duby’s words about Norman — “scheming” and “bloodsucking,” in particular — evoke the historical language of anti-Semitism. Mr. Cedar, a New York-born Israeli filmmaker, has a sharp eye for intra-Jewish conflict, for the narcissism of large and small differences that can cause the unity of God’s chosen people to splinter like matzo. His previous film, the sublime academic comedy “Footnote,” mined father-son rivalry and scholarly antagonism for biblical pathos and borscht belt humor. “Norman” traces fault lines, more cultural and temperamental than ideological or religious, between the members of the diaspora (or at least the New York wing of it) and their cousins in the Promised Land.One of Mr. Cedar’s slyest conceptual jokes — and one of his boldest provocations at a moment of controversy about race and ethnicity in movie casting — is to place non-Jewish actors in most of the major American Jewish roles. (The Israelis are mostly Israeli, with the exception of Charlotte Gainsbourg, an ethereal embodiment of ethical seriousness and geographical nomadism.) In addition to Mr. Gere (who has never been better), there is Michael Sheen as Norman’s nephew. Steve Buscemi plays a rabbi. It would be a pleasure to write that sentence even if the performance it designates were not a marvel of wit and off-kilter humanity.Which pretty much describes “Norman” itself. It’s only after the plot has unfolded, with antic elegance and brazen unpredictability, that the risks involved become apparent. The dangers are everywhere: overly broad humor; obnoxiously shticky performances; sentimental tribalism; easy moral point-scoring. None materialize. It’s startling, given how much farce is on display — in the rise-and-fall structure of the narrative; in the madcap scenes of narrowly missed (or fully achieved) catastrophe; in the play of mistaken and forged identities — how much genuine feeling also comes through.It’s less that Mr. Cedar blends realism with absurdity than that he refuses to acknowledge any distinction between them. Norman, who strides through Midtown in a tweed cap and a camel coat, connected to the world through the earbuds of his iPhone, is an utterly plausible denizen of a city on the move. He is also a nearly mythical figure, a creature sprung from the annals of Jewish literature. You will encounter his ilk — losers, strivers, hucksters and dreamers — in the novels of Saul Bellow and the stories of Franz Kafka and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Also in the films of Mel Brooks and the Coen Brothers. At one point, Norman meets his own double, in the shambolic person of Hank Azaria.Strictly speaking, Norman is a con artist, a spinner of exaggerations, half-truths and outright lies. This may be the source of Micha’s affection for him: This future prime minister can produce his share of seductive rhetorical vapor, and the men also share an evident and endearing insecurity. They want to be liked, to matter not just in public affairs but to the people around them, too.And there is something almost selfless in Norman’s hustle. He doesn’t want wealth or power as much as he longs for proximity to them, for entree into a world where important things happen. He calls himself a businessman or a consultant, but he is really running a kind of social pyramid scheme, promising extravagant returns on small investments of kindness and courtesy.He almost succeeds. Or maybe — to give away as little as I can — he does succeed. Only at the very end, with thrilling subtlety and impressive clarity, does a fable blossom from the satirical earth.

When he finds his beloved cat dead — shot with a crossbow — he becomes a self-appointed private eye in the “Bored to Death” tradition and tries to solve the crime.The film’s best feature is its supporting cast, especially Nikki Reed as a woman who owned the same cat (it was moonlighting, alternating between the two homes), J. K. Simmons as the local sheriff, and Greg Kinnear as the owner of a Walmart-like store that figures prominently in the mystery.These secondary characters are fun, but Clinton is mostly annoying. It may be that this script read more amusingly than it plays, or that overuse has cost man-child characters their ability to be endearing. Whatever the reason, the film, a first feature from Gillian Greene (wife of the director Sam Raimi, a producer here), has to settle for “sometimes amusing comedy” when it was probably aiming for “cult hit.”",0,,,1
238,2008-09-26,Towelhead,"Summer Bishil, Chris Messina, Maria Bello, Peter Macdissi",USA,Alan Ball,Drama,"English, French, Arabic, Spanish",57.0,124.0,"Alan Ball (written for the screen by), Alicia Erian (novel)",2007,7.0,10855.0,49.0,2017-11-02 04:18:08,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Culture Wars Waged in Suburban Bedrooms,"It is hardly news that teenage sexuality is a subject that drives many people crazy. But how crazy? In “Towelhead,” a provocative satire of a culture that is paradoxically hypersexual and puritanical, it makes everyone bonkers. The men tend to be glowering beasts unable to keep their hands to themselves, and the female characters are either angry, judgmental watchdogs or witchy Lolitas not fully aware of their Circean powers.The movie, faithfully adapted from Alicia Erian’s novel, is the first film  directed by Alan  Ball, the creator of “Six Feet Under” (and of the new vampire series “True Blood”),  and screenwriter of “American Beauty.” Set during the first gulf war,  in a spanking-new, upscale housing development on the outskirts of Houston, “Towelhead” is a crude but scathing portrait of suburban life.In its preoccupations it might be described as “Son of ‘American Beauty.’ ”  If that first movie was a glum but polished man of the world, its offspring is a colicky baby who does a lot of screaming and yelling and banging of fists. Instead of the lush, well-tended landscape of “American Beauty,” the sterile tract housing of “Towelhead” is harshly ugly. The screenplay is talkier, and the acting more strident.Mr. Ball can’t resist indulging in the kind of titillation that the movie deplores. Although “Towelhead” doesn’t actually show female-genital shaving, the insertion of tampons and the putting on of condoms, it goes right to the brink before the camera cuts away. It does, however, show menstrual blood, masturbation and discarded condoms. More to the point, its characters, no matter what their age, obsess about such things to the exclusion of everything else.The misanthropy  of “Towelhead” is almost as uncontrolled as the male characters’ libidos. Even though Mr. Ball tries to humanize the men by showing their capacity for an awkward tenderness, the movie’s underlying attitude is that all men are dogs, especially when faced with virginal teenage flesh. Although the women are more sketchily drawn, with the exception of Toni Collette’s portrayal of a concerned neighbor in the housing development, they are viewed as avaricious bimbos.The hysteria all swirls around Jasira (Summer Bishil), a juicy 13-year-old Lebanese-American girl with a healthy sexual curiosity, whose classmates taunt her with names like “towelhead” and “camel jockey.” Her father, Rifat (Peter Macdissi), a divorced Lebanese-born engineer who works for NASA but retains a straitlaced Middle Eastern code of values, frets about Jasira’s budding sexuality and dream of becoming a centerfold.As the movie begins, Jasira moves to Houston from Syracuse,  where she has been living with her angry, embittered mother, Gail (Maria Bello). The catalyst for the move is inappropriate behavior toward the girl by Gail’s boyfriend, Barry (Chris Messina). On arriving in Texas, Jasira experiences immediate culture shock. Her father, observing her dressed like an ordinary American teenager, finds her outfit outrageously provocative and strikes her hard in the face.To Travis Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart), the married Army Reservist next door for whose bratty young son she baby-sits, Jasira is irresistible jailbait.  A classmate (Eugene Jones) is equally besotted; Rifat pronounces him off limits because he is black; Jasira rebels.“Towelhead” may have been conceived as a dark comedy, but it is rarely funny. It pointedly presents Rifat and Travis as an unlikely two of a kind. If one is an overprotective father, and the other a predator, both see Jasira as an inflammatory force of nature and tend to blame her for it.Rifat’s obsequious new girlfriend, Thena (Lynn Collins), and Travis’s nasty wife, Evelyn (Carrie Preston), are both all-American cheerleader types. The two men conspicuously fly American flags on their small, manicured lawns. Rifat  is a rah-rah American warmonger who hates Saddam Hussein with a passion.Jasira is a softer variation of Angela Hayes, the teasing, trash-talking cheerleader played by Mena Suvari in “American Beauty.” Like Angela, Jasira is not the person either her father or Travis sees through sexual eyes. Ms. Bishil, who is 20, creates a convincing portrait of a confused 13-year-old girl being manipulated from all sides.In its depiction of a hapless young woman as the flashpoint of a culture war, “Towelhead” recalls the superior “Citizen Ruth,” in which a young woman’s pregnancy rallies vociferous   forces on both sides of the abortion battle.Even more than in “American Beauty,” suburbia is portrayed as a hellish hothouse of repression and lust, where everyone minds everyone else’s business. In this overheated atmosphere the tension suggests the opposing worlds of “Wife Swap” and “Trading Spouses”  forced  together in a no-win conflict. The movie is a barely disguised hate letter to southern Texas.Because “Towelhead” is set in pre-9/11  America, almost a decade before the presidency of George W. Bush, it is also a period piece. Evangelical Christianity has yet to be mobilized as a national political force, and Islamic jihadism is only a murmur beyond the horizon. The cracks in the political landscape may have formed, but they have not opened into the chasms they are today.“Towelhead” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It has scenes of sexual abuse of a young girl  and clinical sexual talk.TOWELHEADOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Alan Ball; based on the novel by Alicia Erian; director of photography, Newton Thomas Sigel; edited by Andy Keir; music by Thomas Newman; production designer, James Chinlund; produced by Ted Hope and Mr. Ball; released by Warner Independent Pictures.

When Alice (Juno Temple) and John (Michael Angarano) acquire a teapot that spits out cash every time they hurt themselves, they leap into the good life through self-inflicted hard knocks but learn a valuable lesson when other people want their stuff.Cozily married, Alice and John are college-educated naïfs who are going nowhere and are ripe for temptation. (The movie joins a long line of wish-fulfillment comedies: the title even seems to refer to “The Brass Bottle,” the 1964 movie that inspired the TV show “I Dream of Jeannie.”) After a variety of painful antics, the ancient magical vessel makes them as rich as the snobby former classmates they used to hate.But the teapot, which is adorned with a Star of David, attracts attention from a Chinese scholar who warns against its evils; the couple’s ex-jock landlord, who catches on; and, in an unfortunate subplot, two violent Hasidic men who want their family heirloom back. And while John turns squeamish about the cash-for-pain lifestyle, Alice still wants it bad.The film’s director, Ramaa Mosley, and screenwriter, Tim Macy, who wrote a short story of the same name, have game leads in Ms. Temple (good at crazily curdled innocence) and the menschy Mr. Angarano. But the movie’s best bits lose out to the requisite moral turnaround. (When the two compete at delivering hurtful confessions, it opens a Pandora’s box far more interesting than the bouncy plot.) And the less said of the teapot’s World War II origins, the better.“The Brass Teapot” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some sexual content, language and drug use.",0,,,0
240,2015-01-16,Foxcatcher,"Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Sienna Miller",USA,Bennett Miller,"Biography, Drama, Sport","English, French",81.0,134.0,"E. Max Frye, Dan Futterman",2014,7.0,122870.0,87.0,2017-11-02 04:18:20,MANOHLA DARGIS, Taken Down by Twisted Ambition ,"In “Foxcatcher,” an eerie horror story about one American have and one have-not, a startlingly transformed Steve Carell plays John Eleuthère du Pont, the chemical company heir. A dabbler extraordinaire and apparent fantasist whose family fortune was partly created on battlefields across the world — as a producer of gun powder, dynamite and plutonium — the real du Pont collected monumental amounts of shells, birds and stamps as well as guns and, as the wealthy can do, other human beings. Among the most remarkable of these was an Olympic wrestler, Mark Schultz, who, as embodied by Channing Tatum, is the latest in a seemingly never-ending line of poetic male primitives.Much of what’s publicly known about the relationship between the real figures in this strange tale comes from news reports that broke after a catastrophically violent episode upended both their lives. Directed by Bennett Miller from a screenplay by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, “Foxcatcher” is prefaced by the common assurance that it’s based on a true story, although all the usual caveats apply, with changes, elisions and so forth. This is familiar ground for Mr. Miller, whose films include two fictions rooted in history, “Capote” and “Moneyball,” which, along with being just really good stories, take diagnostic pokes at the national character and its swamp of confusing, contradictory ideas about material success, hard work, self-invention and, inevitably, what it is to be a man.“Foxcatcher” has another good story, though it’s a slippery one. Beautifully acted and impeccably mounted, it is light on historical details and heavy on atmosphere, character and chintz. The first time you see Mark he’s alone in a gym wrestling with a grappling dummy, an apparatus that looks like an anthropomorphized boxing bag, complete with head and stubby arms. It’s a crude pas de deux, somewhat like watching Gene Kelly get frisky with a beanbag, and hypnotic because of its exotic choreography. It’s also off-putting because there’s something slightly comic and borderline pathetic about a man who is, for all intents and purposes, wrestling with himself. Soon after, Mark delivers a speech to some school kids — he wants to tell them about America — for which he earns a princely $20.You don’t hear much of what Mark, who’s most expressive when he’s grunting and grappling on a mat, says other than in 1984 he was a champion, winning the gold medal hanging from his neck. The scene cuts away before he’s finished his speech, but like his solitary wrestling, it helps establish the narrowness of his world and the movie’s thematic terrain. By the time a school official is writing Mark his $20 check, Mr. Miller has announced at least some of what he wants to tell us about America. Mark is so isolated visually and narratively that even when he eats — he scarfs fast food alone in his car, and slurps instant noodles in his grim apartment — there’s no question that you’re watching the emergence of a character’s existential condition rather than some guy chow down.The checks have many more zeros after Mark is summoned to the du Pont estate, a vast swath of prime real estate in Newtown Square, Pa. There, John has created a wrestling facility that he’s baptized Foxcatcher Farm, and which, through his patronage, he hopes or more rightly expects will lead to Olympic glory. Mark accepts the offer to live and train at Foxcatcher, dazzled by John’s wealth and quasi-religious pitch — a hash of patriotism, paternalism, entrepreneurialism and old-fashioned hucksterism. Despite Mark’s appeals, though, his older brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), himself a gifted wrestler who doesn’t want to uproot his family, declines to join the crusade. When John learns that he’s been turned down he pauses so long that it’s clear the word no is foreign to him. Much of “Foxcatcher” takes place at this increasingly unfunny funny farm, with its rolling hills, patrician veneer, expensive kitsch, tiptoeing servants, stable of horses and a wizened, wagging finger in the form of John’s disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Mr. Miller’s handling of the earlier stages in John and Mark’s relationship is impeccable and sometimes lightly, uneasily comic. Mr. Carell’s physical transformation is perverse, hypnotic and a touch distracting, and you may find yourself searching for the familiar face behind the pasty skin and large prosthetic nose that juts from John’s face like a cruel joke. Little by little, with long stares, an old man’s shuffle and strange phrasing, Mr. Carell transforms the character from a figure of ridicule into something truly grotesque.Mr. Miller, however, wants more than just an ordinary American sideshow, and he unwisely tries to expand the story when just telling it would have been enough. At times he seems to be trying to resurrect the idea of two Americas that’s crucial to “Capote,” which tracks Truman Capote’s investigation into the murder of an ordinary family by a pair of killers. But there’s no one here like Capote to guide you through the murk and no one who gives the spectacle of human struggle its spark, as the baseball savant Billy Beane does in “Moneyball.” Mark and John make a fine odd couple in “Foxcatcher” (things get seriously weird at the farm), but they never evolve into the kind of deep, meaningful figures who can carry the weight of Mr. Miller’s symbolism and all those American flags.Mr. Miller does his finest work with his three superb leads, though I wish he had made more room for Mr. Ruffalo, who enters and exits as Dave flashes in and out of Mark’s life. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the brothers, including an early one in which they train in their old gym, hitting and grasping in a pantomime of aggression and affection, the crowns of their heads touching like the antlers of young stags testing each other. It’s rare to see such physical male intimacy on screen, especially among men not bonded by war. And it’s in the depictions of this intimacy, in its tangle of bodies and desires — the images of John squirming on top of and below other men say more than any of his pitiful speeches — that “Foxcatcher” rises to the occasion of real tragedy. “Foxcatcher” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Virtually a chamber piece with just two primary characters, the movie dives into the black arts with methodical restraint and escalating unease.Unfolding almost entirely inside a remote house in the Welsh countryside, the story (also by Mr. Gavin) concerns a grieving mother named Sophia (a marvelous Catherine Walker). Sophia has paid a great deal of money to rent the neglected property. She has also hired a reluctant occultist, Joseph (Steve Oram, perfectly hostile), to guide her through a perilous, monthslong ritual that will allow her to speak with her dead son.Or will it? As motives shift and resolve weakens, the punishing purification rites and mental preparation begin to take their toll on characters whose flaws were already evident. Toadstools are eaten and blood is supped, but the procedures are neither particularly gory nor pornographically brutal. Focusing instead on psychological strain, Mr. Gavin, working with the cinematographer Cathal Watters, musters multiple shades of smoke and soot into a haunting evocation of a grief so disruptive it will rend the fabric between this world and the next.“A Dark Song” might be soaked in sorcery, but its true magic lies in its construction. Shot in just 20 days in and around Dublin, the movie has a spare, simple style and rhythms that mimic the characters’ heartbeats: steady and strong; racing and faint; irregular and jumpy. Not until the unexpectedly moving final moments do we realize what Mr. Gavin has been building to all along: not horror or carnage, but a quietly potent, carefully fostered sense of awe.",1,,,0

Thank heaven for a bubble-popping Joan Rivers, who blithely observes, “People who take fashion seriously are idiots.”Of greatest interest here are portraits of Bergdorf players: Linda Fargo, the sensible, influential and straight-talking if flamboyantly attired buyer; Betty Halbreich, a winningly acerbic in-house personal shopper; and David Hoey, who creates the renowned store windows. (The preparation of his stunning 2011 holiday displays is a highlight; passers-by take pictures of them like awe-struck peasants outside a castle.)Almost absent is conflict, except for a cursory account of recessionary speed bumps, the loss of clients after the Bernie Madoff scandal and the frustration of designers denied entry into the collections. The end credits offer a number from Barbra Streisand’s 1965 TV special in which she sings and dances in Bergdorf’s after hours.

Those convinced that faith can literally move mountains may welcome a film whose characters discuss spiritual issues, although there are no grand tectonic shifts in the landscape. In the film, directed by Mark Pellington (“Arlington Road”) from a screenplay by Albert Torres, the miracles wrought by feeling a mystical connection with a mysterious reddish stain on the side of a stucco house are less earthshaking and have to do with physical and mental health.That house is purchased by Henry Poole (Luke Wilson), a brooding American Everyman diagnosed with an unidentified terminal illness whose only visible symptoms are episodes of blotchy skin. Henry has returned to the Los Angeles neighborhood in which he grew up determined to die in slovenly solitude. While glumly waiting for the end, he comforts himself with vodka and Krispy Kreme doughnuts.To his annoyance, his pesky neighbors refuse to leave him alone. The most persistent is the garrulous Mexican-American widow who lives next door, Esperanza (Adriana Barraza). She is the first to notice the stain, which contains a spot from which a bloodlike substance slowly drips. Certain that she has seen the face of God, she summons her pastor, Father Salazar (George Lopez), to inspect it, and as word gets around, visitors begin arriving to worship at the supposedly holy site.Millie (Morgan Lily), an  8-year-old neighbor who hasn’t said a word since the breakup of her parents’ marriage, is also mysteriously drawn to the stain and miraculously begins talking again. Her beautiful, cookie-baking mother, Dawn (Radha Mitchell), just happens to be a perfect mate for Henry should he be roused from his morbid funk.As Henry engages in furious verbal skirmishes with the true believers, Mr. Wilson offers a credible portrait of an angry, despairing man fending off a cult. But the film’s spiritual deck is stacked.

Naturally mysterious, Rendlesham Forest in England — scene of a 1980 military palaver over claims of extraterrestrial activity — is the only character on screen worthy of attention. The other three are as riveting as you might expect metal-detecting enthusiasts to be, which is to say that the actors playing them do a fine job of making your eyes glaze over. Instantly forgettable, the gold-hunting expert (Robert Curtis), his generic squeeze (Abbie Salt) and her former boyfriend (Danny Shayler) trot to their doom, accompanied by a script (by the director, Daniel Simpson, and Adam Preston) that thinks lukewarm romantic tension is an acceptable substitute for a plot. En route to the big reveal (which is, unexpectedly, quite effective), our three ciphers are goosed by strange lights, ghostly cries and mutilated animals. Naturally, a pitch-black underground bunker must be explored, and a lightning storm demands that one adventurer stand on a hillock and wave his metal rod at the sky.These and other conundrums pepper the barging-around-in-circles scenario, but we can’t blame the actors. According to the publicity notes, Mr. Simpson sent them into the woods with limited information, then amused himself by scaring the bejesus out of them.

It’s a bummer because all he wants to do is please his father (Will Smith, Jaden’s father), a heroic if unfortunately named general, Cypher. Daddy Dearest has risen having honed tremendous self-control and a useful protective technique, “ghosting,” which renders him invisible to the monsters plaguing human civilization: the nonbearlike Ursa.These shrieking creatures are introduced in one of those opening expositional heaves that filmmakers use to sketch in the who, what, when, where and why, oh why. In this case, the back story goes, after ruining Earth, humans relocated to Nova Prime, where they wear a lot of white and decorate their homes with flowing sailcloths. It’s a nautical motif that winds though the movie, which was directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who wrote the script with Gary Whitta (“The Book of Eli”) from a story by Mr. Smith. There’s even a nod to “Moby-Dick” shortly before Cypher and Kitai’s spaceship crashes to Earth, throwing them together for the usual and less-so life lessons like: “Root yourself in this present moment. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.”Casual students of Scientology may find their ears pricking up at those maxims because fear and its overcoming receive a lot of play in “Dianetics,” a foundational text by the creator of Scientology, the pulp science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. “There are five ways in which a human being reacts toward a source of danger,” he wrote in “Dianetics.” “These are also the five courses he can take on any given problem.” These options are attack, flee, avoid, neglect or succumb. Kitai would understandably like to split — 1,000 years after humans abandoned Earth, he and Dad have landed on a now seemingly pristine, healed world teeming with cawing, clawing menace and some cute baby critters. But Cypher is made of sterner, righter, more rational stuff.The story kicks in slowly, beat by predictable beat, after a debris storm downs Kitai and Cypher’s spaceship and they fall to Earth in a smashup that looks like someone decorated the set with wet toilet paper and plastic wrap. There, they trade bitter words, clench their jaws and hold back the tears amid long pauses and inert action scenes, most involving Kitai racing through the dense woods and confronting digitally rendered animals. For the most part it is an uninteresting slog alleviated only by the occasional unintended laugh and moments of visual beauty. Mr. Shyamalan generally torpedoes his movies with overweening self-seriousness. But here and there he also offers up an image — as with a close-up of Kitai’s face dusted with glistening snowflakes — that rises out of the torpor. Those images are few and far between in a movie that loses its way long before Kitai reaches the belching volcano that leads to his inevitable destiny. Mr. Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, are producers on “After Earth,” which suggests that there was no one on the production who could really say no to him. An often affable screen presence, he spends much of the movie in a chair on the spaceship pursing his lips and watering his eyes. It’s a calamitously one-note, unpersuasive performance that’s a match to that of Jaden, a pretty teenager with jumpy eyebrows whose character remains an insufferable brat. Once upon a time, Hollywood parents gave their children sports cars as gifts. These days, apparently nothing less than a big-screen vanity project will do for Junior.“After Earth” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Summer blockbusters have a way of encouraging multiplex Manichaeism, though I propose a middle way. It won’t be easy. Even those who patiently ride out the bludgeoning excesses of the film’s final 45 minutes may wonder what happened to the movie — the one about human and humanoid struggles — they watched for the first 100. They may also wonder why no one, anyone, smacked the director, Zack Snyder, in the head and reminded him that he was midwifing a superhero franchise, as the film’s first image, of a yelling, straining woman signals, not restaging the end of days.Apocalypse Now (a movie that Mr. Snyder nods at), Apocalypse Then: The 21st century has been tough for Superman, at least at the box office. After decades of saving the world on the screen and on the page, the movie character seemed stuck, particularly after the dreary 2006 reboot, “Superman Returns.” The Superman story had been told in so many ways and in so many moods in the comics — he has married and mourned, died and been reborn — but shaping these transformative cycles into a new film, much less a viable series, remained elusive. Christopher Nolan went dark and then darker with another DC Comics legend in the Dark Knight films, but this was Superman, idealism embodied. What was there left to say about the man in the primary-color suit, especially after Sept. 11?For starters, return to basics, and add a fighting-trim Russell Crowe, a howlingly mad Michael Shannon, that emotional guidepost Amy Adams and a superdude — the British actor Henry Cavill — so ripped that he’s nearly shredded. Much like “Batman Begins,” the first part of the Dark Knight trilogy, “Man of Steel” narrates the how and why of its character, tracing an existential arc from child to man. The difference is that while Batman has to journey into the world (with a layover in a bat cave) to acquire his particular skill set, Superman comes fully loaded. He just needs to burrow into his innermost self, hang out at the Fortress of Solitude and meet the right woman.He does all that in “Man of Steel,” which was written by David S. Goyer from a story that he created with Mr. Nolan that extracts the canonical account from 75 years of seemingly infinitely layered supermythology. To that end, the film begins at the beginning, back on Krypton where Jor-El (Mr. Crowe) attempts to persuade its council, wearing dour expressions and ornate headdresses evocative of Gothic tracery, that their planet is doomed. It’s a measure of the film’s striking design here that the headdress latticework is echoed in some of the pleated clothing, as well as in the curvilinear buildings, suggesting that someone behind the scenes (the production designer is Alex McDowell) is an admirer of the architect Zaha Hadid and her flowing organic forms. These graceful contours are further picked up in spaceships that float like jellyfish and in suits of armor that evoke crustaceans, adding to this alien world’s striking conceptual unity. Lovely and imperious, the headdresses are also emblems of the countervailing forces that have led to the ruin of Krypton, a civilization undone by its own advances. The resemblances to Earth are blunt enough for an eco-savvy kindergartner and pop off the screen like speech balloons. But, then, this is Superman, and Mr. Snyder, whose earlier movies include a stillborn adaptation of the graphic novel “Watchmen,” is here playing with different narrative forms as he toggles between cinematic realism and the kind of comic-book-style exaggeration that distills ideas into images.The birth of Superman, who’s given the name Kal-El, opens the film and precedes Krypton’s end. Jor-El and his wife, Lara Lor-Van (the Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer), decide to rocket their child to Earth, sending him off to safety in the futuristic equivalent of Moses’ basket. Given that Superman’s creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, were Jewish, much has been written about Superman’s similarities to Moses (“el” is a Hebrew word for God), which is complicated by the character’s likeness to Jesus. (Superman’s Earth mom was originally named Mary.) Mr. Snyder, with his characteristic lack of subtlety, hits the Jesus angle amusingly hard, primarily in a later scene in which Superman — framed by a stained-glass tableau of a supplicating Jesus draped in a red robe — consults with a priest in a church. By then, the rocketing baby has become the man and given a soul-sick mien. That’s because the next time you see Kal-El after liftoff, he’s all grown up and toiling on a fishing boat off the northwest Canadian coast, a filmic ellipsis that abruptly spans decades. A beat later and he’s also shirtless and holding back a tower wobbling on a burning oil platform. And then, like Hercules who rises from his funeral pyre — having cast off his mortal body and assumed his godly form — Superman, a k a Clark Kent, is engulfed in flames. It’s a nifty, startling image, even if it transforms Mr. Cavill, a pretty man whose body has been inflated to Bluto-esque proportions, into barbecue beefcake. Mr. Snyder, perhaps intuiting how fast this image could slip away from him, cuts his way out of there fast.This superhero flambé aside, the oil platform is most notable for the workingmen Superman rescues, laboring brothers to the trapped coal miners who figure into one of his first comic-book outings in 1938. One of the pleasures of the Christopher Reeve “Superman” series, which took off in 1978 and bottomed out in 1987, was how the movies managed to be both charmingly old-fashioned and of their contemporary moment. There are a number of overt references to the past in “Man of Steel,” a title that itself summons up America’s lost industrial history. There’s even a scene in which Jor-El narrates Krypton’s rise and calamitous fall using immersive, metallic-gray images that morph and scroll across the frame like an animated version of a W.P.A. bas-relief mural.For roughly 100 minutes, or the running time of an average movie, Mr. Snyder is in control of his material. His handling of the story’s many flashbacks, which fill in piecemeal Superman’s Kansas childhood as Clark, is fluid and apt. Each return to the past becomes another tile in the mosaic, adding to the emerging portrait of the adult wanderer and seeker he has become. His adoptive parents, Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan (Kevin Costner), come into focus, as does the bewildered child (played by Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry), who doesn’t understand why he’s so different. Mr. Snyder borrows too many canted camera angles and too much sun-kissed fluttering laundry from Terrence Malick, but the Kansas scenes solidify the human foundation of a divided identity. To be human or not to be is Superman’s great question, a schism that evokes other familiar God-human divides. It’s one that he struggles with in his fights with an alien foe, General Zod (Mr. Shannon), and in his attraction to Lois Lane (Ms. Adams). It’s hard to believe that any actor could compete with Terence Stamp’s dandified turn as Zod in the 1978 “Superman,” but Mr. Shannon, delightfully embracing gnashing-teeth villainy, proves one of the new film’s strengths. A true Krypton believer, Zod has his own good reasons for chasing after the being he knows as Kal-El. While these add another layer, they and everything else are almost lost in the last 45 minutes, when Mr. Snyder piles on the hammering special effects, becoming yet one more director gone disappointingly amok.That’s too bad, because if you wave away all the computer-generated smoke and see past the pulverized buildings, it’s possible to remain hooked on the resonant origin story that wends through “Man of Steel” — that of the immigrant. It’s a story that begins with the launching of the spaceship and continues through a child’s pained attempts to assimilate and a young man’s sense of not belonging. In his excellent 1987 essay “What Makes Superman So Darned American,” Gary D. Engle wrote that “Superman raises the American immigrant experience to the level of religious myth.” Mr. Snyder isn’t capable of mythmaking, but in his sometimes poetic, sometimes crude way, he has given Superman a new lease on franchise life by affirming that this most American hero is also an alien yearning to breathe free.“Man of Steel” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

247,2017-05-12,Get Me Roger Stone,"Roger Stone, Donald J. Trump, Paul Manafort, Jeffrey Toobin",USA,"Dylan Bank, Daniel DiMauro, Morgan Pehme","Documentary, Biography",English,75.0,92.0,"Dylan Bank, Daniel DiMauro, Morgan Pehme",2017,7.4,4186.0,,2017-11-02 04:18:27,MANOHLA DARGIS,Review: ‘Get Me Roger Stone’ Profiles a President Whisperer in Peacock Mode,"Roger J. Stone Jr., the subject and star of “Get Me Roger Stone,” struts through this documentary with peacock feathers fully fanned. He’s first heard from a perch in some luxury digs, dressed in a tailored chalk-stripe suit with an olive martini at the ready. “My name is Roger Stone,” he says, “and I’m an agent provocateur.” The scene suggests James Bond cosplay, although it’s worth mentioning that the definition of an agent provocateur isn’t a supercool British fantasy spy but someone who persuades others to do wrong.So, who is Mr. Stone persuading? It’s an inevitable question given his relationship with President Trump and how Mr. Stone’s name just keeps popping up in the news churn. In a May 5 article in The New York Times, for starters, Mr. Stone confirmed that he was one of what the report called “high-profile Trump campaign associates” who’d been asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee “to hand over emails and other records of dealings with Russians as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election.” Mr. Stone said that he was “eager, indeed anxious, to testify in full public session, have requested no immunity and am ready to go.”Skip to this Tuesday, when President Trump fired James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., noting his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Mr. Stone, 64, a giddily freewheeling Twitter user, greeted this news with a series of tweets, including one with a GIF of Mr. Trump stamped “You’re Fired!” and another that reads “Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling.” On Wednesday, CNN reported that Mr. Stone had recommended that Mr. Trump fire Mr. Comey. The president responded via Twitter:Whatever else, this is killer timing for Netflix, which is releasing “Get Me Roger Stone” on Friday in theaters and via streaming. That’s especially true because in any other year and perhaps under any other administration, this documentary — the directors are Daniel DiMauro, Dylan Bank and Morgan Pehme — might have disappeared into the ether. But topicality is all or at least a large part of the movie’s draw. A sometimes illuminating, often slapdash and frustrating affair that mixes on-the-scenes bits, found material and original interviews (with the likes of Jeffrey Toobin), it opens with Mr. Trump accepting the presidential nomination in July 2016 and ends soon after his election. Much of the rest is a chronological march through Mr. Stone’s life, which is studded with scandal and boldfaced names like Roy Cohn.As it maps the road to Trumpville, the movie offers glimpses of Mr. Stone’s youth, including an oft-repeated story about a light-bulb encounter with Barry Goldwater’s book “The Conscience of a Conservative.” An ideological true believer is born who backs legal pot and has a few Nixon-theme bongs that he likes to show off along with his other Nixonian paraphernalia. After a brush with Watergate, Mr. Stone pokes around here and there; works for both of Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaigns; and helps establish a firm that grew into Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, one of a number of companies that earned the nickname “the torturers’ lobby” for repping countries condemned as human-rights abusers.The documentary also sketches a political family tree that could be its own movie and that has Cohn, the chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy, at its head and branches out to include Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone wasn’t yet 30 when he met Cohn in 1979. (At the time, Mr. Stone was helping to run Reagan’s presidential campaign.) Cohn served as Mr. Trump’s lawyer for years and, by many accounts, assumed the role of mentor. It was Cohn who introduced Mr. Stone to Mr. Trump; Mr. Stone decided that Mr. Trump was presidential material and, years later, has become identified as one of the president’s outside advisers.The movie spends considerable time tagging after the fast-moving Mr. Stone, tracking him from event to event, car to home to microphone, as when he swans into an outdoor rally during the 2016 Republican National Convention that registers as pro-Trump, though perhaps more anti-Clinton. There are signs and people milling about wearing shirts emblazoned with the words “Hillary for Prison”; for his part, the uncharacteristically underdressed Mr. Stone seems almost naked in a T-shirt with Bill Clinton’s smiling likeness and the word “rape.” The movie doesn’t at this point identify Alex Jones, the radio host and conspiracy theorist (the “Pizzagate” hoax), who can be seen hovering at Mr. Stone’s side.Mr. Jones isn’t formally identified until well into the movie, a careless, exasperating decision. Like other documentaries, this one crams found footage into punchy montage sequences held together by (not always identified) voice-overs. The problem with this clip-art approach is that it tends to turn history into cultural wallpaper, as in the section featuring images of the unnamed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who — with the help of Roy Cohn — were executed in 1953 after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage. In other areas, the lack of specificity raises questions that remain unanswered, as when an image of the Pentagon flashes by without explanation.Movies about colorful characters, be they saints or sinners, are often hijacked by their subject, so it’s unsurprising that Mr. Stone, with his bespoke suits and Nixon tattoo, owns this one from the get-go. An energetic tour guide and three-ring circus of one, he seems happiest in front of the camera, which in turn eagerly laps him up. It’s a familiar interdependency and, at times, this movie suggests that his most obvious talent is for self-promotion, one that’s been aided by the attention of the news media. Among the few journalists who seem to have really gotten under his thick skin was Wayne Barrett, an investigative reporter for The Village Voice who died in January.Mr. Stone has been providing journalists with copy for years. In 1985, Jacob Weisberg profiled him in The New Republic (“The State-of-the-Art Washington Sleazeball”), drawing a line from Mr. Stone’s lobbying work to those Reagan aides — Lyn Nofziger, Michael Deaver, Lee Atwater and Ed Rollins — who “have abandoned helping Reagan make conservative ideas reality in order to sell their connections to the highest bidders.” The journalist Jane Mayer (“Dark Money”) effectively picks up that same thread in the movie when she says, “Lobbying had been considered kind of a sleazy business, but Roger Stone unabashedly came out and said, ‘I’m going to make a pile of money off of this and no apologies.’”The indefatigable Mr. Stone continues to go go go, unapologetically. In January, he published his most recent book, “The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution.” On Monday, Alliance Strategies Group announced that it would “exclusively represent” Mr. Stone’s online presence for “digital advertising opportunities,” adding that he is “most well-known as President Donald Trump’s confidant and political adviser of over 40 years and often viewed as the architect of the Trump presidential strategy.”And on Friday, “Get Me Roger Stone” will do its part to extend Mr. Stone’s reach and his brand, both of which seem as unbounded as he does.",0,,,0
248,2008-07-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,MANOHLA DARGIS,Who’s Afraid of the Darkly Paranormal?,"I wanted to believe. But with his big-screen blowup of his great and weird television series “The X-Files,” Chris Carter has turned me into a reluctant skeptic. Baggy, draggy, oddly timed and strangely off the mark, “The X-Files: I Want to Believe” is the generally bad-news follow-up to the show’s first feature-film incarnation, “The X-Files.” Released in 1998 and directed by Rob Bowman, one of the show’s regular frontmen, that earlier film was a seamless translation of the series’s paranoid vibe and trademark geek cool. The series supersized nicely, filling the larger spatial dimensions by staying true to its conceptual parameters.Not that it isn’t swell to see Mulder and Scully, the Nick and Nora of paranormal freakouts  —  a k a David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson —  once again trading dark, searching looks under the cover of the long night, or even by bright eerie day. Mulder may be wearing a bushy beard (Mr. Carter builds up the character’s entrance so dramatically I expected something rather more leprous), and Scully looks thinner, more angled, a touch weary. But it’s still them, the sexy renegade agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who, for almost a decade, poked into strange goings-on, partly driven by Mulder’s belief that his sister had been kidnapped by extraterrestrials and partly by a work relationship that became something more.That relationship still simmers, though at a reduced temperature. There’s nothing stirring the air between Mulder and Scully, who, having left the bureau, come across as unmoored and unfocused, even when they’re working on the outlandish criminal case that drags them back into the twilight zone. A similar lack of urgency characterizes the movie, which despite its yowling dogs, barking Russians, screaming women, swelling choral voices and moody cinematography by Bill Roe — which turns even dark blue a deeper shade of black —  never finds a sustainable pulse. Mr. Carter knows how to grab your attention visually, but the amalgam of trashy thriller clichés that he has compiled with Frank Spotnitz, another series regular, creates its own deadening effect. It’s no wonder Mulder and Scully seem so diffident.The first “X-Files” movie, released before the show ended, added nothing substantive. It came off like a contract clause writ large, a shot at a potential franchise. The new film, Mr. Carter’s debut as a feature director, adds even less, but it won’t hurt the show’s legacy, at least among die-hard fans who appreciated it as a wittily sustained pop take on what the historian Richard Hofstadter has called “the paranoid style in American politics.” In the years since the show’s demise, American politics has grown all the more paranoid, an observation that Mr. Carter — who throws out an easy laugh about President Bush to no real purpose — might have run with instead of stumbling in less interesting directions.“The X-Files: I Want to Believe” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"A 50-Mile March, Nearly 50 Years Later","On the afternoon of March 7, 1965, Alabama state troopers and members of a Dallas County posse, armed with clubs, cattle prods and tear gas, attacked civil rights demonstrators on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. The marchers had planned to walk the 50 miles to Montgomery, the state capital, as part of a long-building protest against the denial of basic voting rights to Southern blacks. The procession would have crossed Lowndes County, where not a single African-American voter had been registered in more than 60 years. Efforts to change this had been met with bureaucratic obstruction, intimidation and lethal brutality, including the killing, a week earlier, of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old laborer and protester, by a state trooper.A few days later, a second march, led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., turned back rather than risk further violence. By the time the third, ultimately successful effort left Selma on March 21, President Lyndon B. Johnson, pushed by Dr. King and televised images of official brutality as well as by his own political and moral instincts, had introduced the Voting Rights Act in a nationally televised address to Congress. The above can serve as a partial plot summary of “Selma,” Ava DuVernay’s bold and bracingly self-assured new movie about the march and the events, in Selma and elsewhere, leading up to it. History does not come with spoilers — or spoiler alerts — but it does have a habit of setting traps for ambitious filmmakers. The most basic is the lack of clear beginnings and ends. To tell the story of the American civil rights movement properly, a conscientious director would have to plot a course from at least 1619, when the first enslaved Africans arrived, to this week.Narrowing the scope — “Selma” begins with Dr. King’s acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in December 1964 and ends in Montgomery a little more than three months later — poses its own challenges. How do you capture the chaos, uncertainty and sheer crowdedness of events without sacrificing coherence? How do you suggest what happened before and after? How do you endow a relatively well-known episode from the recent past with the urgency of the present tense?The answers are all up there on the screen. Ms. DuVernay, in her third feature (after “I Will Follow” and “Middle of Nowhere”), writes history with passionate clarity and blazing conviction. (The cinematographer, Bradford Young, captures its shadows and its glow.) Even if you think you know what’s coming, “Selma” hums with suspense and surprise. Packed with incident and overflowing with fascinating characters, it is a triumph of efficient, emphatic cinematic storytelling. And much more than that, of course: It would be hard to imagine a timelier, more necessary popular entertainment in the year of Ferguson, Mo., a reminder both of progress made and promises unkept. But such relevance is hardly automatic. A timid, pious or dishonest movie about the time-burnished glories of the civil rights era — the kind of soothing fable of awakened white conscience that Hollywood has too often favored — would not do anyone any good. Instead, Ms. DuVernay, working from a screenplay credited to Paul Webb, has stripped away layers of fond memory and retroactively imposed harmony to touch the raw, volatile political reality of the mid-1960s — the courage and the cravenness, the idealism and the calculation, the visible and invisible divisions and rivalries. Dr. King, played by David Oyelowo with the requisite grace and dignity and also with streaks of humor, weariness and doubt, occupies a central place in “Selma,” but the film is less interested in affirming his greatness than in understanding its sources and limitations, and in restoring his human dimensions.Dr. King’s heirs did not grant permission for his speeches to be quoted in “Selma,” and while this may be a blow to the film’s authenticity, Ms. DuVernay turns it into an advantage, a chance to see and hear him afresh. Mr. Oyelowo, a British actor of Nigerian background, has mastered the Southern inflections and preacherly cadences that have become part of the permanent soundtrack of our educational system, and the script offers credible paraphrases of his character’s unmatched eloquence. But this version of Dr. King is less an orator than an organizer. He is also, in his mid-30s, a man trying to navigate his public role, his private life and the expectations of his allies and friends. Ms. DuVernay’s portrait is astonishingly rich and nuanced, and it is very much a group portrait. We see Dr. King at home in Atlanta with his wife, Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo), confronting her worries about his safety and her suspicions of his infidelity. Those suspicions, handled with delicate candor, are fueled by the determination of J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), the F.B.I. director, to destroy a leader he views as a “political and moral degenerate.”Under constant surveillance — F.B.I. field reports typed onto the screen fill the audience in on his whereabouts — Dr. King travels a hectic circuit from pulpit to jail cell to the White House and back. There are many piquant moments of behind-the-scenes political theater in Washington and Montgomery: confrontations and colloquies between Dr. King and President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson); between the president and Gov. George C. Wallace (a gleeful Tim Roth); between Gov. Wallace and Al Lingo (Stephen Root), who led Alabama’s public safety department. But while “Selma” acknowledges the importance of men in power, its heart is with the activists on the ground in Selma.To say that an extraordinary group of actors supports Mr. Oyelowo’s performance — Oprah Winfrey, Wendell Pierce, Tessa Thompson, Henry G. Sanders and many more — is to state the obvious and also, somehow, to get it backward. Dr. King worked in the service of the movement, not the other way around, and Mr. Oyelowo’s quiet, attentive, reflective presence upholds this democratic principle by illuminating the contributions of those around him. I have rarely seen a historical film that felt so populous and full of life, so alert to the tendrils of narrative that spread beyond the frame. While entirely satisfying on its own, “Selma” seems to contain the seeds of at least a dozen other movies — a reminder of how fertile the civil rights era is and how poorly it has been explored by popular culture. Spike Lee and Denzel Washington gave us a fine Malcolm X (who shows up here briefly, played by Nigel Thatch), but how long will we have to wait for a biopic devoted to Bayard Rustin (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), Amelia Boynton (Lorraine Toussaint) or Andrew Young (Andre Holland)? Or for a daring director to tackle the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, whose internal tensions and impatience with Dr. King surface here in arguments between James Forman (Trai Byers) and the future Congressman John Lewis (Stephan James)? Where is the premium-cable mini-series about Diane Nash (Ms. Thompson) and James Bevel (Common)? The Martin Luther King-Ralph Abernathy (Colman Domingo) buddy movie? The “Law & Order” spinoff about the career of the Justice Department lawyer John Doar (Alessandro Nivola)? They are all here, in miniature, but “Selma” made me impatient for more.Impatience was one of Dr. King’s great virtues: His “Letter From Birmingham Jail” was published as a pamphlet with the title “Why We Can’t Wait.” “Selma” takes up his history with its eyes very much on the future, reminding us that the voting-rights victory nearly 50 years ago was not inevitable and is not yet complete. The nonviolent fight against white supremacy required not only righteous vision but also strategic insight and tactical discipline. The ideology that would sanction the beating and killing of black Americans who dared to assert their citizenship has not vanished, though its methods, language and partisan affiliations may have changed since 1965. “Selma” is not a manifesto, a battle cry or a history lesson. It’s a movie: warm, smart, generous and moving in two senses of the word. It will call forth tears of grief, anger, gratitude and hope. And like those pilgrims on the road to Montgomery, it does not rest. “Selma” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Violence, bigotry, brief cigarette smoking.",1,,52076908.0,1

Despite its vague title, “One Life” holds a clear focus across its transcontinental series of short, dramatic segments: the intricate survival behavior displayed by the planet’s cleverer beasts (and one plant). The film opens by comparing how seals, primates and frogs raise their young, but the most fascinating parts show not cuteness or stamina but tactics. Lammergeiers (elsewhere known as bearded vultures) break open bones to get at the marrow by dropping them from high above the Ethiopian highlands; capuchin monkeys crack open palm nuts with rocks; dolphins kick up undersea mud to flush fish out of the water and into the air. Nature-doc fans will recognize familiar sights too, like elephant calves in peril and fungus-growing ants.Though edited into bite-size segments to cater to short attention spans instead of attempting long-form Attenboroughesque observation, the high-definition filmmaking is skillful without getting too showy: clairvoyant camera angles on zigzag-sprinting elephant shrews, momentous overhead photography of humpback whales, super slow-motion, and heart-stopping long shots of a fox stalking an ibex kid on a cliff.Having Daniel Craig do the voice-over suits all the life-and-death problem solving. But the words spoken are distractingly unscientific. These beasts don’t mate and raise offspring; instead, we see a “dedicated single mother,” and an ape who after some strung-together reaction shots is deemed “actually a pretty good dad.” To one bird, in a phrase that sounds like a politician’s stump speech, “nothing is more important to him than family.”Ennobling, and gently humorous, commentary has long been part of nature documentary, but the continuum of man to beast is casually presented here as axiomatic. That muddies the waters in a documentary that really does complicate what we think birds, mammals and reptiles are capable of.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,A Golden Dollop of Motherly Comfort,"Adapted by Gina Prince-Bythewood from the best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd, “The Secret Life of Bees” unfolds in a sentimental, honey-glazed land that vaguely resembles South Carolina in 1964. It would be wrong to say that the troubles of that time and place have been wished away — on the contrary, the movie begins with a scene of horrific domestic violence and includes child abuse, a racially motivated beating, suicide and the threat of a lynching — but from the opening voice-over to the final credits,  every terror and sorrow is swaddled in warm, therapeutic comfort.The film insists so strenuously on its themes of redemption, tolerance, love and healing that it winds up defeating itself, and robbing Ms. Kidd’s already maudlin tale of its melodramatic heat. At first there is a jolt of pure Southern Gothic, as Dakota Fanning matter-of-factly tells us that when she was 4, she shot her mother dead. Ms. Fanning plays Lily, who, at the age of 14, when the story takes place, lives with her mean-drunk peach farmer dad, T. Ray (Paul Bettany). He tells her that her mother never loved her and makes her kneel on grits when she misbehaves.One night Lily, who dreams of being a writer and keeps a box of keepsakes buried in the orchard behind her house, runs away with Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson), a black employee of T. Ray’s who has been beaten and jailed for trying to register to vote. The two of them find their way to an upcountry town called Tiburon, where they are taken in by three beekeeping sisters named August (Queen Latifah), June (Alicia Keys) and May (Sophie Okonedo).May, who seems a little simple-minded, is also so deeply empathetic that her sisters have built a “wailing wall,”  where she can go to cry when the world’s grief overwhelms her, which is often. June, who plays the cello, is also a political activist (or at least a collector of N.A.A.C.P. T-shirts), and, as such, is a bit leery of the white girl who comes around in need of mothering. But August is a person of such boundless maternal wisdom and generosity that neither June nor Lily nor any of the million bees in August’s care need worry.Even as terrible things insist on happening, and the bigotry and suspicion of the era take their toll, worries are no match for matriarchal folk religion and the wisdom of the beehive. In its fuzzy linking of female power with insect life, “The Secret Life of Bees” shows a curious kinship with Neil LaBute’s ill-starred remake of “The Wicker Man,” but with nurturing African-American women in place of murderous white ones.In case they didn’t have enough problems of their own, August and her sisters also have Lily to deal with, and the film seems to struggle with an awkward and unstated tension. You can almost feel how badly it wants to be about the lives, not of bees, but of black women at a pivotal moment in the recent past.Despite Ms. Prince-Bythewood’s best efforts to retain a sense of history, and Queen Latifah’s shrewd refusal to play her character according to stereotype, the film becomes a familiar and tired fable of black selflessness, in which African-Americans take time out from their struggle against oppression to lift the battered self-esteem of white people who have the good sense not to be snarling bigots. Even Ms. Fanning, weeping on cue and looking uncomfortable otherwise, seems a little abashed that the movie, in the end, has to be all about her.“The Secret Life of Bees” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence and some profanity.THE SECRET LIFE OF BEESOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood; written by Ms. Prince-Bythewood, based on the novel by Sue Monk Kidd; director of photography, Rogier  Stoffers; edited by Terilyn A.

252,2017-03-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:27,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"Review: In ‘Cézanne et Moi,’ Zola and the Artist Are Pals. However ...","“With you I never know if I’m dealing with a dog, a cobra or a butterfly,” the writer Émile Zola (portrayed by Guillaume Canet) says out of frustration and impatience to the Post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne (Guillaume Gallienne) in “Cézanne et Moi.”The film, an intimate, searching portrait of the turbulent friendship between the two geniuses directed by Danièle Thompson (“Avenue Montaigne”), completely avoids the tone of pious reverence typically adopted in stories about famous artists and writers. Instead it focuses on the insecurity, competitiveness and complicated love lives of these two ambitious men of opposite temperament. Anyone who has spent much time in artistic and literary circles will recognize that this is how it is even today.“Cézanne et Moi” begins in 1888 in Médan, northwest of Paris, when Zola, then in his late 30s, was a world-famous author and the reputation of the late-blooming Cézanne was gathering steam. It then immediately flashes back to 1852, when they were rambunctious schoolboys, with Cézanne the daredevil who took Zola the follower under his wing. The movie restlessly jumps around in time, cramming almost more information than you can take in. And it is so eager not to come off as a lecture in art history the film presumes a high level of knowledge of French culture and history — more than most American viewers might possess.Mr. Gallienne, who dominates the film, gives an electrifying portrait of Cézanne as a scruffy, driven wild man who even as his career seems stalled, declares, “I’ll never stop painting; I’ll die painting.” Charismatic but scary, flashing a furious, wide-eyed glare that could turn people to stone, Cézanne is a foul-mouthed misogynistic boor and selfish voluptuary who shocked polite society with his profanity and who in his later years was obsessed with his declining virility.Although Cézanne played to the hilt the role of contemptuous bohemian rebel, he came from a wealthy family from which he was largely estranged. Zola, who was born in poverty, assiduously worked his way up the social ladder. Paradoxically, his raw realistic novels shocked the very bourgeoisie he professed to loathe but whose approval he eagerly courted.“Cézanne et Moi” offers a pungent, demystifying portrait of the rowdy late-19th-century Parisian art world where famous painters and poets mingled and jostled for position at dinner parties and art openings filled with shoptalk, backbiting and intrigue.It also makes a point of showing the profound self-doubt that led Cézanne to attack his canvases in fits of rage and Zola to consider destroying his manuscripts. Creativity for both men, who were acutely aware of their diminishing powers as they aged, is more agonizing than ecstatic.There is an abundance of gorgeous outdoor scenes, many set in Aix-en-Provence, where Cézanne is shown at work amid the fullness of nature. And famous paintings of the period are alluded to both in the dialogue and in shots that evoke the imagery of Manet’s masterpiece, “Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe.”Mr. Canet’s Zola, who resembles William Hurt in one of his more prim, buttoned-up roles, seems miscast as the author who maintains an unswerving loyalty to Cézanne in his life if not in his writing.The friendship is all but shattered with the publication of Zola’s novel “L’Oeuvre,” whose barely disguised portrait of Cézanne as a “castrated, defeated, pathetic loser,” in the painter’s words, hurts him to the quick. Even at the best of times, Cézanne views Zola as a timid romantic fool, at odds with his literary persona as a brutal social realist.Instead of trying to explain Cézanne’s vision and its evolution, the movie shows it in a remarkable final montage of his paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire, the ridge overlooking Aix-en-Provence that captivated his imagination. As Cézanne puts it in the film: “I like to paint the fluidity of air, the heat of the sun, the violence of the rocks.”",0,,,0

A roadie, Jimmy Testagross (a gruffly tender Ron Eldard), has crawled back to his childhood home in Forest Hills, Queens, after being cut free by his longtime employer, Blue Oyster Cult. From his wounded look it seems as if he weren’t only fired, but also stripped of his identity. Refusing to admit the truth, even to himself, he tells everyone he’s the band’s manager.Middle-aged losers and burnouts are a favorite of the movies, the sagging-gut analogues to all those bright young men struggling and invariably finding their ways despite the odds, their families and circumstances. As his name implies, Jimmy (it’s impossible to imagine anyone calling him James), hasn’t fully grown up, at least in the conventional sense of what it means to be an adult (no wife, no brood, no house). He’s throwing a tantrum when the movie opens, yelling into his cellphone about his old job and kicking a wall. There’s something juvenile about his outrage — he’s a hothead but with none of an adult man’s menace — an immaturity that implies weakness.This suggested softness turns out to be one of Jimmy’s strengths, as becomes clear from his interactions, particularly with his mother, simply known as Mom (Lois Smith), and an old high school bully, Randy (a very fine, blustering Bobby Cannavale). A large, initial stretch of the story involves Jimmy’s awkward reunion with his mother, who’s happy to see him and angry that it’s taken so long for him to visit. These scenes fill in the background and its bedeviling ghost (photographs of Jimmy’s dead father outnumber the religious tchotchkes), and vividly get across why it’s taken so long for Jimmy to return to that claustrophobic nest with its puce accent notes and tough love.Yet while the reunion works on an expository level, its awkwardness extends to the filmmaking. One problem is Jimmy and his mother’s dialogue, which continues in the same clichéd vein as the opening scenes of him alone yelling and yammering into his cell. People talk in platitudes, and their lives follow the same story beats as countless fictions. But when, early on, Jimmy yells that he was “the best roadie you ever had” and the next word out of his mouth is a questioning “hello,” it doesn’t simply indicate that the other party’s hung up on him but also that the screenwriters, the director Michael Cuesta and his brother Gerald Cuesta, aren’t working hard enough.Michael Cuesta’s filmmaking in the first hour is similarly uneven, most painfully during an ungainly conversation between mother and son that’s an argument for a ban on over-the-shoulder shots. Such shots are usually deployed when two characters are having a conversation. When the focus is on one character, the camera is placed right behind the second one’s shoulder (here it hovers behind the characters’ backs like a waiting servant); when the second character talks, the camera moves behind the other person, and so on. It’s a device that’s meant to make you feel part of the conversation, but when it’s as clumsily used as it is here, it can pull you right out. Mr. Cuesta, whose films include “L.I.E.,” is better than this inept scene.Things improve once Jimmy hooks up with Randy and his wife, Nikki (Jill Hennessy, also nice). Nikki and Jimmy were once close, and, as they lean into each other in his old bedroom, a time capsule lined with pictures of guitar gods and crammed with vinyl dreams, you see, hear and feel the film come alive. Mr. Eldard, who brings layers of complication to his character, makes Jimmy’s vulnerability palpable, while Ms. Hennessy shows you her character’s carelessness and opportunism. Nikki, who’s playing out her rock-star fantasies by warbling at a local bar, thinks that maybe Jimmy can do something for her. But Jimmy, despite his attenuated outlaw-biker getup, is too soft for real-life ugliness, which becomes clear in that motel room scene that shows you just what Mr. Cuesta can do.“Roadie” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

They come across a flame-scarred bus stuffed with burnt corpses and make it their home, venturing out to forage for scraps of food in the ravaged landscape.The boy discovers a notebook  left behind by a dead man (Hélio Fumo) whose village was destroyed by the gangs. Its pages tell of his loss and exile, and of a woman (Ilda Gonzalez) who is searching for her lost son. The orphan asks, could it be me? And as in “The Road,” he journeys toward the sea to discover his fate.From this bleak scenario, based on a novel by Mia Couto, the filmmaker Teresa Prata creates an affecting portrait of life during wartime. Ms. Prata, a skilled storyteller with a clear, unsentimental eye,  neatly balances large-scale horror with a small-scale point of view charged with simple, direct feeling, deftly interweaving the present-tense narrative with the tale from the journal.“Sleepwalking Land” has a dreamlike texture and intimations of magic realism, but its confrontation with the experience of war bespeaks a wide-awake mind.SLEEPWALKING LANDOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Teresa Prata; director of photography, Dominique Gentil; edited by Paulo Rebelo; music by Alex Goretzki; produced by Pandora Da Cunha Telles, António Da Cunha Telles and Camilo de Sousa; released by the Global Film Initiative.

Sealed in that world, Pim surreptitiously spritzes Yvette’s perfume and crushes painfully on his leather-jacketed best friend, Gino (Mathias Vergels). Burning looks in the garden shed lead to experimentation in a pup tent, but when Gino, a floppy-haired charmer, takes his experiments across the aisle, heartbreak is not far behind.Directed by Bavo Defurne (working from a novel by André Sollie), “North Sea Texas” is calm and rapt — no hysterical adolescent passions here — a simmering drama powered by fully drawn characters and fine performances. And with its indeterminate period setting and tarnished-sunlight glow (courtesy of the gifted cinematographer Anton Mertens), the film has a delicate, dreamlike quality that’s quite affecting.

This year’s model is “Gran Torino,” a sleek, muscle car of a movie Made in the U.S.A., in that industrial graveyard called Detroit. I’m not sure how he does it, but I don’t want him to stop. Not because every film is great — though, damn,  many are —  but because even the misfires show an urgent engagement with the tougher, messier, bigger questions of American life.Few Americans make movies about this country anymore, other than Mr. Eastwood, a man whose vitality as an artist shows no signs of waning, even in a nominally modest effort like “Gran Torino.” Part of this may be generational: Mr. Eastwood started as an actor in the old studio system, back when the major movie companies were still in the business of American life rather than just international properties.  Hollywood made movies for export then, of course, but part of what it exported was an idea of America as a democratic ideal, an idea of greatness which, however blinkered and false and occasionally freighted with pessimism, was persuasive simply because Gene Kelly and John Wayne were persuasive.While it’s easy to understand why the last eight years (or the last 50)  have made it difficult to sell that idea to the world or even the country,  it’s dispiriting that so many movies are disconnected from everyday experience, from economic worries to race. Pauline Kael used to beat up on Stanley Kramer, the director of earnest middlebrow entertainments like “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” but at least these movies had a connection to real life or an idea about it. Ms. Kael also famously branded Don Siegel’s “Dirty Harry” as “deeply immoral,” even fascistic, but the film became a classic because of its ambiguous engagement with American violence and masculinity. Mr. Eastwood and a .44 Magnum did their bit too.Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in “Gran Torino,” not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood’s face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood, in his performance as Walt Kowalski, expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls. A former auto worker at Ford, Walt has just put his longtime wife in the ground when the story opens. From his scowl, it looks as if he would like to join her.Instead he sits on his front porch chugging can after can of cheap beer in the company of his yellow Labrador, Daisy, watching the world at a safe distance with a squint and a stream of bitter commentary. Kept at bay, the remaining members of his family — including two sons with big houses, big cars, big waistlines — have no choice but to let him stew alone. Yet the rest of the world refuses to leave Walt be, despite his best efforts and grimace. The world first creeps into his peripheral vision, where a family of Hmong immigrants live in the rundown house next door; and then, through a series of unfortunate events, some artful and others creaking with scripted contrivance, it  stages a life-altering home invasion.Written by a newcomer, Nick Schenk, the story eases into gear with an act of desperation.Under violent threat from some Hmong gangbangers, the next-door neighbor’s teenage son, Thao (Bee Vang), tries and fails to steal Walt’s cherry 1972 Gran Torino, and in the bargain nearly loses his life to its angry, armed owner. Thao’s family, led by his mouthy, friendly sister, Sue (a very good Ahney Her), forces the teenager to do penance by working for Walt, an arrangement that pleases neither the man nor the boy. No one seems a more unlikely (or reluctant) father surrogate than Walt, a foulmouthed bigot with an unprintable epithet for every imaginable racial and ethnic group. Growling — often literally, “Grr, grr” — he resists the family’s overtures like a man under siege, walled in by years of suspicion, prejudice and habit.Walt assumes his protector role gradually, a transformation that at first plays in an often broadly comic key. Mr. Eastwood’s loose, at times very funny performance in the early part of the film is one of its great pleasures. While some of this enjoyment can be likened to spending time with an old friend, Mr. Eastwood is also an adept director of his own performances and, perhaps more important, a canny manipulator of his own iconographic presence. He knows that when we’re looking at him, we’re also seeing Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name and all his other outlaws and avenging angels who have roamed across the screen for the last half-century. All  these are embedded in his every furrow and gesture.These spectral figures, totems of masculinity and mementos from a heroic cinematic age, are what make this unassuming film — small in scale if not in the scope of its ideas — more than just a vendetta flick or an entertainment about a crazy coot and the exotic strangers next door. As the story unfolds and the gangbangers return and Walt reaches for his gun,  the film moves from comedy into drama and then tragedy and then into something completely unexpected. We’ve seen this western before, though not quite. Because this isn’t John Wayne near the end of the 20th century, but Clint Eastwood at the start of the still-new 21st, remaking the image of the hero for one more and perhaps final time, one generation of Americans making way for the next.That probably sounds heavier  than I mean, but “Gran Torino” doesn’t go down lightly. Despite all the jokes —  the scenes of Walt lighting up at female flattery and scrambling for Hmong delicacies —  the film has the feel of a requiem. Melancholy is etched in every long shot of Detroit’s decimated, emptied streets and in the faces of those who remain to still walk in them. Made in the 1960s and ’70s, the Gran Torino was never a great symbol of American automotive might, which makes Walt’s love for the car more poignant. It was made by an industry that now barely makes cars, in a city that hardly works, in a country that too often has felt recently as if it can’t do anything right anymore except, every so often, make a movie like this one.“Gran Torino” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some exceedingly foul language, a great many racist slurs and bloody violence.GRAN TORINOOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Clint Eastwood; written by Nick Schenk, based on a story by Dave Johannson and Mr. Schenk; director of photography, Tom Stern; edited by Joel Cox and Gary D.

SCOTT,"Review: ‘Before I Fall,’ a Melodramatic ‘Groundhog Day’","Samantha (Zoey Deutch) is the nicest member of a foursome of mean girls at a high school somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. “Before I Fall” takes place on the last day of her life. This is no spoiler: Samantha perishes in what has to be among the most heavily foreshadowed car accidents in recent movies, on a misty road in the dead of night. But then she wakes in a cycle of repetition reminiscent of “Groundhog Day,” living through the same sequence of events again and again until she gets it right.The film, directed by Ry Russo-Young, written by Maria Maggenti and based on Lauren Oliver’s young-adult novel, isn’t a comedy but rather a dutiful entry in the intermittently popular dying-girl melodrama genre. The damp, forested Pacific Northwest setting puts us in the “Twilight” zone. The mood of morbid, smiling-through-tears sentimentality recalls “The Fault in Our Stars,” “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” and “If I Stay.”The filmmakers take the sting out of death in two ways: by dissolving tragedy in a dubious, not-quite-religious metaphysical scheme and by making the principal characters so generic that they barely exist in the first place. Ms. Deutch is an alert and engaging performer, but Samantha is almost entirely devoid of interests, tastes or ideas.The people around her are a little more distinctive, but only because they have entirely conventional roles to fulfill, more like video game avatars than flesh-and-blood beings. Samantha has a mom and a dad and an annoying younger sister, a jerky boyfriend she’s planning on sleeping with for the first time, another boy who is not-so-secretly in love with her, and a squad of friends. They can be sorted into the wild one, the responsible one and the Queen Bee — identities that are signaled, day after day, by obvious behavioral cues. There is also a weird girl who is tormented by Samantha and her crew, and whose fate turns out to be the axis on which the movie’s world turns.“Before I Fall” is tactful rather than maudlin, tasteful rather than lurid, soothing rather than creepy. None of that is good news. Ms. Russo-Young’s earlier films (including “You Won’t Miss Me” and “Nobody Walks,” which she wrote with Lena Dunham) can be intriguingly oblique, using the natural diffidence of millennial characters to suggest hidden reservoirs of frustration, hostility, sorrow and desire. There is no such subtext here, no rough patches or sharp edges of individuality, and therefore nothing to care or wonder about. The twists are smoothed out, the dots are connected and the day finally ends, almost as if it had never happened at all.",0,12230741.0,12241072.0,0

SCOTT,One Bad Turn Deserves Another,"A mobbed-up poker game has been robbed, and the guys who did it — a twitchy ex-con (Scoot McNairy), his drug-addled Australian partner (Ben Mendelsohn) and the businessman (Vincent Curatola) who is the lame brains of the operation — need to be dealt with. That rough justice, to be carried out by a melancholy hit man after a series of philosophical conversations with various associates, is the main concern of “Killing Them Softly,” a grisly little crime movie directed by Andrew Dominik and based on the novel “Cogan’s Trade,” by George V. Higgins.In spite of the golden presence of Brad Pitt as the killer, a level-headed professional named Jackie Cogan, the movie has an agreeably scuzzy, small-time feeling. Shot in and around New Orleans but set (as far as can be surmised from accents, geographical references and the source material) in a broken-down Boston, it savors the company of losers, fixers and would-be wiseguys. And they are all guys, with the exception of a briefly encountered prostitute identified in the end credits by profession rather than by name.Higgins, who died in 1999 and whose book “The Friends of Eddie Coyle” was adapted into a first-rate movie starring Robert Mitchum, was a master of hard-boiled, world-weary macho dialogue. Mr. Dominik, who wrote “Killing Them Softly,” carefully transfers the novelist’s pungent idiom to the screen.Mr. Pitt is cool and detached, retreating from his emotionally open recent performances into the studied charisma of “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” (also directed by Mr. Dominik, in 2007) and leaving the emoting to others. His chief foils are an anxious, middle-management gangster played by Richard Jenkins and a sodden fellow hit man incarnated with rancid swagger by James Gandolfini. Ray Liotta, who frequently shows up in movies like this one, shows up as the guy who oversees the ill-starred poker game.It can be a pleasure to watch them all work, even in what turns out to be a disappointing job. Higgins was a genre magician. Mr. Dominik is a clever hand at genre pastiche, and the result is a movie, like “The Assassination of Jesse James,” that is sapped of vitality by its own self-conscious, curatorial fastidiousness. It takes place entirely in a universe of tropes and archetypes, which is a polite way of saying clichés and pretensions.There is one desperate, misguided attempt to drag the story toward some kind of contemporary relevance. Even though the cars, the attitudes and the overall griminess of the production design evoke a bygone era, “Killing Them Softly” unfolds at a specific moment in the recent past, namely the autumn of 2008, when the American financial system spun into crisis in the climactic weeks of the presidential campaign. The voices of George W. Bush, Henry Paulson and Barack Obama float into the action from televisions and radios, occasionally inspiring comments from the characters.It’s a clumsy device, a feint toward significance that nothing else in the movie earns. Perhaps the bankers and speculators who ruined the economy are linked in some way to the punks and lowlifes who ruin themselves, and maybe Cogan is the allegorical double of Ben Bernanke. Anything is possible, since the movie is more concerned with conjuring an aura of meaningfulness than with actually meaning anything.In the last scene Mr. Obama’s victory speech provokes a cynical tirade from Cogan, who scoffs, in a carefully nonpartisan fashion, at the president-elect’s idealism. “America isn’t a country; it’s a business,” this thoughtful killer declares, turning to one of his colleagues. “Now give me my money.”Fair enough. But it’s still a free country, and you don’t owe this movie anything.“Killing Them Softly” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Directed with heart by Eugene Jarecki, the movie is an insistently personal and political look at the war on drugs and its thousands of casualties, including those serving hard time for minor offenses. It is, Mr. Jarecki asserts — as he sifts through the data, weighs the evidence and checks in with those on both sides of the law — a war that has led to mass incarcerations characterized by profound racial disparities and that has created another front in the civil rights movement.The title of the documentary isn’t purely metaphoric. “The House I Live In” is, for starters, the name of a song written by Lewis Allan and the blacklisted Earl Robinson (“All races and religions/That’s America to me”), that became a part of the Paul Robeson songbook. Frank Sinatra sang it in a 1945 short film of the same title that is a plea for tolerance written by Albert Maltz, one of the Hollywood 10. Mr. Jarecki uses the Robeson version over the final credits of the documentary, a nod to that singer’s long history of civil rights activism. Touchingly, the song also serves as Mr. Jarecki’s plaintive acknowledgment that his documentary was directly inspired by his lifelong relationship with an African-American woman who worked for his family, Nannie Jeter (her real name).Ms. Jeter was, Mr. Jarecki says early, “like a second mother” to him when he was growing up. On its face and unexamined, that statement could be a perilous, risible gambit, but Mr. Jarecki navigates skillfully through the complexities of his relationship with Ms. Jeter, partly by immediately addressing his own privilege. She entered his life shortly after he was born, and their worlds overlapped as the decades passed.“Our families were close, and her children and grandchildren were my playmates growing up,” Mr. Jarecki says, his voice wafting over images of Ms. Jeter and her family closely watching television coverage of the 2008 presidential election. “But as we got older,” Mr. Jarecki continues, “I saw many of them struggling with poverty, joblessness, crime and worse.”When he asked Ms. Jeter what she thought “had gone wrong,” her answer — drugs — surprised him. Whether Mr. Jarecki was as surprised as he states is immaterial to how he uses this relationship between a white man and his long-term black caretaker to build an argument about drugs in America and, more critically, about race and class. Nothing in the movie, including the data he amasses, the history he excavates and the miles he racks up during his investigation, is as striking as his decision to risk seeming naïve or worse by making himself part of the story. Yet it is precisely his insistence that this is the house that he, too, lives in that helps distinguish this movie, investing it with resonant feeling.It may be a war that Mr. Jarecki noticed almost by accident, but it’s one he has seized on with characteristic vigor. As he showed in earlier documentaries like “The Trials of Henry Kissinger” and “Why We Fight” (about the military-industrial complex), Mr. Jarecki is fearless about taking on sprawling subjects that could eat up 10 hours on cable and squeezing them into feature-length packages. The war on drugs, which officially stretches back to the Nixon administration, is the kind of large-scale topic that Mr. Jarecki loves digging into, and he does so here effectively, showing and telling with a wealth of rapidly shuffled visual material, including judiciously deployed family photographs and home movies, newsreels, television news reports and the archival like.Working again with the film editor Paul Frost, Mr. Jarecki smoothly folds these images in with dizzying statistics and a cavalcade of talking-head interviews with a range of sympathetic experts, including Michelle Alexander, the author of “The New Jim Crow.” He also checks in with a psychologist, as well as with historians, legal professionals, prisoner advocates and inmates. Among the most important collaborators he taps for explanatory duties is the journalist turned pop-culture god David Simon, the creator of “The Wire.” Receiving what seems to be more screen time than any interviewee, Mr. Simon makes at once a fine, friendly narrative guide; a restrained voice of moral outrage; and, as the movie builds to its sweeping conclusions, a conspicuous stand-in for Mr. Jarecki.Those conclusions won’t surprise those who keep up on the war on drugs and debates over mass incarceration. But Mr. Jarecki isn’t a journalist and doesn’t pretend that he’s breaking news; he is instead something of a showman (the choice of Mr. Simon as a voice of reason over a generic graybeard is savvy) as well as a great synthesizer and storyteller whose nonobjective investment in this material is one of his strengths.It’s easy to take issue with a documentary like “The House I Live In,” which tackles too much in too brief a time and glosses over complexities, yet this is also a model of the ambitious, vitalizing activist work that exists to stir the sleeping to wake.",1,210752.0,,0

Based on the foundational book in Stephenie Meyer’s best-selling multivolume series, “The Twilight Saga” (four doorstops and counting), this carefully faithful adaptation traces the sighs and whispers, the shy glances and furious glares of two unlikely teenage lovers who fall into each other’s pale, pale arms amid swirling hormones, raging instincts, high school dramas and oh-so-confusing feelings, like, OMG he’s SO HOT!! Does he like ME?? Will he KILL me??? I don’t CARE!!! :)And, reader, she doesn’t, the she being Bella (for Isabella) Swan, played with tremulous intensity and a slight snarl by Kristen Stewart. A sylph with a watchful, sometimes wary gaze who’s often cast in daughter roles, Ms. Stewart transformed from an appealing actress into something more complex with her brief, memorable turn in the 2007 movie of Jon Krakauer’s book “Into the Wild.” As the child-woman whose longing for the ill-fated wanderer Christopher McCandless is largely expressed through piercing looks and sensitive strumming, Ms. Stewart gave form and feeling to the possibility that the search for freedom and authentic experiences can be found in the embrace of another human being. This was a girl worth living for, if not for that film’s lost soul.Since living really isn’t an option for Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the moody, darkly brooding vampire who catches Bella’s eye and then her heart, she becomes the girl worth fighting for, a battle that, as in the book, involves not just malignant forces, but also ravenous appetite. Like all vampire stories, “Twilight” is about repressed desire and untamed hunger and the possibility of blood, the blood that flows from violently pierced necks and that, from John Polidori’s 1819 short novel “The Vampyre” to Alan Ball’s new HBO series, “True Blood,” represents ravishment of a more graphic kind. This is the ravishment that, in its pantomime of seduction and surrender, transforms innocence — like that of Bram Stoker’s sacrificial virgin, Lucy, in “Dracula” — into “voluptuous wantonness.”Ms. Meyer’s contribution to the vampire chronicles, the trick that transformed her into a best-selling brand, has been to stanch this sanguineous emission, turning a hot human flow into something less threatening and morally sticky. Edward, you see, burns but doesn’t bite. As in the book, he leads a numbingly quiet, respectable life with his vampire family in Forks, a small Washington town under a near-permanent cloud cover. His father, Carlisle (Peter Facinelli), a doctor with a ghostly pallor and silky gait, tends to the living, while the rest of the brood, including his monochromatic mother and siblings, strike pretty poses, play baseball (in thunder and lightning) and occasionally hunt for animals. We think of ourselves as vegetarians, Edward jokes.It’s no wonder he looks famished. When Edward first meets Bella, who has moved to Forks to live with her father (Billy Burke), he glowers at her threateningly, his hands clenching into fists. Bella is mystified, and you might be too, if Melissa Rosenberg’s screenplay didn’t turn up the volume as the teenagers grow closer and Edward hints at his true nature. “What if I’m the bad guy?” he asks. (Cue the shrieking virgins.) “I still don’t know if I can control myself,” he later confesses, as someone’s guitar gently weeps. A self-described monster, he has all kinds of cool, superhuman powers (running, leaping, mind-reading), but nothing compares to how he masters his universe: he keeps his fangs in his mouth.That may make him catnip to anyone with OJD (obsessive Jonas Brothers disorder), but it also means he’s a bore, despite the efforts of the capable and exotically beautiful Mr. Pattinson. (The actor first broke hearts as the martyred Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter cycle.) Though her filmmaking can be shaky, the director Catherine Hardwicke has an eye for pretty young things and a feel for the private worlds that younger people make for themselves. But she’s working in shackles here. In her best movie, “Lords of Dogtown,” about the birth of the modern skateboard movement, a teenage boy sneaks out at night by slaloming off a roof while holding a surfboard. It’s a blissful declaration of freedom, including freedom from the big parental no.Though Edward and Bella reach certain heights in “Twilight,” notably during a charming scene that finds them leaping from piney treetop to treetop against the spectacular wilderness backdrop, the story’s moral undertow keeps dragging them down. If Ms. Meyer has made the vampire story safe for her readers (and their parents) — the sole real menace comes from a half-baked subplot involving some swaggering vampires who like their steak saignant and human — it’s only because she suggests that there actually is something worse than death, especially for teenagers: sex. Faced with the partially clad Bella (who would bite if she could), Edward recoils from her like a distraught Victorian. Like Ms. Hardwicke, the poor boy has been defanged and almost entirely drained. He’s so lifeless, he might as well be dead — oops, he already is.“Twilight” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog, unplugging Daddy’s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house, a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator, which strands the family on a Spanish roadside, can halt the fun: Within minutes, an impromptu fiesta, complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers, has materialized to keep them company.Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained, Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum, while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson’s screenplay demands.In only one scene do we feel genuinely moved, as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It’s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed. For a movie about an extraordinary couple who rarely played it safe, “Breathe” is all too content to do just that.",0,475685.0,489322.0,0

Mr. Vaughn then went on to direct a Ritchie-esque gangster flick of his own, “Layer Cake,” now best remembered for Daniel Craig’s star-making turn. Since then, Mr. Vaughn has directed the ultraviolent “Kick-Ass” movies and a franchise reboot (“X-Men: First Class”), both of which have raked in enough cash to assure that he’ll be running amok for a while. He’s developed into an adequate if often generic manager of action and bodies, but his real talent is for delivering extreme violence with a shrug and a smile.The problem is that Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn’t use violence; he squanders it. Some directors overdo it with crane shots, close-ups and dissolves, but Mr. Vaughn gorges on splatter, splashing rooms with red until it’s the only color and emotional note left. His love for guns and guts at least made sense in the “Kick-Ass” movies, mondo fairy tales about a child killer who locks and loads on the run. But his lack of modulation ruins “Kingsman,” which is based on a comic book by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, and was written by Mr. Vaughn with his frequent collaborator Jane Goldman.That’s too bad, because someone here has assembled a fine cast led by Colin Firth, who plays a spy in an agency hidden behind (and beneath) a Savile Row tailor shop where he swaps tradecraft secrets with Michael Caine, Mark Strong and the charming newcomer Taron Egerton. A lisping Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain, an American zillionaire with a henchwoman (Sofia Boutella) who, like Oscar Pistorius, uses leg prosthetics, though ones that are sharp enough to slice a man in half as cleanly as if he were an overcooked Easter ham. Nothing excites Mr. Vaughn as a director more than turning this chick loose, especially in slow motion with a gun in her pretty hand.“Kingsman: The Secret Service” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

(This movie is in fact a revised compilation of the programs.)At one point, Mr. Zahedi mentions a failed project about the artist Joseph Cornell. It’s possibly the most shocking statement in this often jaw-dropping movie. In a nearly three-decade career, Mr. Zahedi has only ever made films about himself. His most frequently cited picture, “I Am a Sex Addict,” from 2006, is as accurately titled as this presentation. Mr. Zahedi’s onscreen persona is all about absolute discomfiting candidness. “People don’t love honesty,” he notes, while he’s stubbornly committed to complete disclosure in his art. And not just for himself. This proves maddening for his collaborators, some of whom are played by actors and others appearing as themselves. His teaching career is threatened. Things also get hectic for his wife.This is an undeniably fascinating film despite, or perhaps because of, the repellent actions Mr. Zahedi depicts himself taking. “The Show About the Show” contains ostensible cinéma vérité footage, staged re-enactments of events and re-enactments of re-enactments. It gets a bit dizzying. And it features a vast array of New York indie film luminaries — the “Girls” actor and filmmaker Alex Karpovsky and the critics Eric Kohn and Godfrey Cheshire.But Mr. Zahedi remains the focal point. For all his candor, there’s something sinister about him. His refusal to acknowledge the plain implications of what honesty on his terms demands suggests someone whose evident disingenuousness masks something even worse.",0,,,0

That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” and later for many years on “Hollywood Squares.” In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her — and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.",0,,,0
266,2008-10-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,A. O. SCOTT,Tale of a Marathon and Its Guiding Hand,"The New York City Marathon is one of those institutions that seems to have always been around. Every November, throngs of runners gather at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and crowds of spectators line the route that snakes through Brooklyn and the western edge of Queens before dipping into Upper Manhattan and the Bronx and ending in Central Park. A new documentary, “Run for Your Life,” offers a salutary and touching reminder that the race, like nearly everything else great about New York City, was largely the creation of an odd, stubborn visionary.Until his death from brain cancer in 1994, Fred Lebow was more than just the director of the race and the president of New York Road Runners. He was a fixture of city life, instantly recognizable for his skinny frame, neat beard and ever-present cycling cap. An immigrant from Romania (where he was born Fischl Lebowitz) with a background in the garment business, Lebow helped turn running from a solitary and eccentric pursuit into a major sport and a staple of American culture.He did this with a mixture of showmanship, quasi-evangelical zeal and entrepreneurial hustle. Using on-camera interviews with friends and colleagues, and archival film and video clips, “Run for Your Life,” directed by Judd Ehrlich, is mainly an affectionate portrait of the man, whose every foible and virtue is noted with fond tolerance. The film, which is being released simultaneously on DVD and in a Manhattan theater, also offers a history of the marathon, from its beginnings as a sparsely attended four-lap race around Central Park through its apotheosis as a wellspring of civic pride and corporate sponsorship.Along the way, moments of glory are recalled — Alberto Salazar’s world record, Grete Waitz’s nine victories — along with a few episodes of ignominy, without which this would hardly be a New York story. I’m sure Lebow would have been just as glad to forget the name Rosie Ruiz, who traversed most of the course in a subway car in 1979, but viewers will probably be amused by the memory of the scandal she caused, or tickled to learn of it for the first time.The film’s words and images also create a time-lapse picture of New York’s renewal, a transformation that Lebow, without necessarily intending to, surely helped along.In the mid-’70s, when the marathon became a high-profile, five-borough event, the city was suffering from a crisis of order and morale that seems almost inconceivable now. In that context, sending thousands of people in shorts on a Sunday jog through the streets must have seemed marvelously mad. But now, with the specter of hard times before the city again, the race is a marvelously reassuring fact of life.",0,,,0

As its waterlogged treasure hunters brave fire and flood to find and bring back a cache of gold ingots from a sunken Nazi U-boat in the Black Sea, they grouse endlessly about paper-pushing rich guys who don’t know the meaning of real work. Robinson (Jude Law, somewhat miscast), the leader of the crew, is a former British Navy captain whose years at sea cost him his marriage to a woman he still dreams about. In the lulls between action sequences, Robinson has misty watercolor memories of his wife and young son before she left him to marry a wealthy man, another thorn in his side.Robinson’s bottled-up rage surfaces when he is suddenly relieved of his post-Navy job with an ocean salvage corporation and given a meager severance. All at once, this hard-working man’s man feels useless. In a bar with other unemployed workers, he fumes about having led a grueling life that has left him nothing to show for it. The scene establishes an ominous undertone of simmering class resentment that never eases up. Robinson seizes the opportunity to lead a speculative exploration for undersea gold based on a rumor and enlists a loutish crew of British and Russian seamen.Because “Black Sea,” directed by Kevin Macdonald (“The Last King of Scotland”) from a screenplay by Dennis Kelly, begins with pictures of Hitler and Stalin and a World War II montage, you prepare for a story that has some historical resonance. But once the treasure’s complicated provenance has been described, it is never mentioned again.Disguised as an old-fashioned adventure film, “Black Sea” is a really a jeremiad for the new gilded age. At the outset Robinson declares that everyone aboard will get an equal portion of the gold, which he estimates will yield each crew member $2 million. That doesn’t seem enough to some of the sailors, especially the Russians. Everyone realizes that the fewer men who survive the mission, the greater the individual reward. But since the vessel requires a crew of nine to operate, they can’t methodically kill one another off until only one is left standing — or can they? Edgy relations between the Britons and the Russians quickly deteriorate into a Cold War waged by Neanderthal tribes. Except for one bilingual go-between, none of these mercenaries can be described as civilized. Even Mr. Law’s Robinson is half-mad with greed and repeatedly risks all the men’s lives to keep the operation going when it faces seemingly insurmountable obstacles. As roughed up as he appears, Mr. Law isn’t really convincing as a crude, burly seaman with a chip on his shoulder. Robinson’s most sympathetic trait is his protective relationship with the crew’s youngest member, the 18-year-old Tobin (Bobby Schofield), who is bullied by older shipmates who wrongly assume him to be a virgin. The closest thing to a traditional villain is Daniels (Scoot McNairy), the duplicitous, smooth-talking assistant to the operation’s devious private funder (Tobias Menzies).“Black Sea” delivers on the action front, as the usual problems — mechanical failure, fire, explosion, leakage and sudden eruptions of violence — imperil the voyage. Yet these sequences, while carefully parceled out and adroitly staged, have limited visceral clout.The story loses credibility as it goes along, as the body count escalates, and Robinson’s solutions to life-and-death crises grow increasingly far-fetched. Well before it ends preposterously, “Black Sea” has taken leave of its senses. But one consistent element remains: the movie’s contempt and hatred for the rich.“Black Sea” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

269,2012-12-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:16,MANOHLA DARGIS,The Wretched Lift Their Voices,"In the first long act of “Les Misérables,” Anne Hathaway opens her mouth, and the agony, passion and violence that have decorously idled in the background of this all-singing, all-suffering pop opera pour out. It’s a gusher! She’s playing Fantine, the factory worker turned prostitute turned martyr, and singing the showstopping “I Dreamed a Dream,” her gaunt face splotched red and brown. The artful grunge layered onto the cast can be a distraction, as you imagine assistant dirt wranglers anxiously hovering off camera. Ms. Hathaway, though, holds you rapt with raw, trembling emotion. She devours the song, the scene, the movie, and turns her astonishing, cavernous mouth into a vision of the void.The director Tom Hooper can be a maddening busybody behind the camera, but this is one number in which he doesn’t try to upstage his performers. Maybe he was worried that Ms. Hathaway would wolf him down too. Whatever the case, he keeps it relatively simple. Moving the camera slightly with her — she lurches somewhat out of frame at one point, suggesting a violent, existential wrenching — he shoots the song in a head-and-shoulder close-up, with the background blurred. By that point, with her dignity and most of her pretty hair gone, Fantine has fallen as far as she can. She has become one of the abject castaways of the musical’s title, a wretched of the earth.Written by Alain Boublil and the composer Claude-Michel Schönberg (with English-language lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer), the musical “Les Misérables” is of course one really big show, perhaps the biggest and certainly one of the longest-running. Its Web site hints at its reach: Since the English-language version was first performed in London in 1985, it has been translated into 21 languages, performed in 43 countries, won almost 100 awards (Tony, Grammy) and been seen by more than 60 million people. In 1996 Hong Kong mourners sang “Do You Hear the People Sing” to memorialize Tiananmen Square. In 2009 the awkward duckling Susan Boyle became a swan and a world brand with her rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream” on the television show “Britain’s Got Talent.”Somewhere amid the grime, power ballads and surging strings there is also Victor Hugo, whose monumental 1862 humanistic novel, “Les Misérables,” was, along with the musical “Oliver!,” Mr. Boublil’s original inspiration. Like the show, Mr. Hooper’s movie opens in 1815 and closes shortly after the quashed June Rebellion of 1832, boiling the story down to a pair of intertwined relationships.The first pivots on the antagonism of a onetime prison guard, now inspector, Javert (Russell Crowe, strained) toward a former convict, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman, earnest); the second involves the love-at-first-sight swooning between Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and Marius (Eddie Redmayne), a revolutionary firebrand. As a child, Cosette was rescued by Valjean from her caretakers, the Thénardiers (the energetic Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, who nicely stir, and stink up, the air).Part of the tug of “Les Misérables” is that it recounts a familiar, reassuring story of oppression, liberation and redemption, complete with period costumes and tear-yanking songs. Georges Sand apparently felt that there was too much Christianity in Hugo’s novel; Mr. Hooper seems to have felt that there wasn’t enough in the musical and, using his camera like a Magic Marker, repeatedly underlines the religious themes that are already narratively and lyrically manifest. In the first number (“Look Down”), set against a digitally enhanced, visibly artificial port, Valjean helps haul an enormous ship into a dock. Dressed mainly in cardinal red, the prisoners pull on ropes, while singing during a lashing rain, with Javert glaring down at them. (And, yes, he will fall.)By the time the scene ends, Valjean hasn’t just been handed his release papers after 19 years as a prisoner, he has also become a Christ figure, hoisting a preposterously large wooden pole on to his shoulder. Mr. Hooper’s maximalist approach is evident the very moment the scene begins — the camera swooping, as waves and music crash — setting an overblown tone that rarely quiets. His work in this passage, from the roller-coaster moves of the cameras to the loud incidental noise that muffles the lyrics, undermines his actors and begins to push the musical from spectacle toward bloat. Mr. Jackman suffers the most from Mr. Hooper’s approach, as when Valjean paces up and down a hallway while delivering “What Have I Done,” a to-and-fro that witlessly, needlessly, literalizes the character’s internal struggle.Mr. Hooper’s decision to shoot the singing live, as opposed to having the singers lip-sync recorded songs, as has been customary in movie musicals since the 1930s, yields benefits. That’s especially the case with Ms. Hathaway, Mr. Redmayne and Daniel Huttlestone, a scene-stealer who plays the Thénardiers’ young son. (This isn’t the first contemporary musical to resurrect the practice of live singing, which was used for both “At Long Last Love,” directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and “The Commitments,” directed by Alan Parker.) It’s touching, watching performers like Ms. Hathaway and Mr. Redmayne giving it their all, complete with quavering chins and straining tendons. Mr. Redmayne, an appealing actor with a freckled face built for wonder, at times seems to be stretching his long body to hit his higher notes.Mr. Redmayne’s sincerity complements Ms. Seyfried’s old-fashioned trilling and her wide-eyed appearance, even if their romance lacks spark. Then again, so does the movie. Song after song, as relationships and rebellion bloom, you wait in vain for the movie to, as well, and for the filmmaking to rise to the occasion of both its source material and its hard-working performers.As he showed in “The King’s Speech” and in the television series “John Adams,” Mr. Hooper can be very good with actors. But his inability to leave any lily ungilded — to direct a scene without tilting or hurtling or throwing the camera around — is bludgeoning and deadly. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat.“Les Misérables” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

His heroes are titans like Lee Clow, Dan Wieden, Hal Riney and George Lois, highly successful businessmen who affect a well-heeled bohemianism  their style would eventually be watered down into casual Fridays  and who don’t always work in New York. Surfing is a recurring theme.The film consists mostly of these men (and a few women, including the formidable Mary Wells) talking about how they work, which is nearly always interesting, albeit in a minor way that might not justify the price of a theater ticket if you don’t already have an interest in the topic. Mr. Pray, whose previous documentaries include “Scratch,” about hip-hop D.J.’s, and “Surfwise,” tries to whip up some intellectual meringue with an extended metaphor involving ancient stone carvings and communications satellites that’s best ignored. We don’t need him to prove that advertising matters and that its best examples can be taken seriously as art.It would be nice, though, if he pushed his subjects a little harder when they say  as several do  that they had to fight to convince their clients and peers that the best advertising is based on big, simple ideas and powerful emotions. Are they alarmed that their approach has permeated the culture, from art to journalism to politics? No one seems to be. In their hands, after all, those techniques were stunningly successful, from Mr. Clow’s “1984” Super Bowl spot for Apple to Mr. Riney’s “morning in America” re-election ads for Ronald Reagan.The foulmouthed Mr. Lois (Tommy Hilfiger, “I Want My MTV”) is the film’s funniest and most endearing character. But the single biggest surprise, for those of us who haven’t heard the story before, is Mr. Wieden’s acknowledgment of the inspiration for his “Just Do It” Nike slogan: “Let’s do it,” Gary Gilmore’s last words before he was executed by a firing squad. Think about that the next time you drop $100 on a pair of retro Air Jordans.ART & COPYOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Doug Pray; original concept by Gregory Beauchamp and Kirk Souder; director of photography, Peter Nelson; edited by Philip Owens; music by Jeff Martin; produced by Jimmy Greenway and Michael Nadeau; released by Seventh Art Releasing.

Though her beloved husband, a successful violinist, is now deceased, she is consoled by the filmmaker’s strong resemblance to the grandfather whose name he bears and whose unpublished compositions connect her, and the film, to the past.Exploiting this resemblance, Mr. Kaabour shyly takes on the dual role of grandson and grandfather as he prepares for his wedding and, with some panic, comes to grips with the reality of his grandmother’s eventual death.Warmhearted and defiantly unsentimental, “Grandma, a Thousand Times” gains lightness from Teta’s tart observations — “She’s old, isn’t she?” she whispers to the camera after meeting Mr. Kaabour’s glowing blond fiancée — and the director’s stylistic sprightliness. Working with the Lebanese cinematographer Muriel Aboulrouss, he flash-freezes a resilient, no-nonsense personality that holds his family together. Whether haggling with vendors in the street below or haranguing the butcher with her phoned-in meat order, Teta commands the respect of her section of old Beirut. She may spend much of her day sucking on a hookah, but it hasn’t dulled her vocal cords.“I don’t want to make any more movies!” she protests at the end. You hope her grandson doesn’t feel the same way.GRANDMA, A THOUSAND TIMESOpened on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Mahmoud Kaabour; director of photography, Muriel Aboulrouss; edited by Patricia Hneine; music by Nabil Amarshi; produced by Eva Star Sayre; released by Veritas Films, Doha Film Institute, TriBeCa Enterprises and Paladin.

This is not the fantasy rape that used to be popular in bodice-ripping novels, where a dashing, strong-willed man forces himself on a maiden who actually pines for him. It’s a violent, terrifying attack, and the director, Fouad Mikati, portrays it vividly.So it is eerie when Miranda, after her rapist (Shiloh Fernandez) is convicted and sentenced, begins visiting him in prison. Ms. Pike keeps you guessing as to whether Miranda is actually interested in rehabilitating and perhaps becoming involved with him, or is just baiting a trap for him once he is released. Mr. Fernandez, too, has to invest his character, William, with two possibilities. He might be repentant, or he might just be the same old brute with an improved ability to disguise himself.The stakes become higher when William gets out of prison. Nick Nolte does nice work as Miranda’s father, who is drawn into the evolving cat-and-mouse game.Having carefully built tension, the movie, written by Patricia Beauchamp and Joe Gossett, doesn’t seem to know what to do with it. The film ends on a note that is supposed to be disquieting but registers more as: “What? Is it over?”",0,,,1

In Mr. Refn’s conception of this milieu, apartments for models don’t exist, and so the fresh-faced, extremely underage aspiring model Jesse (the doe-eyed Elle Fanning) has to shack up in a sleazy Pasadena motel overseen by a shady Keanu Reeves, playing against virtuous type.Jesse’s beauty and freshness are the envy of other models, who feel washed up as they hit their early 20s. Her allure also awes a gallery of other affected and pretentious people, or rather, thin simulations of affected and pretentious people. Thin simulation is as close to characterization as Mr. Refn can get here. Jesse is an appealing innocent, but after her encounter with the film’s title object (no, really), she changes, hardens. You can tell by the way she swivels her high-heeled foot after a fashion show.The movie’s narrative, such as it is, includes intimations of vampirism, sexual frustration culminating in necrophilia, and more unpleasant stuff. Mr. Refn composes striking images, but they’re all secondhand: faux Fellini, faux David Lynch and so on. (Cliff Martinez’s electronic score is also pastiche-like, but a far wittier concoction over all.)Mr. Refn’s early movies (1996’s “Pusher,” 1999’s “Bleeder”) showed him to be a gifted if willfully outré genre director. But in recent years, and especially in this film, his work looks like that of a technically adept, emotionally stunted adolescent who’s not nearly as bright as he thinks he is, and who is desperate to elicit the concern of his parents. “The Neon Demon” is hot garbage that dares you to call it offensive. In addition, it’s offensive.GLENN KENNY“The Neon Demon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying adult guardian or parent) for violence, nudity, cussing, sexuality, moral turpitude and other prominent features of hot garbage.",0,,1333124.0,1
274,2011-02-18,The Last Lions,Jeremy Irons,"USA, Botswana",Dereck Joubert,"Documentary, Family",English,69.0,88.0,Dereck Joubert,2011,8.3,3736.0,87.0,2017-11-02 04:18:12,MANOHLA DARGIS,Tooth-and-Claw Life of a Dedicated Single Mother,"One of the most urgent and certainly among the most beautifully shot documentaries to hit the big screen in recent memory, “The Last Lions” isn’t just another cute and fuzzy encounter session with a different species. It’s a pulse-quickening, tear-duct milking and outrageously dramatized story about the threats — wildfires, chomping teeth, stampeding hooves and, worst of all, unseen humans — that face a female lion trying to protect her cubs. Here, single motherhood doesn’t mean juggling family, work and PTA meetings: it means parking the tots in the bushes and then trying to take down a water buffalo the size of a jeep.Alas, the movie’s title is horrifyingly accurate. Conservation groups tend to put the current population of African lions at roughly between 20,000 and 50,000, a staggering decline from the estimated 400,000 that were born and roamed free a half-century ago.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global network of environmental groups, has classified lions as vulnerable and indicates that their numbers are only declining. Their future looks grim, even hopeless. (In Kenya, home to Elsa of the popular 1966 movie “Born Free,” wild lions might be wiped out within one to two decades.)  All this makes a well-intentioned movie like “The Last Lions,” from the husband and wife filmmaking team Dereck and Beverly Joubert, necessary viewing.It’s perhaps because the stakes are so high for lions — and also maybe because, Al Gore notwithstanding, environmental bad news is as hard a sell at the movies as it is off screen — that the Jouberts decided to personalize this story of survival. Steering clear of the customary talking heads and dire statistics, which might chance audience indifference, they have instead created an empathetic, heart-heavy story about the burdens of parenthood, and hired Jeremy Irons — the voice of the villain in the Disney animation “The Lion King” — to narrate. In other words, they went the route of “March of the Penguins,” the improbable hit about emperor  penguins toughing it out in Antarctica that was reassuringly narrated by Morgan Freeman.It soon becomes eyeball-poppingly obvious, though, that the fairly peaceable kingdom of emperor penguins is worlds apart from the tooth-and-claw lives of lions. Forget the ice capades of those tuxedoed,  natural-born comedians. Here, in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, just north of South Africa, carnivores battle one another in a drama far wilder and bloodier than any that Marlin Perkins delivered on television on “Wild Kingdom.” Within the first 20 minutes of “The Last Lions” one adult lion dies in a ferocious on-screen fight, a battle capped with a shot of flies buzzing on a destroyed eye, and another becomes an  off-screen snack for a crocodile. As television fodder like “When Animals Attack!” proves, death piques human interest in animals as much as “aww” images of playful kittens do.The central lion in the movie, called Ma di Tau (“mother of lions” in Setswana,  a language of Botswana), certainly has an arresting, hard-luck story. First, her old man splits, and then she and her three little ones lose their home in a fire.  With nowhere nearby to run to — the nasty people, I mean pride, next door limit her options — she and her cubs move into a marsh surrounded by crocodiles. Hard-wired territorial demands and fast-encroaching humans might be why the family has to move into such a bad neighborhood. But from the absurdly personalized narration purred by Mr. Irons — he describes how the story’s beleaguered heroine feels and what she knows — the relocation is just another episode in “As the Lions Turn.”It’s one thing to feel compassion for animals and to believe that they have emotions. At certain instances, rather entertainingly, Ma di Tau even seems to be remembering, via a series of flashbacks, moments out of her past. Yet turning animals into humanlike characters denies them their nature and, here at least, also makes for some deeply unpleasant and exploitative interludes. There’s a needlessly protracted sequence between the mother and a wounded cub that’s pure filmmaker sadism and that, in its cutting and framing, makes it seem as if the mother is consciously cruel rather than following her instincts. These techniques, along with the overwrought, heavily editorializing music, help build great narrative tension out of what often looks like separate documented moments in time. You might cry, but you also feel beaten up.“The Last Lions” is a worthy, intensive labor of love that took years to shoot and edit, and it’s also more gripping than a lot of recent Hollywood thrillers. Commendably, the Jouberts and National Geographic (its movie division is distributing the documentary) have also established the Big Cats Initiative, an international conservation project to spread the word about endangered cats. Yet by sensationalizing and sentimentalizing a tale of animal life and death, by focusing on one lion family instead of the threats faced by a species, the Jouberts have risked reducing a real catastrophe into a tidy fiction. Then again, is the fault really theirs or of those who pay attention only when a tragedy looks like something they can relate to?“The Last Lions” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The film contains some graphic and intense animal fights and an extended scene with a wounded cub that might be very difficult for sensitive viewers.THE LAST LIONSOpens on Friday  in New York, Los Angeles and Washington.Written and directed by Dereck Joubert; narrated by Jeremy Irons; director of photography, Mr. Joubert; edited by Susan Scott; music by  Alex Wurman; produced by Dereck and Beverly Joubert, Lisa Truitt and  Chris Miller; released by National Geographic Entertainment.

Mayer-like boss insists straight-faced that “the writer is king!” It’s a cruel joke, one that the Coens play out as Barton is engulfed in flames and madness. As apocalyptic as a Nathanael West hallucination, “Barton Fink” felt like the testament of two filmmakers who, however much they loved movies, were happy to torch the industry. Yet here they are in “Hail, Caesar!,” back on the lot and cracking jokes.If this were anyone other than the Coens you might think that success and a couple of Oscars had mellowed them. Not likely. “Hail, Caesar!” is one of those diversions that they turn out in between masterworks and duds. It’s a typically sly, off-center comedy, once again set against the machinery of the motion-picture business. And, as usual with the Coens, it has more going on than there might seem, including in its wrangling over God and ideology, art and entertainment. Some of it is familiar and satisfyingly funny, even if there are laughs and bits that seem as if they were written to amuse only the Coens and the Turner Classic Movies crowd. (Love the Loretta Young nod!)As the Coens have done in the past, they use an unseen narrator (Michael Gambon), who gives the movie a slight fairy-tale vibe, announcing that we’re not in Kansas or anywhere like life. Instead it’s once upon a time in Tinseltown in the 1950s, the decade after Barton Fink’s meltdown. The studio is again Capitol, but here the focus is a suit, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a front-office true believer and a devout Roman Catholic. As tightly wound as the watch he regularly checks, Mannix makes problems disappear before they become headaches or scandal-sheet headlines. He’s a pit bull in a fedora, but his loyalty to the studio suggests that he’s either an idealist or a fanatic. So what is he?He’s playing a role, for starters, much like the stable of stars and extras under his wing. Like some other Coen creations, he shares a name with a real person, Eddie Mannix, a behind-the-scenes fixer who worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when it claimed to have more stars than there are in heaven. From the mid-1920s on, Mannix prowled that studio, serving as Louis B. Mayer’s trusted aide and the studio’s go-between with the unions; he even greenlighted films. He pops up dealing and scheming in some of the sleazier, less reliable Hollywood histories, but in “Hail, Caesar!” he’s a straight arrow and effectively an executive suite of one — the only big shot on the lot.The Coens like to open their movies with a question mark — the spurious truth claims in “Fargo,” the tumbling tumbleweeds in “The Big Lebowski,” the Old World shtetl in “A Serious Man” — which suits their playfully layered, sideways storytelling. (They’re masters of the narrative tease.) Both blunt and opaque, the first image in “Hail, Caesar!” is of a large crucifix in a church where Mannix, clutching a rosary, is bowed in prayer and soon making the first of his confession-box appearances. Grimacing, he comes across as a man with far more on his mind than spiritual matters; Mr. Brolin’s large, magnificently sculptural head has rarely looked heavier.In their circuitous way, the Coens get around to sketching in a story with the kidnapping of a major Capitol star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), who’s nearing the end of production on one of its big prestige pictures. Also titled “Hail, Caesar!,” it looks and sounds like one of those dopily sincere religious spectacles that the studios never tire of. (In a Coen-esque flourish, it appears at least partly modeled on the 1959 epic “Ben-Hur,” in which a lock-jawed Charlton Heston, a few years after parting the Red Sea, plays a Jewish prince turned Roman slave turned charioteer who has a life-changing encounter with Jesus.) Whitlock’s kidnapping stirs up turmoil and mystery — the snatchers portentously call themselves “the Future” — which leads to Mannix playing shamus as he tries to get back his star.At first, the kidnapping seems like an excuse for the Coens to fool around with genre and, as they like to do, riff on classical Hollywood form and style. Usefully, the kidnapping gets Mannix out of his office and onto the set, including a soundstage where a song-and-dance man in a sailor suit, Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), makes like a randy Gene Kelly. Mr. Tatum’s number is delightful, at once satirical and virtuosic, although the winking bawdiness of the choreography is more risqué than what would have been allowed in a real 1950s musical. Here, as elsewhere, the Coens are scratching off the glossy studio veneer to show what lies beneath, including unspoken desires, even as they’re also putting on the kind of good show that helped build MGM.In its shape, “Hail, Caesar!” at times brings to mind one of those old plot-free film revues that featured a grab bag of studio talent performing in strung-together musical, comic and dramatic scenes. Among the other marquee names Mannix handles are DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an aquatic star who enters with a snarl and an Esther Williams splash, and a singing cowboy, Hobie Doyle (a charming Alden Ehrenreich), who goes from trick riding to wearing a tuxedo amid a froth of satiny gowns and Mid-Atlantic accents. It’s a rough transition, especially for Hobie’s director, Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes, perfection), who tries to squeeze the drawl out of the cowboy in an elocution lesson that makes for a very funny duet and illustrates Hollywood magic at its dissembling best.The clock may be ticking for Whitlock, but the Coens are not in any great rush to see him rescued. They’re more interested in meandering in and around their dream factory, in showing DeeAnna wiggling underwater in a mermaid costume and Hobie doing a headstand in a saddle. Like all the performers at Capitol, these two prove supremely good at their jobs, which feels almost sentimental for the Coens but is also an acknowledgment of the old film factory’s brilliance. Even Whitlock, a high-wattage dim bulb, delivers the goods, as does Mr. Clooney, who paints the purloined actor in 50 shades of smiling idiocy. Whitlock is a boob; he’s also a great Hollywood star.No one, though, is more competent than Mannix, who in his looks, loyalty and especially his piety is finally the biggest fantasy figure on screen: the studio executive as a man of virtue. For all his church prayers, Mannix’s faith is invested in Capitol. He’s an embodiment of the industry’s self-delusion and self-mythology, the kind of executive who invokes vision and bullies the help. In this, he makes a sly contrast with some Communist screenwriters who are true believers of a different stripe. Their discussions about art and dialectics mirror a side-splitter of a scene in which Mannix consults with four religious leaders about the studio’s depiction of Jesus. As it turns out, everyone has something to peddle — a talent, an angle, a god — and, truly, that’s entertainment.“Hail, Caesar!” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Photography had already captured moments that might have eluded the eye. The movies enabled visual artists to freeze blocks of time and analyze them at varying speeds. In consciously anatomizing motion and adopting multiple perspectives, the documentary implies, the Cubists may even have been trying to co-opt the brash new art form.“Picasso and Braque Go to the Movies” is filled with celebrated talking heads, including Martin Scorsese, who produced the film with Mr. Glimcher and Robert Greenhut;   artists like Julian Schnabel, Chuck Close, Eric Fischl and Lucas Samaras;  and the video performance artist Robert Whitman (the most articulate), discussing the relationship of movies to the artists’ work. Much of the documentary is a jumble of people extemporizing about this and that, but there is no connective overview.What holds the film together, more or less, is the steady stream of mostly slapstick clips from early cinema  especially Georges Méliès’ photographic magic tricks  whose playful spirit found its way into Cubist paintings and drawings, especially those of Picasso. A voracious consumer of  popular culture, he was first exposed to the movies in 1896, at 15, and was immediately smitten. Later Picasso became an ardent fan of Charlie Chaplin; he and the more cerebral Braque even founded a film club. Their passionate interest in new technologies extended to aviation, and they nicknamed each other Orville and Wilbur.In 1900 Picasso attended the World’s Fair in Paris, where he was captivated by the American dancer Loie Fuller, who wore billowing veils onto which colored light was projected. Those images, noted the art historian Bernice Rose, found their way into his seminal 1907 painting, “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon.” There is also speculation that the images of fans and musical instruments in Cubist paintings were borrowed from the movies. The more minutely the film analyzes Picasso’s paintings, the further it drifts from its subject.“Picasso and Braque Go to the Movies” proceeds from the assumption that changing technology drives artistic innovation. In the language of Mr. Scorsese, a vociferous champion of cinema as a serious art form: “Cubism was not a style,” he said. “It was a revolution that instigated a profoundly radical change of form  in fact a radical change of vision itself.” In his eyes, movies were the engine behind that revolution.PICASSO AND BRAQUE GO TO THE MOVIESOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Arne Glimcher; narrated by Martin Scorsese; director of photography, Petr Hlinomaz; edited by Sabine Krayenbühl; produced by Mr. Glimcher, Mr. Scorsese and Robert Greenhut; released by Arthouse Films.

Mr. Wells and his animators have come up with some impressive Martian landscapes, both on and beneath the surface, but, as usual, fluid motion and depth of field are trumped by waxy, inexpressive faces. Why hire Joan Cusack to play the mom if you’re just going to make her look like a mummy?The story, based on a children’s book by the cartoonist Berkeley Breathed, involves a race of stern Martian women who subjugate their men and kidnap Earth mothers because of their superior child-rearing skills. It could be read as antifeminist, if you had a term paper to write; parents may be more disturbed by the implication that an obedient child is more likely to have his mom taken by Martians.The film has a few witty visual jokes and a few surprisingly adult lines.

J. Cimfel and David K. White, work efficiently if unimaginatively to place the recently bereaved Anna (Beth Riesgraf) at the mercy of three would-be burglars. Suspecting hidden cash and an absent owner, these opportunistic goons arrive with quarreling machismo and without much of a plan. This they will regret as Anna, a quavering agoraphobic who has spent the previous decade indoors, has been far from idle.While the audience debates which is less appealing, Rob Senska’s photography or the characters’ morals, the actors (including Rory Culkin as a hapless fifth wheel) grit their teeth against a plot bristling with pain and payback. The house joins in, reconfiguring itself at Anna’s commands into a shape-shifting torture chamber.

Now commissioner of the Hong Kong police, Sean Lau (Aaron Kwok), to rescue his kidnapped wife, must free Joe Lee (Eddie Peng), the imprisoned son of Lau’s former rival for the commissionership (Tony Leung Ka Fai). After the handoff is botched, Chow Yun-Fat, in what the credits call a “special appearance,” plays a legislator who is on the committee that investigates the incident.But the machinations are just a pretext for such sequences as an escape in a crowded transit station and pursuits involving multiple teams of cars. The location work may have you pondering a Hong Kong vacation, which could be the goal. The movie refers to the city as the safest in Asia and touts its status as a financial capital, even as the portrait of corruption — with absurd power plays that involve characters predicting moves many steps in advance — makes it seem like a dicey place to park cash. Whatever it does for tourism, “Cold War 2” helps affirm Hong Kong’s film industry as a sturdy action factory.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,"Awwwwww, Ewwww, Who’s a Good Baby?","The French globe-trotting documentarian Thomas Balmès has taken up a delicate and treacherous assignment in his new film. Fanning out around the world — to the plains of Mongolia, the dusty grasslands of Namibia, the high rises of Tokyo and the streets of San Francisco — Mr. Balmès and his crew set out, about three years ago, to probe a network of mysterious creatures who speak a common idiom barely comprehensible to the rest of us. The film’s subjects are hard to understand and nearly impossible to resist. They project weakness and innocence, yet they also possess almost terrifying powers. And they are just so gosh-darn cute!Frankly, it’s hard to know just what to say about “Babies,” which episodically chronicles the first year in the lives of four far-flung infants. “Awwwwww” would be a start and will no doubt be the sound you hear most frequently from the patrons around you, along with an occasional “ewwww,” a stray gasp of concern or disapproval — you know how anxious and judgmental parents can be — and intermittent laughter. If you have read any child-rearing manuals (or just stared guiltily at a bedside stack of them while dragging yourself toward the squalling bundle of wee-hours need in the next room), “Babies” may be both a puzzle and a relief.It offers no advice or analysis, no talking-head rumination or voice-over explanation. The occasional snippets of grown-up dialogue are not accompanied by subtitles, which would be superfluous in any case. (But wouldn’t you love to know how to coo “who’s a good baby?” in Mongolian?) “Babies” is exactly what its title promises. It’s babies. And if you love babies you will find it very hard not to love “Babies.”Is it that simple? I mean, who doesn’t love babies? Why isn’t this just a smattering of YouTube videos (“Baby Pulls Cat’s Tail,” “Baby Eats Banana,” etc.) stitched together into a feature film and accompanied by a peppy musical score? That’s kind of what it is, but the utter accessibility of the movie — even babies will enjoy watching “Babies”! — results as much from Mr. Balmès’s canny formal intelligence as from the intrinsic adorability of his subjects.Which is not to be denied. Their names are Hattie, Mari, Bayarjargal and Ponijao, and they show themselves to be natural-born comedians, single-minded researchers, action heroes and disciplined workers, each in his or her own special way. They seem to possess distinctive personalities from the very beginning, and as they make their way through infancy, you watch their temperaments grow from bud to blossom.You also note that while parental love transcends differences of geography and tradition, various cultures cultivate their fledgling members in different ways. Bayarjargal, in Mongolia, is first tightly swaddled and then, as his mobility increases, tethered to his yurt by a long cloth cord. Ponijao, in Africa, crawls about surrounded by a group of women, and her play mimics their daily tasks of grinding meal and preparing food.In the metropolises of the developed world, Mari (in Japan) and Hattie (in California) are part of a structured world of work and leisure, surrounded by cellphones and computers and exposed to organized group activities that in some cases self-consciously try to mimic the rituals of agrarian and tribal societies.In the one scene that can be taken as infantile satire, Hattie, at a music class featuring songs of praise to “the earth, our mother,” stands up and makes for the exit, as if fed up with the New Age mumbo-jumbo to which she has been subjected. Another brilliantly funny sequence cuts between Mari’s frustration as she tries to thread a wooden spindle onto a disc with a hole in it and Bayarjargal’s patient wrangling of a roll of toilet paper, which he bites into once it has arrived in his grasp. There is something profound and poignant in these struggles, which illustrate one of the fundamental tasks of babyhood: the mastery of the physical environment.Other challenges confront these intrepid young travelers on what a philosopher once called the long forced march toward humanity: the aggression (and affection) of siblings and peers; the ways of other animals (cats in particular); the recognition and communication of basic emotions. And though they do their share of crying — they are babies, after all — Hattie, Ponijao, Bayarjargal and Mari all demonstrate remarkable stoicism in the face of a complicated universe. And the ultimate lesson of “Babies,” at least for non- (which is of course to say ex-) babies, is that being small, helpless and brand new is hard.But hardly impossible. They grow, they learn, and they remind the rest of us of the astonishing power that is our common birthright. We are cast into the world as a bundle of reflexes, unable to focus our eyes, control our limbs or influence our environment in any way. Twelve months later we can walk, kiss, utter basic words and comprehend complicated utterances. It may be downhill from there: a movie called “Adolescents” or, heaven knows, “Grownups,” would hardly be as charming as “Babies.” But “Babies” just might restore your faith in our perplexing, peculiar and stubbornly lovable species.“Babies” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested).

281,2011-03-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:13,MANOHLA DARGIS,"A Woman With a Son, but Not a Country","Ripped from the headlines or a pool of similarly themed movies, the fiction film “Illegal” traces the ups and increasing downs of an immigrant’s struggles to stay in her adopted land. At once high-minded, sincere and frustrating, it opens with its central character, a Russian immigrant, Tania (Anne Coesens), reading a letter denying her residency in Belgium. Facing immediate deportation with her young son, Ivan (Alexandre Gontcharov), Tania reacts with the rash desperation that characterizes many of her subsequent actions: she takes an iron and begins burning her fingertips, obliterating one proof of her identity.What’s in a name? That question and others of nation and citizenry are the issues that swirl promisingly through this movie, only to be drowned in a mother’s tears.When the story picks up again, Tania has physically healed, is working for a cleaning company and is still in Belgium. There are difficulties: she pays her rent to Nowak (Tomasz Bialkowski), a member of the mob with an unsettling smile. Mostly, though, life seems good, what with her adoring child, job, apartment and at least one friend, Zina (Olga Zhdanova), all of which instantly disappear when Tania is detained by a couple of immigration cops. Taken to a detention center, she becomes a person without a country, caught in a harsh, in-between world.Much of “Illegal” unfolds in that liminal space, a facility where a near-United Nations of men, women and children wait for asylum or deportation. It’s a grim place, with solemn detainees trying to maintain hope in between small and large indignities, the occasional food fight and official beatings. As Tania works the angles, she pleads her case with a lawyer, refuses to give her name (the authorities refer to her by a prison number) and tries to keep tabs on Ivan, as she holds Nowak at bay. As weeks turn into months, the narrative shifts into idle, jolted to life with spasms of violence — an escape attempt, a beating, screams. In a largely reactive role, Ms. Coesens, a sympathetic presence, keeps you engaged if never enthralled.The film’s writer and director, Olivier Masset-Depasse, does his hardest to pull you close to Tania, largely with hand-held, intimate camerawork. For much of the movie, the camera hovers near Tania, if not as close as those in the fictions of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the Belgian filmmaking brothers whose work surely influenced “Illegal.” What is missing here is a comparable aesthetic and moral clarity. Mr. Masset-Depasse shoots Tania burning her fingers, for instance, as if he and the cameraman were hiding in the next room, peering from behind curtains. He might be trying to suggest that all of us (he and we) are part of the surveillance apparatus that captures Tania, but it just looks as if she had a peeping Tom in the house.One problem is that while Mr. Masset-Depasse frames Tania’s status in vague political terms, he doesn’t make an argument. Instead he creates heroes and villains in what is, by turns, a prison flick, a psychological thriller and a maternal melodrama. When the cops grab Tania, you know they’re awful because they separate her from Ivan. They embody power, yet it’s unclear what that power wants except to kick everyone out. That isn’t an argument; it’s a blunt turn of the dramatic screw.And when Tania’s Chilean roommate says that her grandfather was a slave, her father was a victim of Augusto Pinochet, and now “it’s my turn,” the litany is meant to prick your conscience. Instead it smacks of a filmmaker’s grandstanding in a sad movie that makes you feel bad, partly because it gives so little room to thought.IllegalOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Olivier Masset-Depasse; director of photography, Tommaso Fiorilli; edited by Damien Keyeux; music by Lingo: André Dziezuk and Marc Mergen; scenery by Patrick Dechesne and Alain-Pascal Housiaux; costumes by Magdalena Labuz; produced by Jacques-Henri and Olivier Bronckart; released by Film Movement.

SCOTT,"Buy, Buy, Buy, to Keep Up With the You-Know-Whos","As glossy and golden-tinged as a magazine advertisement spread, “The Joneses” proposes itself, at least at first, as a satire of modern consumerism. Members of the titular family, a foursome with perfect teeth, lithe bodies and limitless sex appeal, don’t just embody a sleek and seamless ideal of material comfort and aesthetic perfection. They also sell that ideal, with an aggression that is no less ruthless for being invisible.The Joneses  Demi Moore and David Duchovny are the mom and dad, Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth their winsome teenage children  are not a family at all, but rather a team of marketers dispatched to a wealthy subdivision to seduce the natives into buying more stuff. The Joneses are employees of a mysterious company (their supervisor is mischievously played by Lauren Hutton), and their productivity is measured by their success in inducing the neighbors to keep up with them. The more golf clubs, track suits, cellphones and high-end prepared dinners that are sold, the happier the Joneses’  bosses seem to be.But this pursuit of happiness runs into complications, most of them brought about by the intrusion of real emotions into a scene of smooth fakery. Steve, the father, has the hots for his fake wife; their bogus daughter has a thing for older men; and Mick, her brother, encounters some social confusion on his way to a full-blown identity crisis. Meanwhile the envy of the guy next door (an excellent Gary Cole) slithers from ridiculousness to tragedy.And “The Joneses,” written and directed by Derrick Borte, unravels a tight, understated satiric premise into a soft and sentimental drama. After the Joneses’ imposture is revealed to the audience, which is almost immediately, Mr. Borte steps back to let Ms. Moore, icy and serene, and Mr. Duchovny, a master of genial smugness, stretch out and explore their surroundings and the facets of their characters.While this happens, the movie sends out porcupine quills of social criticism, finding the soft underbelly of the debt-driven, compulsive materialism that is a pervasive aspect of American life. Suavely updating the iconography of suburban emptiness and avoiding overstatement, Mr. Borte conjures up a pleasant Stepford that runs less on robotic conformity than on endless, anxious competition. The key to the film is that it allows this life to have some real appeal.The Joneses are good looking, and so is “The Joneses.” But the stiletto it should be concealing seems to have gotten lost on the way to the third act, when the sharp humor turns into a dull, blunt drama that lets everyone off the hook. As the shills reveal their souls, the movie turns into an exercise in the very phoniness it initially set out to expose. And since you’ve already paid for the ticket, you might end up feeling cheated.“The Joneses” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Now Prepare to Fall.,"In “The Revenant,” a period drama reaching for tragedy, Leonardo DiCaprio plays the mountain man Hugh Glass, a figure straight out of American myth and history. He enters dressed in a greasy, fur-trimmed coat, holding a flintlock rifle while stealing through a forest primeval that Longfellow might have recognized. This, though, is no Arcadia; it’s 1823 in the Great Plains, a pitiless testing ground for men that’s littered with the vivid red carcasses of skinned animals, ghastly portents of another slaughter shortly to come. The setting could not be more striking or the men more flinty.“The Revenant” is an American foundation story, by turns soaring and overblown. Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (“Birdman,” “Babel”), it features a battalion of very fine, hardworking actors, none more diligently committed than Mr. DiCaprio, and some of the most beautiful natural tableaus you’re likely to see in a movie this year. Partly shot in outwardly unspoiled tracts in Canada and Argentina, it has the brilliant, crystalline look that high-definition digital can provide, with natural vistas that seem to go on forever and suggest the seeming limitless bounty that once was. Here, green lichen carpets trees that look tall enough to pierce the heavens. It’s that kind of movie, with that kind of visual splendor — it spurs you to match its industrious poeticism.If you’re familiar with Mr. Iñárritu’s work, you know paradise is generally short-lived, and here arrows and bullets are soon flying, bodies are falling and the muddy banks of a riverside camp are a gory churn. Glass, part of a commercial fur expedition, escapes with others on a boat and sails into an adventure that takes him through a crucible of suffering — including a near-fatal grizzly attack — that evokes by turns classics of American literature and a “Perils of Pauline”-style silent-film serial. Left for dead by two companions, Glass crawls out of a shallow grave and toward the men who abandoned him. It’s a narrative turn that suggests he, like so many before him, is one of D. H. Lawrence’s essential American souls: “hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.”The movie is partly based on “The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge,” a 2002 historical adventure by Michael Punke inspired by the real Hugh Glass. In 1823, Glass signed on with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company for an expedition on the upper Missouri River that almost did him in when Arikara Indians attacked the group and, sometime later, he was mauled by a grizzly sow that may have been protecting her cubs. The bear should have killed Glass. Instead, its failure to do so — along with Glass’s frontier skills, some help from strangers and the indestructible romance of the American West — turned him into a mountain man legend and the inspiration for various accounts, including a book-length poem and a 1971 film, “Man in the Wilderness.”The historical Glass was somewhat of a question mark, which makes him a spacious vessel for interpretation. Mr. Iñárritu, who wrote the script with Mark L. Smith, fills that vessel to near overflowing, specifically by amplifying Glass with a vague, gauzily romantic past life with an unnamed Pawnee wife (Grace Dove) seen in elliptical flashback. By the time the movie opens, the wife is long dead, having been murdered by white troops, and Glass’s son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), has become his close companion. The son’s name evokes James Fenimore Cooper’s Hawk-eye (“The Last of the Mohicans”), and together Glass and Hawk create an intimate, familial bulwark — and a multicultural father-and-son dyad — in a wilderness teeming with assorted savages.Who exactly the savage is here is never much of an issue; as a sign scrawled in French spells out in one scene, everyone is. Mr. Iñárritu likes big themes, but he isn’t given to subtlety. There’s a shocker of an image, for instance, in “Amores Perros,” his feature debut, which expresses his talent for finding the indelible cinematic shot, the one you can’t look away from even when you want to, and also underscores his penchant for overstatement. One of those multi-stranded stories that he helped repopularize (“Babel,” etc.), “Amores Perros” includes a murder capped by the vision of human blood spilled on a hot griddle. This being a big moment as well as an illustration of Mr. Iñárritu’s sensibility, the blood doesn’t just splatter, it also sizzles. It’s filmmaking as swagger.I thought of that artfully boiling blood while watching “The Revenant,” with its butchered animals, muddled ideas, heart-skippingly natural landscapes and moment after moment of visual and narrative sizzle. What makes too many of his moments, ghastly and grand — an arrow piercing a man’s throat, the beatific face of a beloved, a man scooping the innards out of a fallen horse, the enveloping softness of the dusk light — isn’t the moment itself, but that little something special that he adds to it, whether it’s a gurgle of blood in a throat or the perfectly lighted sheen of a hunk of offal. Mr. Iñárritu isn’t content to merely seduce you with ecstatic beauty and annihilating terror; he wants to blow your mind, to amp up your art-house experience with blockbusterlike awesomeness.Sometimes, as with “Birdman,” Mr. Iñárritu’s last movie, this desire to knock the audience out pays off. “The Revenant” is a more explicitly serious, graver and aspirational effort. Working again with a team that includes the director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki (whose credits include “Birdman”) and a handful of special-effects companies, Mr. Iñárritu creates a lush, immersive world that suggests what early-19th-century North America might have looked like once upon an antediluvian time. Yet he complicates the myth of the American Eden — and with it the myth of exceptionalism — by giving Glass an Indian wife and mixed-race son. It’s a strategic move (and another bit of sizzle) that turns a loner into a sympathetic family man. It also softens the story. Instead of another hunter for hire doing his bit to advance the economy one pelt at a time, Glass becomes a sentimentalized figure and finally as much victim as victimizer.From Davy Crockett to Kit Carson, the mountain man has long had a hold on the American imagination and recently made a revisionist appearance in the form of Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of “The Hunger Games.” The mountain men in “The Revenant” are drawn along more traditional and masculine lines, from their bushy beards to the buckskins and bulky furs that at times make them look almost indistinguishable from the animals they kill. Mr. Iñárritu is entranced by this world, with its glories and miseries, its bison tartare and everyday primitivism, which he scrupulously recreates with detail and sweep. He’s particularly strong whenever Glass, employing that old can-do pragmatism, goes into survivalist mode to cauterize a wound, catch a fish or find shelter.But Mr. Iñárritu blows it when he moves from the material to the mystical and tries to elevate an ugly story into a spiritual one, with repeated images of a spiral and even a flash of homespun magical realism. Worse, he makes Glass not just a helpless witness to a murder that’s a stand-in for the genocide of the Indians, but also a proxy victim of that catastrophe. It’s disappointing in a movie that offers much and that actually points to another foundation story that emerges when one of Glass’s companions, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), tries and fails to get paid for his labor. He learns too late that the system that turns people and animals into commodities is rigged against men like him. And while the simple facts of that system may be too brutal to feed the ambitions of a movie like “The Revenant,” we know that the system nevertheless helped build a nation.“The Revenant” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult companion).

In the opening scene, his mother (Mira Sorvino), addicted to benzodiazepines and dressed only in a bathrobe, crashes her car into a stop sign while driving him to a friend’s house.When she asks him to “keep this between us,” Clark defiantly pulls out his cellphone and reports the incident. She soon checks into rehab. At home, Clark and his careless, self-centered pothead of a father (Greg Germann) engage in a war of attrition. At one point the father loses his patience and curses at Clark, who moves out of the house.The film, which benefits from a moody piano-based score by David Shire, suggests a torpid, updated spinoff of “Ordinary People” by way of “The Bad Seed,” as reimagined by Todd Solondz, with the parent-child roles reversed. But spoiled children make terrible surrogate parents. When Clark’s sullen English teacher (Kieran Culkin), who is having an affair with a student, gives Clark a grade he doesn’t like, Clark bullies him into changing it.Clark’s self-righteousness is accompanied by a creepy lack of boundaries in dealing with the opposite sex. When a prospective girlfriend rebuffs his advances, he ends their friendship and bad-mouths her on social media. He insinuates his way into the household of another girlfriend (Morgan Turner) and edges up seductively to her beautiful mother (Saffron Burrows), who shoos him away.Dysfunction and a sense of entitlement govern the behavior of the characters in the film, which portrays upscale American life as an ethical vacuum in which selfish, indifferent people act on impulse without regard to the consequences. “Quitters” is repellent but believable, which makes it a little scary.“Quitters” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language, sexual content and drug and alcohol use.

Leading this spiritual journey are two educators: the Rev. Dr. John A. McGuckin, a priest-theologian of the Romanian Orthodox Church and a professor of Byzantine studies at Columbia and Union Theological Seminary, and Norris J. Chumley, a documentary veteran, columnist at Belief.net and The Huffington Post, and director of media for Columbia’s Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life.Both men are earnest, understated and profoundly respectful of the lore and ritual of the monasteries they visit, at Mount Sinai in Egypt; Greece; Transylvania in Romania; Kiev, Ukraine; and Russia. But they don’t probe deeply, and the answers they draw from monks (and a nun or two) on camera are largely predictable. (“The greatest enemy of prayer is the Devil,” a wizened cleric says.) Their investigations are not enlivened by the narrators’ somnolent commentary and the persistent droning chants on the soundtrack. At least the sight of centuries-old skeletons in subterranean catacombs and the preserved remains of a monk offer a diverting morbidity.The most consistent and useful thread running throughout this enervating travelogue is the value of silence as a path to inner peace, a notion to which any Manhattan dweller can surely attest.MYSTERIES OF THE JESUS PRAYEROpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed  by Norris J.

She’d also like a date to it, but the guy she has in mind, a bland fellow do-gooder, doesn’t get the concept.Happily, though, fate is unkind to the shed containing the prom decorations — is that a “Carrie” homage tucked into a Disney film? — and she has to rebuild them quickly with the help of the school bad boy, Jesse (Thomas McDonell).

287,2010-03-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:11,NEIL GENZLINGER,The Universe Up There,"American space-flight technology has certainly changed in the almost 50 years since Alan Shepard went aloft, and so has filmmaking technology. But “Hubble 3D,” the latest Imax space movie, makes clear that one science has stood stubbornly still: that of the voice-overs for these types of documentaries.“Hubble 3D,” which records a trip made in 2009 by the space shuttle Atlantis to repair and modify the telescope, is dazzling to look at of course. But such ponderous, cliché-heavy narration. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers it, which might lead you to expect something moderately hip; instead it’s that same old leaden drone, which back when space flight was new perhaps conveyed suitable awe but these days just makes you feel as if you’re in a junior-high civics class.The Imax format, thankfully, makes it easy to block out all those “billions” — number of stars, number of light years — that Mr. DiCaprio is dutifully intoning and instead turn things over to your eyes, just letting them feast. An interesting fly-through effect gives the illusion of traveling across the universe, going deeper and deeper into space just as Hubble’s gaze has done. And the concluding image of a giant web of light, a sort of compilation of all that Hubble’s eye registers, is something to see.HUBBLE 3DOpens on Friday  nationwide.Produced and directed by Toni Myers; narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio; director of photography, James Neilhouse; music by Micky Erbe and Maribeth Solomon; released by Imax and Warner Brothers Pictures.

If “Gods of Egypt” were any worse, it might be a masterpiece.It is instead a demented entertainment, an embarrassment of kitsch riches that, in between inspiring giggles and snorts, incites you to consider imponderables like, who greenlighted this, and why? Is there really still a market for would-be spectaculars with cartoonish effects and self-parodying dialogue delivered with “Downton Abbey” drawls? How does a cast like this take shape? Did Mr. Rush sign on first and the others follow like lemmings? And how did Mr. Butler, with his furred musculature and marble-mouthed Scottish accent, become a standard-bearer for midlevel exploitation cinema? If you have tracked the career of the director Alex Proyas (“The Crow,” “Dark City” and “I, Robot”), you may also be wondering what exactly happened here and why.For years, big movie companies have been refining the template set by Mr. Corman, who built a long career with rubber monsters, California Vikings, buckets of blood, and down-and-dirty marketing and distribution. Yet while the mainstreaming of exploitation cinema is old news, more notionally respectable movies tend to tart up their cheap goods with ponderous self-importance and deep-dish ideas. “Gods of Egypt,” by contrast, doesn’t bother with the fig leaf of respectability. It floridly lets it all hang out, embracing its vulgar excesses without justifications or appeals to good taste, which makes it feel more honest than an art-film exploitation item like “The Revenant.” The rewards of “Gods of Egypt” are modest and blunt, but they’re also fairly consistent, even if you’re not stoned.This isn’t to oversell “Gods of Egypt” or to argue that it’s somehow superior to “The Revenant,” each a favorite pastime of self-regarding critic-contrarians. Rather, it is to cheerfully admit that I enjoyed “Gods of Egypt” despite the lazily generic non-story, the dubious Eurocentric casting and (intentionally?) unconvincing effects that make you wonder (another imponderable) why they didn’t just make this an animated picture. As is often the case in many midlevel and even pricier movies of this type, the more that filmmakers try to reproduce or fabricate entire worlds inside a computer, the less persuasive the results are. As is also often true, the aerial views and crowd shots are particularly unnatural and unattractive, and have none of the painterly beauty of Hollywood’s classical-era backdrops.The visual style of Mr. Proyas’s earlier features, with their pools of inky black and boldly defined forms, isn’t much in evidence in “Gods of Egypt.” His more memorable work has a near-hieroglyphic lucidity, summoning up fields of meaning in a single shot, as with the eerie, fedora-wearing Strangers in “Dark City” and the romantic goth hero at the center of “The Crow.” It’s always an open question as to what kind of control a director has in an endeavor like “Gods of Egypt.” But it’s instructive that even as this movie teases you with its absurdity, it also offers you moments of beauty that shimmer like the outstretched wings of a goddess and moments of wit that surface in a hideaway wittily populated by duplicates of the same god, who’s having a ball talking to himself and himself and himself….“Gods of Egypt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for movie mayhem.

O. SCOTT,Voyage to the Bottom of the Day Care Center,"“Toy Story 3” begins with a rattling, exuberant set piece that has nothing  to do with the tale that follows but that nonetheless sums up the ingenuity, and some of the paradoxes, that have made this Pixar franchise so marvelous and so successful. The major toys — Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), the Potato Heads (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Jessie (Joan Cusack),  Rex (Wallace Shawn) and the others — are in a setting at once wholly unfamiliar and instantly recognizable. They’re in a western, albeit one made in the amped-up modern action style, rather than the more stately idiom of  old-time oaters. A train is hurtling down the tracks; a bridge explodes; stuff is falling out of the sky. There are force fields and laser beams and a big noisy surprise every time you blink.At first glance your heart may sink a little. Can it be that “Toy Story,” built over 15 years and two previous movies out of the unlikely bonds that flourished among a band of beautifully animated inanimate characters (and Andy, the mostly unseen boy who collects them), has succumbed to flashy commercial blockbuster imperatives? Or would we be fooling ourselves to suppose that it has ever been anything else?The resolution of the opening scene in the latest episode shows this to be a false choice. The action is taking place in Andy’s head as he plays with his toys. All those crazy effects are the products of his restless and inexhaustible imagination, which is no less his for having been formed and fed by movies, television  shows and the cheap merchandise spun out of them.And how many real kids who have grown up with Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody have unspooled their own improvised movies on the rec room floor? Perhaps no series of movies has so brilliantly grasped the emotional logic that binds the innate creativity of children at play to the machinery of mass entertainment. Each one feeds, and colonizes, the other. And perhaps only Pixar, a company Utopian in its faith in technological progress, artisanal in its devotion to quality and nearly unbeatable in its marketing savvy, could have engineered a sweeping capitalist narrative of such grandeur and charm as the “Toy Story” features. “Toy Story 3” is as sweet, as touching, as humane a movie as you are likely to see this summer, and yet it is all about doodads stamped and molded out of plastic and polyester.Therein lies its genius, and its uncanny authenticity. A tale that captured the romance and pathos of the consumer economy, the sorrows and pleasures that dwell at the heart of our materialist way of life, could only be told from the standpoint of the commodities themselves, those accretions of synthetic substance and alienated labor we somehow endow with souls.Cars, appliances, laptops, iPads: we love them, and we profess that love daily. Its purest, most innocent expression — but also its most vulnerable and perishable — is the attachment formed between children and the toys we buy them. “I want that!” “That’s mine!” Slogans of acquisitive selfishness, to be sure, but also articulations of desire and loyalty. The first “Toy Story” acknowledged  this bond, and “Toy Story 2” turned it into a source of startlingly deep emotion.When Woody chose life with Andy and the others over immortality with Stinky Pete at the museum, he was embracing a destiny built on his own disposability. When we grow up, or just grow tired of last year’s cool stuff, we don’t just put away those childish things, we throw them out. “Face it, we’re just trash,” says a bitter pink teddy bear near the end of “Toy Story 3.” Though the movie, directed by Lee Unkrich from a script by Michael Arndt (“Little Miss Sunshine”), labors to dispel the gloom of this statement, it can’t entirely disprove it.As Andy prepares for college, Woody surveys the depleted ranks of his pals, noting that some have passed on (rest in peace, Wheezy) and  reassuring the others that everything will be fine. They’ll live in the attic until the next generation comes along. But instead they wind up at the Sunnyside Daycare Center, which at first seems like a paradise where the problem of obsolescence has been magically solved. Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear (Ned Beatty), its seemingly jovial patriarch, explains that there, toys are played with every day, and when one group of youngsters outgrows them, another cohort arrives. It’s a perfect reversal of the single-owner predicament, and most of the toys are relieved and happy — especially Barbie, voiced by Jodi Benson, who finds a Ken with a fabulous wardrobe and the voice of Michael Keaton.The change of scene, and Woody’s subsequent journey to the home of a little girl named Bonnie (Emily Hahn), allows the filmmakers to introduce a bevy of new toys, including a talking phone and a purple octopus who sounds a lot like one of the hosts of “The View.”“Toy Story 3,” which makes remarkably subtle use of 3-D,  also explores a range of cinematic techniques undreamed of in the first two chapters, and refined in recent Pixar films like “Wall-E” and “Up.” There are swiftly edited action sequences worthy of a “Bourne” movie; low-angle compositions and nimble tracking shots; changes in the color saturation and the texture of the light — just like in a “real” movie! When the truth about Sunnyside is revealed, the movie has fun evoking prison escape pictures and horror films, darkening the Pixar palette to captivating (and, to some small children, possibly frightening) effect.In providing sheer moviegoing satisfaction — plot, characters, verbal wit and visual delight, cheap laughs and honest sentiment — “Toy Story 3” is wondrously generous and inventive. It is also, by the time it reaches a quiet denouement that balances its noisy beginning, moving in the way that parts of “Up” were. That is, this film — this whole three-part, 15-year epic — about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love. We all know money can’t buy it, except sometimes, for the price of a plastic figurine or a movie ticket.“Toy Story 3” is rated G (General audiences). Some of the mean toys might be a little scary, and the danger the nice toys face becomes pretty intense at times.TOY STORY 3Opens on Friday   nationwide.Directed by Lee Unkrich; written by Michael Arndt, based on a story by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Mr. Unkrich; directors of photography, Jeremy Lasky and Kim White; edited by Ken Schretzmann; music by Randy Newman; production designer, Bob Pauley; produced by Darla K.

Spinning heads? Pea soup?” Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins), a Jesuit who has performed thousands of exorcisms, inquires sarcastically of Michael Kovak (Colin O’Donoghue), an earnest young American seminarian in “The Rite.”As the son of an undertaker preparing for the priesthood Michael is familiar with gruesome evisceration. In the throes of a spiritual crisis that threatens his faith, he has traveled to the Vatican, where he is dispatched by the sinister, glowering Father Xavier (Ciaran Hinds) to witness Father Lucas practice his brand of hocus-pocus. Father Lucas’s current subject, Rosaria (Marta Gastini), is a pregnant 16-year-old who has been raped by her father and exhibits signs of demonic possession. Contorting her body, raking her fingernails against the wall, the poor girl, if you’ll pardon the joke, is going through hell.Michael is certain that her symptoms, no matter how alarming, must have a medical explanation. Is it the devil’s work or a psychiatric disorder? That is the spurious debate that sputters along in this dull, pretentiously verbose movie that (need it be said?) enthusiastically takes the devil’s side.This supernatural thriller —  suggested by Matt Baglio’s book, “The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist,” and directed by Mikael Hafstrom (“1408,” “Derailed”) from a screenplay by Michael Petroni (“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader”) —  is billed as having been inspired by true events. Without head spinning and bilious regurgitation, “The Rite” is a workmanlike B-movie that embraces as many of the genre’s clichés as a PG-13-rating allows.The demonic voice that growls from within Rosaria is not as frightening nor is its language as colorful as Mercedes McCambridge’s effusions in “The Exorcist,” this subgenre’s flamboyant granddaddy, now going on 38 years old. As for those clichés: it rains heavily much of the time, and rumbles of thunder signal the devil’s proximity. So do the yowls of stray cats in Father Lucas’s yard. There is an infestation of tiny chirping frogs, and a mule with red eyes materializes from of one of Michael’s nightmares.Most important, nobody, but nobody, cracks the semblance of a smile unless it is a Mephistophelean grin. Why? Because life is very, very serious, and evil is too prevalent for there to be room for laughter, pleasure, enjoyment or humor of any kind. The predominant facial expression is a suspicious, paranoid acknowledgment of universal complicity in diabolical evil. “The Rite” fruitlessly throws in a nonlove interest in Angeline (Alice Braga), a glum reporter who witnesses the strange goings-on and is impressed.At least you can count on Mr. Hopkins, whose Father Lucas is eventually possessed by the devil, to deliver an expertly hammy variation on his “Silence of the Lambs” performance. Even when playing virtuous characters, Mr. Hopkins conveys an insinuating ambiguity. It’s in his too-mellifluous voice, his too-cognizant gaze, his jack-o’-lantern smirk. Under the devil’s spell his face suggests a Jared L. Loughner mug shot 50 years down the line. Study it long enough, and you might turn to stone.“The Rite” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence, frightening images and mild sexual references.THE RITEOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Mikael Hafstrom; written by Michael Petroni, suggested by the book by Matt Baglio; director of photography, Ben Davis; edited by David Rosenbloom; music by Alex Heffes; production design by Andrew Laws; costumes by Carlo Poggioli; produced by Beau Flynn and Tripp Vinson; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

291,2016-06-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:24,MANOHLA DARGIS,"Review: In ‘Warcraft,’ Orcs of a Different Domain, Fighting With Heart","Probably the best way to experience “Warcraft,” a generally amusing and sometimes visually arresting absurdity, is stoned. If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn’t your idea of a good movie time, though, I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow. You may not grasp who the Bluto-like creatures with simian arms and woolly mammoth tusks are or why they seem permanently engorged with rage. But there’s more to movies than narrative coherency, as anyone who has sampled the cinema of Michael Bay or certain art films well knows.There is in this movie, for starters, the visual appeal of those Blutoesque beings, lovingly fabricated and ornamented motion-capture creations who share their name with the creatures that J. R. R. Tolkien called orcs. Tolkien borrowed orc from the Old English, citing “Beowulf,” one of the many tales of blood lust and vengeance, heroes and monsters that are woven into the “Warcraft” DNA. The ruler here is King Llane (Dominic Cooper), a rather progressive monarch who fights the invading orcs with a multihued army, a rakish aide-de-camp (Travis Fimmel), a token chick (Paula Patton) and a magical twosome (Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer).If there’s a mythology here, I missed it, much as I also missed the charm and periodic lightness of Tolkien’s world, with its hobbits and Shire. “Warcraft” by contrast weighs in as a Hobbesian war of all against all, though it does allow for a little romance and campy winks. It also, more surprisingly, offers some gray-shading, notably with Durotan (Toby Kebbell), an orc chieftain with hands as big as Volkswagen Beetles and a pregnant mate, Draka (Anna Galvin). He has qualms as well as enemies, which surface amid battles and exposition. Stuff happens in one part of this world, and other stuff happens elsewhere: Jaws clench, bodies fall, and scenes oscillate — ’twas ever thus, genrewise.Even so, despite the incessant clashing and clanging, you can hear the tremulous pulse of a heartbeat. That faint thrumming belongs to Duncan Jones, the director who, against the odds, has mined a watchable movie out of an entertainment franchise that started with a video game and now includes novels, comics and assorted schlock (toys, costumes, a mah-jongg set). That Mr. Jones even factors into this production counts as some kind of actual achievement given that “Warcraft” is such an obvious bid at brand expansion, which may be why no one bothered with an intelligible story. Apparently, branded content (i.e., the characters, their world) was meant to be enough.Whether you see more here will depend on your mileage and patience, though moviegoers habituated to he-men (and the perfunctory she) pulverizing one another for 100 or so minutes are likely to have greater tolerance for this diversion than others might. As suggested, trying to figure out who’s doing what to whom and why — or how orcs dress with such huge hands or how they chew steak with those tusks — is often pointless when it comes to spectacles. In cinema’s earliest years, moviegoers thrilled not to stories but what the scholar Tom Gunning calls “the cinema of attractions,” with its eye-pummeling shocks and tricks; we’re still getting pummeled, story or no.Mr. Jones doubles down on the action, though without any real shocks (or awe), but he also modestly complicates the question of the monstrous. The orcs in “Warcraft” prove somewhat more psychologically complex than any number of cartoon Hollywood villains — they’re sincere, for one — and they’re generally better company than the king and his crew. It says something about Mr. Jones’s choices that he gives Durotan so much screen time and that Mr. Kebbell, with the help of the special-effects wizards, makes good use of that time with a nuanced, moist-eyed turn that evokes old-studio gladiators like Victor Mature. Durotan is a beautiful brute, and all the more human for it.“Warcraft” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Heads pop like grapes and so forth. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.",0,,,0

One minute, the nightmare endured by Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), a nonmilitary truck driver in Iraq who is buried alive  and held for ransom, is a pulse-elevating thriller that wants to prick your deepest terrors of claustrophobic confinement.The next minute, it asks you to be outraged at the supposed indifference of American bureaucrats, whether government officials or private contractors, to their employees in the Middle East. (The story is set in 2006.) In the movie’s cheapest, most exploitative gesture — just as it is about to run out of tricks — a snake slithers into the pine box in which Paul awakens bound and gagged, not knowing where he is. With that gimmick, the movie sacrifices its last shred of integrity.The film, directed by Rodrigo Cortés from a screenplay by Chris Sparling, begins in darkness; the only sign of life is the heavy breathing of Paul as he regains consciousness. Awakening in a panic, he frees himself from his restraints, grovels to find a cigarette lighter and surveys his underground prison. For a while he yells and kicks and tries to pry loose the boards of his subterranean coffin.Discovering a cellphone with a full battery and a pen that he uses to scrawl numbers, Paul begins making calls: to his family, to his heartless employer, to the F.B.I. and to the State Department. At a certain point the device rings, and Paul’s Iraqi captor demands $5 million for his release, then delivers a half-baked political diatribe. Eventually the kidnapper insists that Paul make and transmit a cellphone video plea for help; Paul’s American contacts warn him not do it.The nastiest running joke concerns technology. Paul’s efforts to communicate are stymied by poor cellphone reception, answering machines and inane voice mail. He is repeatedly put on hold and transferred. At moments of crisis the wonderful gadgets that are supposed to make communication easier turn out to make it more difficult. Paul’s ability to complete calls halfway around the world from a box buried in the desert may be a technological miracle, but the very same technology allows people to evade connection and responsibility.Mr. Reynolds has never been a deep actor, and the emotional demands of his role are beyond his range. The crude screenplay does him no favors. As much as he sweats, screams and curses, you never feel that he has grasped the core of a man in such desperate straits. Either Mr. Reynolds was directed to rant and rave, or his bellowing tantrums are meant to signal that Paul is a childish fool who isn’t very bright. Anyone in this situation would eventually realize that talking in a calm, deliberate tone might convince a listener that he is not a crank.“Buried” is sloppy in many of its details. The fuel in Paul’s lighter never seems to run out, and his cellphone battery lasts for the whole movie. Paul repeatedly complains that he can hardly breathe and is running out of oxygen, but after 94 minutes (the real time of the story), he is still conscious.If you shrug off its pretensions, “Buried” works as a manipulative stunt that gets your adrenaline pumping (you may want to bring the Xanax). It should have remained content to be just that: a humble, feel-bad thrill ride.“Buried” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has abundant profanity and some violence.BURIEDOpens on Friday  in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco.Directed and edited by Rodrigo Cortés; written by Chris Sparling; director of photography, Eduard Grau; music by Víctor Reyes; art directors, María de la Cámara and Gabriel Paré; costumes by Elisa de Andrés; produced by Adrián Guerra and Peter Safran; released by Lionsgate.

Her only platonic connection is with Nate (Noah Taylor), a former Army interrogator in Iraq who willingly confesses to a childhood spent torturing small creatures. Erica doesn’t seem to mind: she senses his damage and tentatively shares her own. But when Franki (Marc Senter), one of Erica’s former one-night stands, reappears bearing terrible news, a chain of events is unfurled that will prove impossible to break.Unfolding without a superfluous second or gratuitous image, this morally nuanced thriller owes much of its haunting mood to Milton Kam’s dreamy cinematography. As a lulling, hourlong montage of naturalistic scenes gives way to terrifying violence, the images begin to blink like a startled eye. Thanks to some very fine editing from Rob Hall, these flashing snippets of brutality are even more disturbing than a steady, gloating gaze.Like Mr. Rumley’s bizarre 2006 feature, “The Living and the Dead,” “Red White & Blue” proves the director a bona fide storyteller with more tools in his arsenal than shock and awe. There is horror here, but never groundless: just people fumbling with emotions too big to contain and instincts too raw to discipline.RED WHITE & BLUEOpens on Friday  in Brooklyn.Written and directed by Simon Rumley; director of photography, Milton Kam; edited by Rob Hall; music by Richard Chester; production design by Josh Crist; costumes by Tessa Justman; produced by Mr. Rumley and Bob Portal; released by IFC Films.

It’s a bitter victory. There is little that’s secure about the job, which requires Thierry to view not just every customer but also each employee as a potential thief. Supplemented with the trappings of the badly paid — a stifling tie, ill-fitting jacket, squawking walkie-talkie — he embodies 21st-century labor at its most heroically alienated. As he stands and watches, liberty seems a distant promise, as do equality and fraternity.Gently harrowing in its scary familiarity, the story picks up 20 months after Thierry (an excellent Vincent Lindon) was laid off from his longtime previous job. He’s struggling to regain his equilibrium, his place in the world, his sense of personal dignity, but it’s a tough, at times humiliating struggle. It might also be an impossible one, though not for a lack of effort on his part. The movie opens on Thierry seated in a bureaucratic drone’s cramped, anonymous office and plaintively venting about a training course that hasn’t produced the desired results. “How can I pay the bills?” he asks. “Bottom line, no job.”As he does throughout, the director, Stéphane Brizé, leads with his strength: his star. Framed in profile, Mr. Lindon delivers his lines with a stubborn insistency that feels two objections away from becoming something more volatile. A dependable presence in contemporary French cinema whose recent credits include Claire Denis’s “Bastards,” Mr. Lindon has the weathered, approachable good looks of a real person (and a French movie actor). It’s a face that has miles on it, the kind that suggests there’s a story behind every crease and can also, depending on the role, register as stoic or world-weary, brooding or slightly dangerous, sometimes all at once.Mr. Lindon’s physically reserved, inward turn as Thierry (wrinkled brow, downcast eyes) dovetails with Mr. Brizé’s restrained realism. (Mr. Lindon won the best actor prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival for this performance.) Much of the movie consists of compact, direct scenes that add details to the larger emerging portrait while providing a tangible, lived-in sense of Thierry’s ordinary life; how, for instance, he holds on to a worklike routine, even if it means cleaning his family’s kitchen. Over time, you also learn that he has a wife and a disabled son, and that he has tired of meeting his fellow laid-off workers, some of whom are still agitating to fight their former employer.It’s too bad that the movie’s blunt original title — “La Loi du Marché,” or “Market Law” — was traded in for something prettier and blander. “The Measure of a Man” suggests stirring possibilities (“Of all things the measure is man,” as the philosopher once put it), but it doesn’t convey the ordinary cold brutality of what it means to be defined by the unpaid and the radically underpaid hour. Mr. Brizé, who wrote the script with Olivier Gorce, doesn’t break ground here. Yet, with Mr. Lindon’s help and in several extraordinary scenes in the market’s back office — a white hell in which people are pushed to sell out one another — Mr. Brizé transforms one individual’s story into a social tragedy.“The Measure of a Man” is not rated.

Why he’s in Philadelphia, of all cities, is never explained.

E-mails sent to her by another woman, implying a homosexual relationship, were discovered on a computer at her military base. And Alexandra, vigorously denying any sexual activity while in the service, must choose between a hearing to prove that contention and an honorable discharge. Because she is gay and closeted, she reluctantly leaves the service, with no idea what to do with the rest of her life. But she is more stoic than bitter.Ms. Weber (Mr. Farr’s wife) anchors the movie with a gritty, honest performance that has the same to-the-bone quality as Melissa Leo’s in “Frozen River.” There’s not a false note or inflection.Alexandra passionately loved military life, and as she walks around the town she hears military marches in her head.Adrift, she overindulges her fondness for tequila and reconnects with old friends while keeping her secret from all but one. Alexandra’s composure crumbles when that friend takes her to women’s night at a local bar and she is terrified of being discovered.The town, plagued by a crystal meth epidemic, has gone downhill. Early in the story, when Alexandra helps apprehend a drug-addicted couple caught shoplifting, the sheriff gives the 20-year-old woman, Saffron Snow (Paris Pickard), a choice between prison and the military. Then he suggests that Alexandra take Saffron under her wing and prepare her for boot camp. She agrees.Fiercely defiant at the outset, Saffron gains self-esteem from the grueling physical rituals Alexandra puts her through, and they form a deepening mentor-protégé bond that (thank Heaven) doesn’t take the path toward awakening romance.Pungent set pieces include a barroom arm-wrestling match in which Alexandra defeats local louts, who are certain (as one sneers) that “the strongest woman is equal to the weakest man.” That contest ends in a drunken brawl. A raucous game of paint ball conveys the rugged camaraderie of these tough small-town residents.One of the losers in the arm-wrestling match is a vindictive meth addict who takes such offense that he stalks Alexandra and surreptitiously snaps pictures of her kissing a woman she meets during her foray into lesbian nightlife. It is the first sign that the movie is losing its footing.“A Marine Story,” which won the best United States feature award at the Outfest in Los Angeles, finally topples over with a violent showdown in a meth lab that arrives out of the blue and feels tacked on. Until it loses its balance, the film is as trusty and upstanding as its protagonist, who is given to pithy one liners like “Marines don’t cry; their eyeballs sweat.”My favorite — “Failure ain’t the falling down; it’s the staying down” — describes exactly who Alexandra is.A MARINE STORYOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written, directed and edited by Ned Farr; director of photography, Alexandre Naufel; music by Craig Richey; production design by Michael Fitzgerald; costumes by Wendy Range Rao; produced by J D Disalvatore, Dreya Weber and Mr. Farr.

During the movie’s first half we appear to be seeing what he and his crew have spent their time on while waiting for “those people” to arrive: documentary, or documentary-style, footage shot in rugged Portuguese hill towns during the vacation month of August. Bands play; a wild boar is hunted; villagers recount local tales of drunken mayhem.Midway through the film, with no real warning, Mr. Gomes’s “screenplay” kicks in, and the actors — who have been present all along, introduced as villagers or traveling musicians during the documentary segments — proceed to play out a slightly lurid family drama within the context that’s been established: of rural gossip and church-mandated repression. (In real life the script is credited to Mr. Gomes, Mariana Ricardo and Telmo Churro.)How you respond to this midfilm segue may determine how you rank “Our Beloved Month of August.” If you feel that it grows in complexity (in a good way) and you enjoy the conceit, brought home during the closing credits, of the movie’s meanings being out of the filmmakers’ control, you may rank it very high indeed. And any viewer can appreciate the beauty and style of some of Mr. Gomes’s set pieces, like the long shot of two lovers crossing a bridge as a pair of towering puppets pass in the other direction, or the scene in which two partygoers suddenly begin quarreling in song, applauded and booed by the other guests.You may, though, feel that the film begins to sag at the moment that the balance turns toward fiction, and that a chill sets in. Playfulness shades into detachment; real emotion, which would throw off Mr. Gomes’s scheme, is replaced, Almodóvar-style, by lush pop music and visual metaphors (a forest fire, a mural of the solar system). And the whole turns out to be less than the sum of its elegantly constructed and cleverly uncategorizable parts.OUR BELOVED MONTH OF AUGUSTOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Miguel Gomes; written by Mr. Gomes, Mariana Ricardo and Telmo Churro; director of photography, Rui Poças; edited by Mr. Churro and Mr. Gomes; music by Ms. Ricardo; produced by Luís Urbano and Sandro Aguilar; released by O Som e a Fúria and FiGa Films.

The film begins in Northern California, which has experienced at least one refinery accident, and where clean-energy initiatives — Sungevity, Solar Richmond — are hiring and training area residents.With brisk, fluid concision, the film jumps to countries fast-tracking solar energy production: Germany and China, which is “now the leading country in terms of how fast they are implementing sustainable technology at really large scale,” according to Peggy Liu, chairwoman of the nonprofit Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy.Fascinating portraits stand out. In Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, founder of Conservatives for Energy Freedom, advocates solar energy’s growth within a free market, rejecting the idea that it’s a left-versus-right issue. Zhongwei Jiang, an entrepreneur in Wuxi, China, lived without electricity until he was 7. Capitalizing on the Chinese government’s investments in renewable energy, he founded WesTech, a solar business, in 2003. Now it is finding partners in Germany, and, he says, growing by 50 percent every year.Van Jones, an Oakland, Calif., lawyer and activist who wrote the best seller “The Green Collar Economy,” wasn’t so fortunate. His efforts earned him an appointment as the Obama administration’s special adviser for environmental jobs. But vociferous opposition to him from the former radio and Fox News personality Glenn Beck and Republicans in Congress forced his resignation. The battle for a greener tomorrow, we are reminded, has its casualties.",1,,,0

This documentary’s subjects variously describe the garment as an expression of, and a denial of, femininity; a source of beauty and a concealment of it; a backward-looking symbol and a modern fashion accessory.Early on, a mother and daughter argue about the hijab’s merits, with the mother having decided to go without it, feeling that it makes her look old. Dr. Ahmed Barqawi, identified as head of philosophy and social studies at Damascus University, frames the views over the hijab as, essentially, a conflict between different reasons for wearing it — ideological and personal.Sarah Joseph, editor of Emel Magazine in Britain, considers her hijab an expression of religious identity in a country that’s reserved about religion. As the movie trots through Europe and the Middle East, academics and clerics weigh in on the hijab’s purpose and scriptural basis. Some interviewees note its changing use over time.The movie also looks beyond individuals to explore perceptions of the hijab in society. (In a moment no doubt intended to upend expectations, one wearer is shown practicing martial arts.) The subject matter makes “The Tainted Veil” much more visually interesting than many issue-oriented documentaries, though the thriller-like score goes too far in trying to counter dryness.",0,,,1

Dwarfed but not diminished by the stupefying beauty of the film’s western Ireland location, the two leads  act out a story as simple and ancient as the hills that surround them.When a young, flame-haired hitchhiker (Lotte Verbeek) arrives at the isolated Connemara cottage of a quiet widower (Stephen Rea) and finds it empty, she boldly enters and pokes around. Like Goldilocks she rolls in his bed, leaving a titian hair on the pillow. Much later she will curl herself around his motionless body, demonstrating needs that she can’t, or won’t, articulate.Offered food in exchange for work, the woman refuses to divulge even her name, answering only to “you.” But as the widower, tempting her with lobster and the classical music she loves, gradually chips away at her defenses, the film evolves into a muted meditation on the tension between companionship and solitude, affection and independence.Yet having introduced two characters as mysterious to us as to each other, the writer and director, Urszula Antoniak, faces the challenge of involving the audience in their near-wordless relationship.Enter the cinematographer Daniel Bouquet, who envelops them in a world of extraordinary sensuality. We can almost taste the golden potatoes boiling on the stove, touch the tangles of seaweed fertilizing the garden.

While her mother, Sandy (Jennifer Garner), struggles to adjust to their new neighbors’ plastic smiles, Medina’s father, Phil (Justin Kirk), decides to moves on, leaving Medina and her twin brother, Jim (the newcomer Cody Fern), in their mother’s increasingly unstable care.Directed by the brothers Brendan and Emmett Malloy, “The Tribes of Palos Verdes” portrays the cultish fixations that can arise within volatile families. As the mother forces the weight of her sadness onto her son, the father pushes his daughter to be his advocate with his estranged wife, and the son projects his anxiety onto his sister. As Medina’s world churns, she takes up surfing, which gives her the only head cool enough to narrate this tale of family dysfunction.It is the film’s great fortune that the Masons are portrayed by an exceptional team of actors, starting with Ms. Monroe, who is the calm eye at the center of the storm. The bellows of this tempest come from Ms. Garner, who ably depicts the demanding neediness of the vulnerable matriarch. Yet the Malloys’ filmmaking never rises to the level of the actors’ nuanced performances. The actors are energized, but the camera enervates. The colors have been bled from the California sunshine, and the camera alternates wanly between shaky close-ups and indifferent establishing shots. In “The Tribes of Palos Verdes,” even the sea seems stifled.",0,,,0

Aside from the difficulty of spoofing a saga that has always been winkingly aware of its own angsty excesses, there is the inadvisability of angering a tweeniverse whose emotional investment in the originals borders on pathological.But this is the world of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the less-than-sophisticated force behind “Epic Movie” and “Meet the Spartans.” Their recipe is to aim low, season with references to image-challenged celebrities — Tiger Woods, Lindsay Lohan — and pile on the genitalia jokes. Hewing mostly to the plots of the first two films (“Twilight” and “New Moon”), this pointless parody dumps us in the fictional town of Sporks, Wash., a location lousy with vampires and werewolves. That gives Becca Crane (Jenn Proske), the newest and twitchiest kid in town, plenty of options for inappropriate dating.Enter Edward (Matt Lanter), the only immortal who has yet to graduate from high school, and Jacob (Chris Riggi), an American Indian saddled with multiple nipples and a stringy tail. Torn between two suitors — undead or unneutered? — Becca resorts to sleepwalking and sexual provocations. But it’s tough to lose your virginity when one boyfriend has chosen celibacy and the other would rather chase cats.As bloodsuckers and shape-shifters crawl all over our media (with at least five shows on television alone), their presence on the big screen is likely to leave us more tired than tingly. Though it’s useful to learn that even vampires can be repelled by flatulence — maybe we should eat that garlic instead of draping it on our windows.“Vampires Suck” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Her partner in crazy-time fame, Brad Pitt, helped keep the balance in “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” their only film together. And now Johnny Depp tries to do much the same in “The Tourist.” Going for muted, eyeliner- and nearly irony-free, he plays an ordinary American who bumbles into a Continental intrigue, which looks like a film you’ve seen before, because you have.You know that movie. It’s the one in which Cary Grant and Grace Kelly don’t just travel by train, they also trade knowing looks in the first-class dining car as the waiter fills their glasses, and a shady type secretly takes their photo. The people behind “The Tourist” would like you to flash back to 1955 — as Ms. Jolie’s wardrobe of long gloves suggests  — a risky strategy, given that you actually might. The truth is that it takes an exceptional director to prevent an entertainment as flimsy as this from collapsing under its own weightlessness. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off with Grant and Kelly in “To Catch a Thief,” a bauble that sparkles like a jewel because of the world-class scenery, its stars included, and because of, well, the directing.Stargazing is the only reason bonbons like “The Tourist” are made, dreams of box office bonanzas aside. But stars need just the right setting and a director who knows how to make them shine, as Steven Soderbergh does with Mr. Pitt and George Clooney in the “Ocean’s” franchise. The director also needs to hold his own, which, from the generic look and feel of “The Tourist,” clearly wasn’t the case with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. He does put personality into the occasional scene, including a mysterious, hushed interlude in which Ms. Jolie stands with her back to the camera as Mr. Depp creeps up from behind — lover or stalker, you’re not initially sure which — before pulling her close for a hungry kiss.It’s a nice idyll among a wash of clichés that include Russian muscle in service to a big meanie, Shaw (Steven Berkoff), whose quest for stolen loot leads him to Elise Ward (Ms. Jolie). A mystery woman of rare ability (she can pick a lock and wear off-the-shoulder gowns), she eludes Shaw while dodging assorted law enforcement agencies, including Scotland Yard, where Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton curl stiff upper lips. Elise pauses long enough to slide into a train seat opposite Frank Tupelo (Mr. Depp), who, after gulping at his good fortune, explains that he’s a vacationing Wisconsin math teacher (as if!). Dinner leads to drinks leads to complications, including hailstorming bullets and a few sluggish boat chases in the Venice canals.Hollywood has a long history of collecting (and devouring) European directors, but Mr. von Donnersmarck was an odd choice for froth like this. A few years ago he attracted some attention for “The Lives of Others,” a 2006 drama about an East German couple being spied on by a Stasi officer. Here, his main job seems to have been to find new and flattering ways to shoot Ms. Jolie as she catwalks from Paris to Venice in soaring heels. He tries to invest this adoration with some self-conscious wit, mostly by having all the men in the movie gawp at Elise as if she were as much a supernova as the one playing her. But all this genuflection — she parts one crowd as  Moses does the Red Sea — feels forced rather than mischievous.It must be tough for Ms. Jolie to find roles that fit. Off screen she remains a fascinating presence, but on screen she now tends to overwhelm her roles and even her movies. Like every memorable screen star, she still has a face you can get lost in, with its push-pull of hard, jutting angles and well-endowed lips. It’s a face built for extremes, though early on she could also make it work for somewhat smaller, human-scaled roles that were nonetheless tricky for her. Superheroes and superfreaks have long been her truer calling, one reason that “The Tourist” seemed vaguely promising. When she first appears in a come-hither outfit and a small private smile, she looks ready for liftoff. She never ignites, and neither does the movie.Mr. Depp doesn’t fare better with a role that forces him to play meek and disappointingly  mild, despite a few screenwriter-supplied tics. (Mr. von Donnersmarck shares writing credit with Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes.) A brilliant character actor and accidental movie star, Mr. Depp has rarely been persuasive playing average. He likes tunneling into his characters, preferably under a thick smear of makeup and flamboyant threads, which is why he’s never made sense in mainstream romance. There’s no place for him to hide with Frank, so he stands around trying to look hapless as Ms. Jolie grabs the lead. There’s definitely some amusement in watching her come to his rescue, a role reversal the movie only flirts with. But oh how much more fun it would have been if Mr. Depp had really played the girl, eyeliner  and all.“The Tourist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

GOLD,"Review: In ‘The Birth of Sake,’ a Brew Made With Pride and Lots of Patience","Chronicling a season at a small family-owned brewery, Erik Shirai’s “The Birth of Sake” is an engrossing introduction to the traditional cultivation of the rice-based alcohol that is part of Japan’s cultural heritage. But the film’s true focus is an endangered way of life.The Yoshida Brewery, in Ishikawa Prefecture, has been making sake for more than 140 years, using artisanal means — that is, touch, taste, sight and smell, instead of just machines — to steam, sift and ferment the rice into a premium sake brand, Tedorigawa. About a dozen employees leave their families from October to April for the plant, where they live together while following the directions of Teruyuki Yamamoto, the 68-year-old toji, or head brewmaster. They eat, sleep, sometimes even bathe together, rising at 4:30 a.m. for a workday that often runs past 8 p.m.Yachan Yoshida, 28, is being groomed by his father, the company’s president, to be the sixth generation of his family to lead the brewery. Eager for the challenge — “The brewery will always be where I feel most at peace,” he says — he knows its survival is not assured. Young workers willing to put up with a life this demanding and immersive are hard to come by; as important, the sake market in Japan is shrinking, and the mass brands that do well often lack the nuance and subtle textures of the artisanal brews.Mr. Shirai nicely shuffles in the back stories of several workers, and his shots of sky, sea and early morning landscapes could fit amid Hokusai woodcuts. At 94 minutes, the film’s pacing drags at times. But as Mr. Yamamoto might say, it takes what it takes. You can’t rush the process.",0,,,0
305,2010-07-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:11,MIKE HALE,When Pets Reach Across the Aisle,"Kids say the smartest things. A few minutes into a screening of “Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,” a child near me turned to his mother and asked, “Why is Kitty Galore called Kitty Galore?”Exactly what I was wondering. I tried to hear her whispered answer but couldn’t. It was short, so she probably hadn’t bothered telling him that someone thought it was a good idea to name a children’s movie after a crude double-entendre in an old James Bond film, or explaining what “cynical” means.As recently as this spring the trade papers were still calling the film “Cats and Dogs 2,” the title it carried through eight years and at least three directors. (Brad Peyton ended up doing the honors, in his feature debut.) “Kitty Galore” is the long-awaited, much-inflated sequel to the 2001 hit “Cats & Dogs,” which established the cute premise of these species locked in a secret (to humans) battle for global pet domination.The original was an innocuously charming comedy with a story built around the fate of a human family. The sequel is something much more common: a bloated spy-and-action-film pastiche, predicated mostly on the Bond movies but throwing in jokey references to “Scarface,” “The Terminator,” “Mission: Impossible,” “The Silence of the Lambs,” “Get Smart” and so on.There’s a story, involving a disgraced police dog recruited for the worldwide canine intelligence agency who finds himself (spoiler alert) cooperating with a slinky feline counterpart to bring down the renegade cat of the title (suavely voiced by Bette Midler). It’s merely a frame on which to hang the endless old-movie gags and shaggy dog jokes. (“He’s been in and out of kennels his whole life.” “Someone’s been playing catch with the ugly stick.”)The human actors are fewer and more poorly used in the sequel. Chris O’Donnell barely appears as the partner of Diggs, the K-9 cop. The only two-legged performer who figures prominently in the plot (besides a pigeon, voiced by Katt Williams, who provides the requisite squawking-ethnic comic relief) is Jack McBrayer of “30 Rock.” He plays a bumbling carnival magician in a series of scenes opposite a hairless cat, and for perhaps the first time on screen, he’s not funny.A significantly larger amount of money was spent this time around on animation and puppetry to supplement the live-animal cast. Another chunk of the budget went to the post-production 3-D conversion, done in South Korea (much like elective cosmetic surgery). It doesn’t add much, though the scenes of the animal heroes, rigged with jet packs, flying over San Francisco at night are enjoyably queasy-making.There are a few other funny notions, like the shot of a roomful of kitties high on catnip and blissing out to “Get Together.” Mostly, though, “Kitty Galore” is a grind, as well as proof that “What up, dog?” isn’t any funnier when a pigeon says it to a dog.“Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

And yes, he succeeds in getting inside that closed country, under the guise of cultural exchange. But what he thinks he’s accomplished by doing so is never very clear, and the product — sloppy even by guerrilla filmmaking standards — has no revelations to offer that are worth the slog of watching it.Mr. Brugger takes along two collaborators, Jacob Nossell and Simon Jul, who are Danish-Korean comedians. Mr. Nossell has a disability that, among other things, leaves his speech difficult to understand; he refers to himself as a spastic.“If the North Koreans ever were able to understand the Danish language,” Mr. Brugger says, explaining how he hopes to get the troupe’s commentary by the North Korean censors, “they would never be able to understand spastic Danish.”When the three get to North Korea, they are assigned to a handler, identified only as Mrs. Pak, who monitors their every move and, of course, lets them see only what the government wants them to see. So the film has nothing to show but pretty buildings and pretty people; Mr. Brugger is reduced to asserting, over these images, that terrible things are happening in other parts of the country. Certainly true, but we already knew that from more authoritative sources.The most compelling person in the film ends up being Mrs. Pak, who seems kindhearted and well intentioned. The question of whether a person can buy into a repressive regime and still retain her humanity hangs over this film but is left unexplored.THE RED CHAPELOpens on Wednesday  in Manhattan.Directed by Mads Brugger,  based on his original idea; director of photography, René Johannsen; edited by Mr. Johannsen; costumes by Simon Jul; produced by Peter Engel, Zentropa RamBUk;  released by Lorber Films.

Revisiting the story of Wong Fei Hung, a martial arts master whose life has passed into Chinese folklore, “Legend” takes place in 19th-century Guangzhou, where two crime factions vie for control of the docks. This movie’s Guangzhou is a marvel: sprawling, detailed, abounding in narrow alleys and vivid street scenes.Alas, the plot and subplots are variations on time-honored Hong Kong cinema devices: The young Fei (played as an adult by Eddie Peng) grows up training alongside a buddy, Fiery (Jing Boran); both pine for the same woman, Chun (Wang Luodan), a minder of street waifs. Fei, a formidable warrior, is adopted by the kingpin Lei Gong (the kung fu movie veteran Sammo Hung), only to subvert his empire. When Chun and Fiery lead an insurrection and torch Lei Gong’s opium dens, furious but graceful brawls (orchestrated by the renowned fight choreographer Corey Yuen) erupt.Mr. Peng has charisma, though his moves are less convincing than those of an earlier Fei: Jet Li, in Tsui Hark’s 1991 classic “Once Upon a Time in China” (and less humorous than those of Jackie Chan, who played Fei in “The Legend of Drunken Master,” a.k.a. “Drunken Master 2,” from 1994). But “Legend” does offer the hefty authority of Mr. Hung, who at 64 can still — almost — hit, kick and do wire work with the best of them.",0,,,0

And in “Manhattan Night,” a classic film noir set in contemporary New York, his character, Porter Wren, is a scuttling tabloid columnist ensnared in an elaborate story of deception, blackmail, murder and sexual duplicity. In its complexity and zest for evil, the plot rivals that of “Chinatown.” The story even has its own Maltese falcon, in the form of a priceless green jade figure of a horse. But what sounds so delicious in the telling is pallid and ludicrous onscreen.Lean and bony-faced, Mr. Brody, a producer of the film, adapted from Colin Harrison’s 1996 novel, “Manhattan Nocturne,” exudes a hard-boiled Bogartian cynicism that doesn’t feel forced and is softened with flashes of poetry in his eyes. Married to a doctor (Jennifer Beals, playing a generic faithful wife), with whom he has two young children, Porter might be described as a rat with a bleeding heart. When a beautiful woman puts the moves on him, he can’t resist.The movie, written and directed by Brian DeCubellis, has enough sleazy characters and plot twists to whet the palate of the most jaded mystery fans. At the heart of the story is a blond femme fatale, Caroline Crowley (Yvonne Strahovski) whose demonic husband, Simon (Campbell Scott), a world-famous filmmaker, is addicted to extreme practical jokes. After his dead body is discovered in a sealed-off building that is about to be demolished in Upper Manhattan, Caroline entices Porter, who has a history of successful journalistic sleuthing, to investigate the circumstances of Simon’s death.As with many films noirs, the plot of “Manhattan Night” doesn’t bear close scrutiny. The movie is painfully conscious of its 1940s forerunners, in which a lone dedicated gumshoe slithers through the underbelly of a city (usually Los Angeles) and encounters layer upon layer of corruption and evil.You can tell that “Manhattan Night” wants to be true to that tradition. But Mr. DeCubellis’s efforts, though obviously sincere, fall completely flat. You can’t turn an old upright typewriter into a computer by polishing the keys.Caroline is being threatened by Sebastian Hobbs (Steven Berkoff), the glowering plutocrat who has just purchased the failing tabloid for which Porter writes. Mr. Berkoff plays him as a Sydney Greenstreet type whose behavior doesn’t add up once his secrets are bared. The most disappointing performance is Ms. Strahovski’s as Caroline, a character so lacking in passion or inner life (some frantically steamy love scenes with Porter notwithstanding) that “Manhattan Night” feels blank at the center.Some of the missing vitality is supplied by Mr. Scott’s Simon, a flamboyant player of mind games who in one stunt fakes his own death just for the fun of watching Caroline’s face when she discovers him. Mr. Scott injects the movie with a maniacal zest that suggests Dennis Hopper’s character in “Blue Velvet.” Simon is obsessed with shooting cellphone videos. One involves Hobbs and is so embarrassing he will go to any lengths to retrieve it.Unlike the juicy, overripe prose in the novel from which it was adapted, Mr. DeCubellis’s screenplay is utterly lacking in style. Mr. Brody captures his character’s attitude, but the colorless screenplay robs the character of literary imagination. The look of the movie is as washed-out as the screenplay. Manhattan looks dull and prosaic, without mystery and glamour. The difference between the film and its source is the difference between “night” and “nocturne.”“Manhattan Night” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual situations, violence, nudity and strong language.

A young man with a head for numbers, he’s married with two kids and a third on the way, and has a bright future as a vice president for a local bank. He has stayed in the neighborhood and away from the mob ties that entangle his friends and family. At least until his father-in-law, Benny (Paul Sorvino), a lieutenant for the neighborhood don, brings him to the boss, Manny, who needs a favor. “This is good for us,” Benny promises.A minor entry in the mobster movie catalog, “The Brooklyn Banker” at least wears its influences on its black polyester sleeve. One recurring set is a street fair similar to the Feast of San Gennaro in “The Godfather: Part II” and “Mean Streets.” Indeed, “Mean Streets” is shown headlining a local movie marquee, and Manny is played by David Proval, who starred in that film.Mr. Proval also appeared on “The Sopranos,” and “The Brooklyn Banker” is thick with that crew as well. The movie’s director, Federico Castelluccio, played Furio, the Italian hit man who became Carmela’s object of desire, and he finds roles here for the “Sopranos” alumni Arthur J. Nascarella and John Bianco.So much pedigree, so little payoff. Written by Michael Ricigliano Jr., the film is a feature-length expansion of a short called “Lily of the Feast,” and it shows. Acting chops are occasionally on view — Mr. Sorvino and Mr. Proval play well together — but the plot is weak, the subplots tacked on. If you’re going to run with a tough crowd, you’ve got to make a statement. “The Brooklyn Banker” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence, threatened and otherwise, and salty language.",0,,,1

It’s ‘The Searchers and Vampires’!” That realization will keep you amused for a few minutes, but it becomes clear pretty quickly that the only real thought in the movie has gone into the cowboy-gothic costumes and the computer-generated effects.“Priest” is what you get when you open a male geek’s toy box and dump everything on the floor: John Ford, Sergio Leone, comic books, throwing stars, computer-enhanced martial arts, a runaway train, schoolboy Roman Catholic rebellion and Maggie Q in skin-tight vestments.Mr. Bettany is the Ethan Edwards of the piece, a clerical ninja living in a post-vampocalyptic world in which the humans cluster in dingy cities, and the vampires are imprisoned in underground “reservations.” When a band of renegade vamps kidnaps the priest’s niece, he sets out with a young sidekick to find her, vowing that he will kill her if she’s been infected. (Yes, the “Searchers” parallels are that literal.)The film, based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels, has nice, washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles, but there’s nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice. (And the American Indian-vampire metaphor is too bizarre to bear much thought.) There are two things worth watching: Mr. Bettany, who makes an excellent latter-day Wayne and can put across nearly all of the aspiring-to-second-rate dialogue, and Maggie Q, who has a Jolie-like ability to project intelligence and emotion while looking scorching hot.“Priest” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence.",0,29100000.0,29136626.0,0

Watching it is like slowly leafing through a giant scrapbook whose contents include the individual stories of a large extended family.Buffeted by war and political upheaval, Samir’s relatives, who are seen at different ages and in different places, belong to the Jamal Aldin clan, a well-educated line of professionals who trace their ancestry to the Prophet Muhammad. They became secularists during the period, beginning in the 1920s, of British rule. Today they belong to a diaspora of Iraqi émigrés scattered across the globe. Family members have landed in places as far-flung as Auckland, New Zealand; Buffalo; London; and Zurich, where Samir settled with his Swiss wife. Late in the movie, Samir remarks with some bitterness that since settling there, he hasn’t made a single friend.To begin to grasp the magnitude of the family’s collective travels would take at least two viewings of the film accompanied by a who’s-who chart of its members and their peregrinations.For American audiences, conditioned to view Iraq through the lens of contemporary wartime journalism as a primitive fractious land of Shiites, Sunnis and other sects in continual conflict, the documentary will be a revelation. Not so long ago Iraq was much more westernized than it is today, and scenes of Iraqis in Western garb, living comfortable middle-class lives in happier times, puts a lump in your throat.Samir playfully compares the family history to Homer’s “Odyssey,” and throughout the movie there are flashes of scenes from “Ulysses,” a 1955 movie starring Kirk Douglas. If “Iraqi Odyssey” is a Homeric parable, he suggests, Iraq is the equivalent of Penelope, patiently waiting for Odysseus to return. But in this version Penelope loses patience and marries one of her suitors. There isn’t a triumphant homecoming, and it is doubtful whether, given all that has happened, such a homecoming is possible, but one can still dream. There is a joyful family reunion; it is not on Iraqi soil but in Switzerland.The family history is inseparable from the history of the country. In the 1950s, members of the clan flirted with Communism, but they weren’t infatuated with Marxist ideology so much as encouraged by the Communists’ determination to improve the lives of the working class. At a crucial turning point, one family member recalls, the Baath Party, which was solidifying its power, out of which emerged Saddam Hussein, waited in vain for help from the Soviet Union. He theorizes that the outcome of the Cuban missile crisis prevented the Soviets from intervening; they didn’t want another confrontation with the United States.From here, things go mostly downhill. Hussein’s rise led to Iraq’s pointless eight-year war with Iran, and the worsening horrors of his dictatorship, followed by the American invasion of the country. For all the politics described in the film, “Iraqi Odyssey” never becomes bogged down in strident rhetoric and analysis, although the family members who chose to settle in the Soviet Union instead of Britain regret their decision.The members of the Jamal Aldin clan are resilient, articulate, intelligent, attractive and cosmopolitan. They make the best of a bad situation. What is remarkable is the clan’s cohesion, despite being separated by thousands of miles. They sadly acknowledge that the homeland they were forced to flee barely exists anymore. The country, one family member says, has “gone back 500 years.”“Iraqi Odyssey” is not rated.

Plans to demolish the homes and build a new development have drawn opposition from an Israeli-Palestinian coalition seeking to preserve the site.“The Ruins of Lifta,” an achingly poignant documentary by Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky, investigates a debate in which dueling narratives collide — just as they do everywhere in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Mr. Daum is an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, and a son of Holocaust survivors. He and Mr. Rudavsky have explored before, in “Hiding and Seeking,” how Mr. Daum’s family history had taught him to think the worst of non-Jews. Here, Mr. Daum’s questioning of that perspective leads him to recognize that tragedy had begotten tragedy: “The Holocaust and Nakba narratives are not exclusive,” he says. “I do not have to choose between them.”Mr. Daum makes friends with Yacoub Odeh, a Palestinian in the coalition; interviews other Palestinians driven from Lifta; and hears accounts from Israeli historians. Despite all the good will, though, rifts exist, even among coalition members; as long as Israel remains an occupying force, Mr. Odeh says, there are lines that cannot be crossed.The coalition wins a court ruling, and development plans are delayed. While the film is meant to be hopeful, it just feels very sad. Mr. Daum introduces his friend Dasha Rittenberg, a Holocaust survivor, to Mr. Odeh, but the two end up in a heated, though civil, debate.

Israel, Esq.,’ Denzel Washington as a Lawyer Out of His Element","Partly because of economics, partly because of a lack of imagination, Hollywood barely makes character-driven movies anymore. So there is a sense in which “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” a wildly idiosyncratic drama about a wildly idiosyncratic lawyer, deserves not only critical leniency, but also maybe your investment.Yet this film doesn’t do the cause many favors. It certainly doesn’t serve Denzel Washington, in a role unlike any he has played that nevertheless saddles him with a collection of tics meant to compensate for the underrealized complexity of the part. And it offers tonal whiplash for viewers, with several potentially great ideas that don’t settle into a coherent whole. The movie starts in the vein of a ruthlessly intelligent drama like “Michael Clayton” before racing through adversity, running a couple of unearned victory laps and landing just shy of a mawkish Will Smith vehicle like “Seven Pounds.”The film was written and directed by Dan Gilroy, whose “Nightcrawler” centered on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a monomaniacal cameraman whose lack of a moral compass allowed him to succeed in local television news. Roman Israel (Mr. Washington) is equally single-minded in his pursuits, but otherwise he’s Lou’s opposite: a hapless striver whose compulsions interfere with his ambitions.Roman keeps to his office in a small Los Angeles firm. He is a whiz with briefs and apparently knows the legal code by number, but his partner is always the one who appears in court, having more tolerance for what Roman calls the “butchery” of plea deals and excessive sentences. When the partner has a heart attack, Roman, who can’t run the firm alone or stop himself from talking back to a judge, eventually takes a job with George Pierce (Colin Farrell), a high-flying lawyer who doesn’t necessarily share Roman’s ideals.A veteran social reformer with a dated hairstyle and glasses that only exaggerate his awkwardness, Roman is almost certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. In a performance that’s meant to grate, Mr. Washington highlights the character’s difficulty making eye contact and his habit of laughing and smiling with too much emphasis. As intriguing as it is to watch a movie about someone who is gifted yet hamstrung by his own mind, you do wonder whether — after Roman and Lou — Mr. Gilroy is capable of writing protagonists who aren’t so affectedly at odds with their environments.The fish-out-of-water clash at the firm is absorbing enough, but the movie misfires when it appoints Roman as a sort of an angelic figure (or, as his last name may signal, a prophet). Carmen Ejogo appears as a younger civil rights advocate who, unlike the other activists we meet from her generation, recognizes Roman’s past contributions and explains that she feels privileged to know him. Roman even begins to grow on George, who inexplicably warms to him just as Roman is wreaking havoc at the firm. And when Roman makes not one but two symbolic getaways — one to Santa Monica, one to the desert — “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” seems like a movie that has no idea where it’s heading.While “Nightcrawler” delivered its bludgeoning lecture on TV sensationalism about four decades too late, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” goes oddly easy on the cruel bureaucracy of the legal system. Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not. Mr. Gilroy, perhaps similarly caught between integrity and commercial calculation, gets as lost as his hero.",0,11887893.0,11851274.0,0

O. SCOTT,"In ‘99 Homes,’ a Man Buffeted and Then Manipulated in Florida’s Foreclosure Disaster","“Don’t get emotional about real estate.” That bit of wisdom — among the mantras shared by a predatory broker named Rick Carver — is both upheld and defied by “99 Homes,” Ramin Bahrani’s stunningly effective melodrama of flipped houses and mortgaged souls. While the film hardly endorses Rick’s coldblooded, dog-eat-dog view of the world, it is too cleareyed to oppose his ruthlessness with soft, easy appeals to sentiment. The foreclosed properties Rick acquires and resells may be repositories of hopes, dreams and family memories, but they’re also economic units, “boxes” to be emptied out, refilled and written down on a balance sheet. That’s a fact of life, and also a tragic contradiction.Dennis Nash learns this lesson the hard way. A skilled construction worker idled by a sour economy — “99 Homes” seems to take place around 2010, in the recessionary aftermath of the financial crisis — Dennis (Andrew Garfield) is unable to keep up with his mortgage payments and so loses the modest house where he lives with his mother, Lynn (Laura Dern), and his young son, Connor (Noah Lomax). At the stroke of a pen, their world has come undone, and Mr. Bahrani captures the scene of his dispossession with almost unbearable precision, plunging the viewer into a storm of agonized feeling as Dennis struggles with rage, grief and shame at having been pulled, in front of his neighbors, into the ranks of society’s losers.In contrast, Rick (played with tiger-shark ferocity by Michael Shannon), could conduct a self-help seminar on how to think, act and dress like a winner. With an e-cigarette clenched between his teeth, a pistol strapped to his ankle and a cellphone glued to his ear, Rick may be heartless, but he certainly isn’t dumb. His assessment of the brutalities of the housing market in Central Florida — and of the Darwinian logic that underlies them — is hard to dispute. The bubble has burst, and as homeowners like Dennis find themselves underwater, trapped in treacherous and complicated loans, Rick is on hand to clean up the mess, or at least to profit from it. Compassion is for suckers, and one man’s misery is another’s opportunity.He shows up on eviction day, backed up by sheriff’s deputies and bank documents, to tell families that they are now trespassing on property they thought was theirs. The furniture goes out on the sidewalk and the residents enter a spiral of downward mobility. Some plead for more time, others wave papers and invoke lawyers, and a few threaten violence, but the result is always the same. Dennis, Connor and Lynn wind up sharing a room in a motel overflowing with families in similar circumstances. Maybe the game is rigged, or maybe the laws of nature just work that way. It hardly matters to Rick — or to Dennis, whose passage from Rick’s victim to his protégé forms the main axis of the film’s narrative.Three of Mr. Bahrani’s earlier features — “Man Push Cart,” “Chop Shop” and “Goodbye Solo” — were exemplary works of American neo-neorealism, using mostly nonprofessional casts and a stripped-down shooting style to tell stories of economic striving and spiritual struggle. Like the original Italian neorealists (and like the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, their most prominent present-day heirs), Mr. Bahrani is especially interested in how the material circumstances of his characters affect their moral decisions. The need for money, and for the security, dignity and status it brings, can force terrible choices on people, but hard times and systemic injustice don’t absolve anyone of ethical responsibility.Mr. Bahrani went a bit astray with “At Any Price,” an overplotted, overacted movie with Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron as a father and son trying to save their family farm. With “99 Homes,” which he wrote with Amir Naderi, Mr. Bahrani has recovered his balance and sharpened his already formidable knack for concise, emotionally potent storytelling. True to its neorealist pedigree, the film works partly as a fable, an illustration of how impersonal forces shape individual human destinies. Its palette of feeling includes a bright streak of anger at the way banks, judges and politicians conspire to bully and bamboozle hard-working people like Dennis, and also at the way the pursuit of wealth has eclipsed all other sources of value in our lives.But if “99 Homes” is a scolding look at a society gone astray, it is also a minor masterpiece of suspense, as tightly wound as “Sicario,” Denis Villeneuve’s white-knuckle drug-war thriller, and almost as brutal. Not that there’s much in the way of physical violence: fists are raised now and then, and weapons are sometimes brandished. But the threat of destruction is pervasive, and everything — the hand-held camerawork, the swift editing, the anxious music by Antony Partos and Matteo Zingales — contributes to an overpowering sense of danger.Mr. Garfield, who was an annoyingly needy Spider-Man, is entirely credible as a man risking his decency to protect himself and his loved ones. When Dennis starts carrying out evictions for Rick, his natural empathy proves to be an asset. He can give predatory capitalism a friendly human face. Mr. Shannon, though, is the film’s center of gravity — its supernova, its black hole, its avatar of cosmic disorder. Like Michael Douglas in “Wall Street” or Alec Baldwin in “Glengarry Glen Ross,” he is the seductive embodiment of capitalist amorality, a handsome devil offering a small amount of cash for your house keys and slightly better terms for your immortal soul.Some of the suspense comes from the realization that Mr. Bahrani has taken a big risk of his own. As Dennis’s inner conflict becomes unbearable, you may start to become aware of the traps “99 Homes” has set for itself, and to anticipate endings that seem too bleak, too soothing or too sensational to fulfill the film’s promise. But the ending, if I may say so without giving anything away, is just right, absolutely consistent with Mr. Bahrani’s acute, impassioned understanding of contemporary American reality. The final shot is at once perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous, a reminder that some contradictions are more easily understood than resolved.“99 Homes” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Economic horror. Class violence. Real estate porn.",1,,27000.0,0

O. SCOTT,Manhattan Is for Lovers: Two by Two by Two by ...,"“New York, I Love You” is the second installment in a franchise of urban anthology films that began in Paris and is scheduled to touch down soon in Rio, Shanghai, Mumbai and Jerusalem. My own sentimental heart is holding out for Dayton, Ohio. Eventually, like a cinematic version of Google Earth, these movies, the brainchild of the producer Emmanuel Benbihy, will cover every inch of the globe with big-name actors and tiny romantic epiphanies. It may not be a project that will make the world smaller or friendlier — only, perhaps, a bit more precious.Not that the 11 shorts in “New York, I Love You” are all that bad. It’s a nice-looking city, after all, even if the interstitial skyline and traffic montages assembled by Randy Balsmeyer are about as fresh as the postcards on sale in Times Square. Each vignette was shot in two days, and the roster of directing talent includes Mira Nair (“The Namesake” and the forthcoming “Amelia”), Fatih Akin (“Head-On” and “The Edge  of Heaven”) and Natalie Portman, making her debut behind the camera. (She also plays a Hasidic diamond broker in Ms. Nair’s contribution.)But in spite of some attempts at human and neighborhood variety, the stories have a  self-conscious sameness, as if they were classroom assignments in an undergraduate fiction-writing class. Which, in a way, they are. Each filmmaker seems to have staked out a different part of town, though only one, Joshua Marston (“Maria Full of Grace”), has ventured beyond the tourist-friendly precincts of Manhattan. Apparently nobody loves Queens, the Bronx or Staten Island. Or Harlem, for that matter. And while the ideas of love explored on the East and West Sides are sometimes platonic, parental or intergenerational, they are also predominantly white and heterosexual.Nobody should expect the directors, a pointedly non-hometown team — other notable names include Yvan Attal from France, and Jiang Wen from China — to plumb the depths or mine the grit of the real New York. They have, instead, composed a flurry of valentines to a fantasy version of the city, one culled from other movies and also from literature. You might get a hint of Martin Scorsese or Woody Allen here and there, but just as pronounced are the inflections of J. D. Salinger, Paul Auster, O. Henry and many decades’ worth of contributors to the Talk of the Town section of The New Yorker.All of which might be tolerable in small doses, but somehow, once they are stitched together, the pieces of “New York, I Love You” make up a parallel city that no one would want to live in, much less visit. And this is in part because most of the New Yorkers on display here are confections, hothouse flowers planted in a soil of arch dialogue and watered with studied sprinklings of surprise.These people have a funny — actually a tiresome  —  habit of not being what they seem, at first, to be. Thus the young man (Anton Yelchin) in Brett Ratner’s prom-night anecdote (in which, by the way, no cars burst into flames) allows himself to be fixed up with the daughter of an avuncular pharmacist (James Caan). The girl is played by the charming Olivia Thirlby, and a morsel of drama is produced by her date’s discovery that she uses a wheelchair.That situation plays out more like a smutty shaggy-dog story than a sweet slice of life, but Mr. Ratner and Jeff Nathanson, who wrote this section, seem to be working, in their literal-minded way, from the same template as other, more overtly poetic contributors. Chance meetings have a way of yielding  reversals that seem as diagrammed as chess moves. Men in particular — a young thief (Hayden Christensen), an obnoxious pick-up artist (Ethan Hawke), a middle-aged businessman (Chris Cooper) — receive comeuppances that only they fail to anticipate. The women who supply them (including Robin Wright Penn and Maggie Q) tend to be savvier and more enigmatic, but no less limited.It’s somewhat surprising how plot driven, how shaped, the chapters in “New York, I Love You” seem, given the current vogue for open-ended, observational cinema about city life. I’m thinking of younger American directors like Andrew Bujalski and Barry Jenkins (whose “Medicine for Melancholy” could just as well have been called “San Francisco, I Love You”) and also of the filmmakers who have brought cities like Taipei, Tehran, Bucharest and Buenos Aires to rough and vivid life over the past decade.New York, like Paris and Los Angeles, is both overexposed and underexplored in movies, and of the love letters assembled here only two linger in the mind after this 110-minute speed-dating session is over: Ms. Nair’s diamond-district encounter (with Irrfan Khan as well as Ms. Portman), and Allen Hughes’s impressionistic study of the anxious aftermath of a one-night stand, starring Bradley Cooper and Drea de Matteo. Otherwise you would glimpse more interesting stories, and more arresting images, on a twilight cab ride across the East River.“New York, I Love You”  is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

A big-hearted, back-in-the-day tribute — and a stand-alone argument for public-school music programs — Mark Landsman’s bittersweet documentary has designs on your feet, heart and mind.Celebrating a black Texas high school band that, from 1968 to ’77, vaulted over the color barrier to win nationwide contests, lay down albums and travel to Japan — with financial support from, of all people, Alabama’s governor at the time, George C. Wallace — the film is a riot of impossible Afros and irresistible beats.Anchored by a 2008 reunion concert in honor of the band’s former teacher, the 92-year-old musical firebrand Conrad O. Johnson Sr. (known to everyone as Prof), a wealth of archival film resurrects a time of civil unrest and racial friction. While the middle-aged alumni, some of whom haven’t touched an instrument in decades, face the daunting task of whipping themselves into performance shape, their spirited interviews bless the day Prof chose a hometown girl and a high school gig over a blossoming musical career. By introducing funky licks, fancy footwork and many of his own compositions to the band’s stodgy set list of jazz standards, this indomitable leader (whose declining health adds a poignant twang to the film’s final scenes) instilled racial pride alongside musical competency.The power of the tunes remains valuable, but the legacy of an inspirational teacher?

These men are soon rolling up their sleeves to terrorize activists and anyone else considered a threat to their government.The campaign, Operation Condor, that inspired this fictional film was a reality in South America from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, when right-wing dictators in Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and several other countries, reacting to a perceived threat from leftist dissidents, had their political opponents kidnapped and executed.The focus in this Bolivian film is mostly on a retired general (Damián Alcázar) whose memories of his past linger. Convalescing after a heart attack, he confesses his role in a letter to his son, who apparently was unaware of the true nature of his father’s work. As if echoing a fever dream, “Olvidados” frequently lurches back in time, showing the general’s role in the persecution of a group of activists and a journalist (Carloto Cotta) and his pregnant wife (Carla Ortiz, also a producer of the film and one of its three screenwriters). At times, the less-than-graceful transitions are accompanied by the crackling sound of electricity, in case you missed the scenes of detainees’ being electrocuted. (Some of the technical flourishes evoke one of those basic-cable shows with cheesy re-enactments.)In dark detention centers overrun with mice, bloodied detainees debate the dangers of extremism by those on the right and the left as well as what constitutes a democracy. The opening breezes through archival footage from the era, dossiers on dictators and newspaper clips. While it would be a tall order to fully elucidate this complicated history in two hours, “Olvidados” is hamstrung by Mr. Bolado’s lack of focused direction and a convoluted plot.",0,,,0
318,2016-10-06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:25,GLENN KENNY,Review: ‘Homeland: Iraq Year Zero’ Chronicles a War-Torn Family,"Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq was despotic, oppressive, criminal and worse. Yet something that Westerners can recognize as “ordinary life” took place in certain sectors of Iraq during his rule. The Iraq-born filmmaker Abbas Fahdel, who has long resided in France, chronicles his own extended family’s everyday life in Iraq in 2002 in the first half of his two-part film, “Homeland: Iraq Year Zero,” opening on Thursday. Shooting on video in his brother’s home near Baghdad, he shows his niece and nephews watching television one morning; a piece of state propaganda referring to Hussein as “Beloved Leader” soon gives way to a Looney Tune cartoon featuring Foghorn Leghorn.Family members and neighbors seem close to one another in “Before the Fall,” the first half of “Homeland,” although their houses are separated by concrete walls. There’s a bit of squabbling when Mr. Fahdel’s family digs a well. The residents know war is coming; they’ve seen it before. The current state of the neighborhood has been defined, it appears, more by foreign incursions and sanctions than by Hussein. In any event, the people depicted are cheerful and congenial, even when they boast of the victory they expect to achieve should any American dare to set foot on their territory.A little over an hour into “Homeland,” in a bit of text barely distinguishable from the English subtitles, Mr. Fahdel tersely imparts a piece of information concerning one of the film’s subjects. It’s a blink-and-you-miss-it moment that both makes the heart sink and lights a fuse. Subsequent moments of lightheartedness, including a scene at a bazaar that’s practically redolent of the multifarious spices sold therein, are freighted with that terrible knowledge. And as Mr. Fahdel depicts the tone of the state propaganda heating up via various living room televisions, a stomach-churning tension mounts.What’s coming can’t be stopped, we know. The film’s second part, “After the Battle,” is a little surprising in that it depicts its subjects trying to maintain ordinary life amid the rubble and military checkpoints. American soldiers are shown treating the citizens of the land they invaded as if they were minor nuisances, like insects. Yet Mr. Fahdel’s family responds to its new reality with a kind of resigned resilience. (While the movie doesn’t reprise Vice President Dick Cheney’s confident assertion that the United States forces would be “greeted as liberators,” this film, like so many other pieces of Iraq War reportage, lends that prediction an awful, hollow irony.)But resilience cannot resist everything. In the movie’s final moments, certain events that seemed to be portents of a hopeful future are counteracted by wartime catastrophes, including, finally and most terribly, the death of a family member, of which the director had informed viewers (with that fleeting text) in the first half. It is almost unbearable to sit through, which is as it should be. “Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime,” Ernest Hemingway wrote. “Homeland: Iraq Year Zero” is both an irrefutable proof of that statement and a nagging reminder that the statement is insufficient to address the ultimate tragedy of war.“Homeland: Iraq Year Zero” is not rated. It is in Arabic, with English subtitles. Running time: Part 1, 2 hours 40 minutes; Part 2, 2 hours 54 minutes.",1,,,0
319,2011-09-01,We Were Here,"Ed Wolf, Daniel Goldstein, Guy Clark, Eileen Glutzer",USA,"David Weissman, Bill Weber(co-director)","Documentary, Biography, History",English,94.0,90.0,,2011,7.8,1733.0,10.0,2017-11-02 04:18:13,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"In a City’s Plague Years, Caring for Their Own","“There was nothing extraordinary about the fact that you lose the people you love because it’s going to happen to all of us,” observes Ed Wolf, a gentle, gay San Franciscan in his mid-50s who devoted years to counseling dying AIDS patients during the peak of the epidemic. “It’s just that it happened in this targeted community of people who were disenfranchised and separated from their families. And a whole group of other people stepped up and became their family.”The family or community, whatever you want to call it, that coalesced around a public health emergency is the story of “We Were Here,” an extraordinarily moving, beautifully edited documentary directed by David Weissman (“The Cockettes”) and Bill Weber. Mr. Wolf’s remembrance of how the city’s gay and lesbian citizenry united and mobilized to care for its own establishes the film’s steady elegiac tone.“We Were Here” is an unblinking chronology of the epidemic, recounted by five people who lived through it and watched countless friends and lovers die. The disease infected roughly half of the city’s gay male population, killing more than 19,000 by the end of 2009; some 15,000 more, sustained by a life-extending cocktail of drugs that became available in the mid-’90s, were living with H.I.V. The film’s before-and-after pictures of joyful, carefree young men reduced to haunted, hollow-eyed skeletons covered with the lesions of Kaposi’s sarcoma evoke World War II photos of concentration camp prisoners.As grim as some of its images are, “We Were Here” is above all a film about love: not romantic love but the kind that really matters, in which people selflessly show up and keep on showing up for one another in the worst of times. The experiences of Mr. Wolf and of the film’s other eloquent witnesses — Paul Boneberg, Daniel Goldstein, Guy Clark and Eileen Glutzer — profoundly changed their lives. These are people who didn’t run away and hide; you want to hug them.Mr. Wolf, who recalls being “terrible at anonymous sex,” notes how he belatedly found a way to bond with gay men as a volunteer caregiver for the Shanti Project. Mr. Clark, a former dancer turned florist and a 30-year resident of the Castro neighborhood in San Francisco, who donated funeral flowers to men whose resources were exhausted by their illness, talks of finding his spirit.Mr. Boneberg, a hippie from Buffalo who briefly lived on a commune, served as executive director of Mobilization Against AIDS, one of the first such activist organizations, and became something of a political firebrand. He remembers the divisive issue of whether to close the bathhouses, which had been considered “core institutions” of the city’s gay culture, at the epidemic’s height. He was a leader of the successful campaign to defeat an AIDS quarantine ballot initiative proposed by Lyndon LaRouche.The right-wing attacks never gained traction, Mr. Boneberg suggests, because the compassionate response of San Francisco’s gay and lesbian residents helped demolish the stereotype of homosexuals as selfish, amoral hedonists.Mr. Goldstein, a New York-born sculptor who founded Visual Aid and Under One Roof, nonprofit organizations that generate money for education, medical and support services, is himself H.I.V.-positive. Amazed to have survived after losing two lovers to AIDS, he says he has just begun to accept that he has a future. Ms. Glutzer, a feminist and a nurse, cared for the dying at San Francisco General Hospital and helped supervise the clinical trials of several AIDS drugs.The story begins in the late 1970s, when the Castro became a mecca for gay men drawn to the city’s free-spirited, post-hippie ethos in an era of sexual liberation.“If you took a bunch of men and said, ‘Have as much sex as you can,’ how much sex would they have?” Mr. Boneberg asks. “A lot of sex.” Archival photos of handsome young men, their arms flung around one another like victorious soldiers on the front lines of a cultural revolution, are inescapably poignant.“We Were Here” has a tragic arc. By 1978, when Harvey Milk, the San Francisco city supervisor and so-called mayor of Castro Street, was slain, H.I.V. was already spreading among the gay population, although its presence hadn’t yet been felt. Even then, one man estimates, one-tenth of the population was infected.Mr. Wolf remembers looking in the windows of a drug store where Polaroid photos were posted with a scrawled message: “Watch out, guys. There’s something out there.”“We Were Here” remembers the desperate, often futile search for drugs and the formation of the militant AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, whose actions helped speed the development of the AIDS cocktail that eventually cut the death rate.Personal stories — of a lover who died on the way to the hospital; of a mother who lost three sons to AIDS; of a plane trip to Washington in which gravely ill patients roused themselves from their sick beds to make the journey to advocate for AIDS research; of patients who donated their eyes for research on infections that were causing blindness — are harrowing and inspiring.Throughout “We Were Here” there is not a hint of mawkishness, self-pity or self-congratulation. The humility, wisdom and cumulative sorrow expressed lend the film a glow of spirituality and infuse it with grace.WE WERE HEREOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by David Weissman; edited and co-directed by Bill Weber; director of photography, Marsha Kahm; music by Holcombe Waller; released by Red Flag Releasing..

320,2011-10-14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,RACHEL SALTZ,Multitasking on the Slopes,"“Chalet Girl” may not be particularly creative or genre busting or even a great example of a romantic comedy. But its premise might make you smile: Kim (Felicity Jones), a girl from the wrong side of the tracks — in this case, working-class London — gets a job at the Austrian chalet of a rich family (Brooke Shields, Bill Nighy and Ed Westwick). There she parlays her skills as a former skateboarding champ into snowboarding, becoming an ace while battling class prejudice and catching the eye of the family’s son, Jonny (Mr. Westwick).The most surprising thing about this pleasant if timid movie is how little truck it has with mean-spiritedness. (It could use a bit more for comic oomph.) Even the snooty ski girls who look down on Kim end up cheering for her at the inevitable big snowboard competition.Ms. Jones has a freckle-faced wholesomeness as Kim, who meets adversity and snobbishness with plucky defiance but little resentment. And the faunlike Mr. Westwick from “Gossip Girl” gives Jonny a wistful good cheer that almost makes his class-crossing romance with Kim believable. (He also looks good in ski clothes; everyone else looks like a stuffed animal.)About a kind of girl power, the film nonetheless paints its rich women as shrews (till they soften), while the men are kindly indulgent (when not lecherous). “Chalet Girl,” though, may not be the place to look for trenchant social satire. As Jonny says to his mother, “This isn’t Jane Austen, Mum.”CHALET GIRLOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Phil Traill; written by Tom Williams; director of photography, Ed Wild; music by Christian Henson; produced by Pippa Cross, Harriet Rees, Dietmar Güntsche, Wolfgang Behr and Franz Novotny; released by IFC Films.

321,2011-10-28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,STEPHEN HOLDEN,A Fairy Tale Mix With 9 Lives and Dozens of Egg Jokes,"“Puss in Boots” mixes it all up. Even more than in the “Shrek” movies, from which this likely candidate for a new animated franchise is spun off, it is a cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting. It also looks terrific: brighter, with a lot more visual pizzazz than the “Shrek” films. Even when the story loses its thread, the movie rewards your eye.The tale, revolving around Puss, a popular character first introduced in “Shrek 2,” imagines this vain, spoiled, swashbuckler (voiced by Antonio Banderas) with delusions of grandeur, colliding with Humpty Dumpty, the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, Jack and Jill, and Mother Goose herself. Puss is given a tentative romantic interest in the feisty and seductive Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), who first appears in disguise and eventually becomes his sidekick and partner in crime. Kitty’s tragedy is that she has been declawed, but the movie makes little of it. Despite some perky quasi-flamenco dance numbers, their teamwork never quite soars into Astaire-Rogers heaven.Visually, at least, most of the other transplants from children’s stories are indelible. The avaricious Jack and Jill, voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris, are villainous twangy-voiced old folks who roar around the plains in a covered wagon making trouble. Mother Goose, silent except for her fog-horn honk, is an ominous Godzilla-size bird who swoops down from on high to protect her golden child whom the outlaw partners have stolen from above.Puss has his charms, but he is not as memorable a character as Shrek or Shrek’s mouthy sidekick, Donkey. Consequently the story, which involves a quest for magic beans and golden eggs, feels improvised and diffuse. The most sharply drawn character, Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis), Puss’s erstwhile best friend turned enemy, is also the most complex. Jealous and treacherous, but with a seed of good, he is an animated Rorschach test whose remarkably expressive features register more shades of ambiguity than I can recall encountering in a Hollywood animated character. There are many, many egg jokes.Puss and Humpty Dumpty first meet at an orphanage, where they hatch a dream of acquiring magic beans to grow a beanstalk that they intend to climb into the clouds to steal the Goose That Lays Golden Eggs. But the two are separated before they can realize their plan, and Puss becomes an outlaw. When they meet again, Humpty Dumpty is fuming that Puss betrayed him, but they reteam anyway for an adventure that involves some spectacular midair derring-do.“Puss in Boots” was directed by Chris Miller from a screenplay by Tom Wheeler, who wrote the story with Brian Lynch and Will Davies. Early in the film you have the sense that this picaresque adventure tale had only the sketchiest of master plans. It is too complex and has too many changes of heart to be a smooth, coherent ride. Puss isn’t as clear-cut a personality as he was in the “Shrek” movies. The moral of the story — something about revenge and forgiveness — simply has little resonance.Visually, however, there is much to admire. The movie’s most remarkable feature is a spectacular use of 3-D that raises the bar for a mainstream animated film. Avoiding the usual stereoscopic clichés, “Puss in Boots” often looks multidimensional, especially its action sequences.And unlike the “Shrek” movies “Puss in Boots” doesn’t give you the slightly queasy feeling of being stranded at a Friars Club roast where the talk is peppered with inside show business jokes. The tone of the screenplay is more innocent, and the movie is apparently directed at a slightly younger audience. That’s all to the good.“Puss in Boots” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some adventure action and mild rude humor.PUSS IN BOOTSOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Chris Miller; written by Tom Wheeler, based on a story by Brian Lynch, Will Davies and Mr. Wheeler; edited by Eric Dapkewicz; music by Henry Jackman; choreography by Laura Gorenstein Miller; production design by Guillaume Aretos; produced by Joe M.

The car, viewers of the three previous movies may recall, belongs to Frank Martin, an ex-military operative who rakes in euros helping criminals with getaways and other high-stakes errands.As previously embodied by Jason Statham, Frank was an ace driver and brawler always annoyed at having to ruffle one of his perfectly pressed shirts. The new Frank is played by the reedy and humorless Ed Skrein, who substitutes smarm for Mr. Statham’s deadpan wit. Comic relief has been delegated to a new character, his dad (Ray Stevenson), a retired spy, who addresses his son as “junior,” a dynamic borrowed from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”Frank’s latest client is Anna (Loan Chabanol), who hires him for a robbery in Monte Carlo. Sold into prostitution when she was 12, Anna now vamps about with former co-workers on a revenge quest inspired by the Three Musketeers. (Their use of blond wigs for capers seems patterned after Brian De Palma films.)“The Transporter Refueled” is crass and nonsensical, but it is hard to hate a movie in which a medical anesthetic is administered with a nightclub fog machine, the weapons include a ringed life preserver, an escape from a moving plane continues by car onto a jetway and the touch-screen banking software appears expressly designed for double-crossing.“The Transporter Refueled” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

We Don’t Know","Every so often, an actor takes possession of a role so thoroughly — turning each line, flickering look and gesture into an expression of being — that she becomes your way into the movie as well as the reason you keep watching. That’s the case with Rebecca Hall, the star of “Christine,” a period drama about a television reporter, Christine Chubbuck, that plays more like an autopsy than like a biopic. In 1974 Ms. Chubbuck shot herself on the air, possibly becoming the first person to commit suicide on live TV. The ancient Romans had the Colosseum; we have television.The dangers of TV, at any rate, are a cherished movie trope, included in films like “A Face in the Crowd,” the 1957 satire about a drifter who rises to demagogic power through his TV show. So it seems important that Christine is first seen on a monitor. Seated at a table opposite an empty chair while alone on a set, she is working on her delivery while pretending to interview Richard M. Nixon, the man of the year and soon to be ex-president. It’s a chilled introduction that reads as an attempt at distancing, perhaps to put Christine at arm’s length or to suggest that she will be unknowable.Soon enough, though, the story takes over, as does Ms. Hall. Christine lives with her mother, Peg (J. Smith-Cameron), sharing a cluttered, claustrophobic apartment in Florida. Mother and daughter seem reasonably fine living in close quarters, even with Christine’s mood swings, her intensity and her obsessive work habits. A reporter at a Sarasota television station, she wants to do important stories, as her sit-down with a nonexistent Nixon telegraphs. She does field reporting and tackles serious topics like zoning for a show called “Suncoast Digest,” but she also covers softer, sillier human interest stories involving the latest big news on chickens and strawberries.Christine yearns, including for her colleague George (Michael C. Hall), a cheerfully vacant anchor, but her desires are thwarted by social awkwardness and partly by her caustic boss, Mike (Tracy Letts). “You know what your problem is?” Mike says. “You’re a feminist.” Maybe she is, maybe she isn’t. Christine’s brusqueness at times suggests some kind of second-wave feminist cartoon, the career gal as harridan. She doesn’t know how to play nice and can’t flirt or even make small talk with people she wants to impress, an ostensible character flaw that says more about Christine’s world — its expectations of proper nice-girl, good-girl, attagirl behavior — than it does about her.With her long, dark hair framing her pale face like frayed curtains, Ms. Hall builds her slow-burning performance with both subtly fluctuating expressive details and larger physical gestures, like Christine’s hard-charging walk and way of leaning over in interviews. The severity of the character’s look is matched by her gestural and temperamental abruptness (her elbows fly and flap, forming right angles), her tendency to burst into rooms and turn eerily quiet. When Christine goes still, she seems to fold up within herself, a kind of dampening of affect — a silencing — that suggests that the very life is draining out of her and that, over time, conveys her devastating isolation.The director, Antonio Campos, visualizes her isolation persuasively, but without much feeling or depth. So much sounds and looks right in “Christine,” which was written by Craig Shilowich and has been impeccably kitted out with period atrocities, from the high-waist slacks worn by Christine’s friend Jean (Maria Dizzia), to the loud jacket that George could have borrowed from Ted Baxter, the anchor from “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” a series that could be the movie’s secret sharer. (The excellent cast includes Timothy Simons.) With a muted palette that’s heavy on brown and saves the red for its showstopping moment, the movie looks as depressed as Christine appears.Ms. Chubbuck’s suicide is often wrongly described as the inspiration for the 1976 satire “Network.” “Christine” doesn’t have the rage, reach or aspirations of “Network”; it doesn’t make great political or cultural claims. Instead, even as Ms. Hall’s performance makes you believe that something profound is at stake, the movie noncommittally nibbles at the edge of larger meaning, nodding at current events. There are references to Watergate, the self-help movement and the transformation of news into entertainment. All this embroiders the picture, as does Christine’s mental health and girlish bedroom, but none of this gets at why she pulls the trigger.Maybe there is no explanation. Maybe Ms. Chubbuck’s suicide is meaningful only because of her suffering and the pain her death caused. And maybe it’s because the filmmakers never land on any explanations that they depict a woman singing alone to the theme song from “Mary Tyler Moore.” This reference to that show — a landmark series with a single career woman — is ugly, vulgar in its cynicism and self-regard. It’s also unnecessary because Ms. Hall’s humanizing performance attests that the death of one person can be all the significance you need.“Christine” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

But we do know that many other prisoners followed suit and that the gesture was not futile.“Buried Prayers,” a touching documentary by Steven Meyer, chronicles an archaeological dig to recover some of these objects. But that work takes up only part of the film. The other focus is on who came along to help with the digging: a small group of survivors, now near the end of long lives lived mostly in Australia, where they relocated after the war.Either element — the recovery of the buried objects or the return of the survivors to the scene of their worst nightmares — would have made a decent documentary. Together, they create an aching contrast: these few are living reminders of all the human potential that was lost. The film would be stronger if it told us a little more about what the survivors have been doing since the camp was liberated by the Soviets in 1944, but their reactions to revisiting the camp are wrenching to watch. And when they and the rest of the archaeological team begin unearthing the coins and jewelry that were buried more than six decades ago, the message that the Holocaust victims were people, not just statistics, is loud and clear.",0,,,0

The scenes of the nine-member band, which includes two dancers, in theatrical attire cavorting with the audience in a Lower Manhattan club are beyond joyous. Anthems like “Immigrant Punk,” powered by a frantic pogo beat strung with wild, squealing accordion and violin that suggest demonically fueled klezmer music, generate an ecstatic communal anarchy.Mr. Hütz, a skinny, baggy-eyed live wire with an earring and a waxed handlebar mustache who is partly of Roma descent and who performs shirtless, could be described as the Iggy Pop of an Eastern European sound he says was influenced by Bartok. Having appeared in two films — “Everything Is Illuminated,” with Elijah Wood, and the Madonna-directed “Filth and Wisdom”  — he has become a borderline movie star as well as a postpunk guru.In “Gogol Bordello Non-Stop” he emerges as a passionate, articulate philosopher of punk’s democratic participatory aesthetic who espouses the rejection of social hierarchies in concerts that are raucous, bacchanalian performance-art carnivals.In the movie’s weaker segments several troupe members, who range  in age roughly  from 25 to 50, tell their stories. By far the most compelling is Mr. Hütz’s tale of fleeing Kiev on an odyssey that took him through Italy, Austria, Hungary and Poland, landing in Vermont in 1993 through a relocation program.Near the end of the film he decries how media “brainwashing” and the cultivation of a “celebrity lifestyle” are the almost-too-tempting-to-resist enemies of artistic free expression. So far, it seems, he has held the line.GOGOL BORDELLO NON-STOPOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed and edited by Margarita Jimeno; director of photography, Ms. Jimeno; produced by Ms. Jimeno and Darya Zhuk; released by Lorber Films.

They make a Korean War veteran seem like a master of emotional distance and control when he sticks to real-life parallels in a speech about his memories.The director, however, may have guided the more recent veterans to the subject (their answers sound very similar). Eric Christiansen, whose earlier documentary was “Homecoming: A Vietnam Vets Journey,” has organized the new film neatly by topic: what the veterans were like as small children, how they feel about what they saw and did overseas, what it was like coming home, what post-traumatic stress disorder is, how they have adjusted (with support groups, support dogs, psychotherapy, marathon running) and, finally, how they’re seeking a sense of home.“Searching for Home” is strikingly photographed by Mr. Christiansen and is sure to give comfort and support to countless veterans and their families. For others, there is little new insight, although the film does create an instructive tension between admiring bravery and sacrifice and being appalled by war itself.Most veterans say they feel devastated about having taken human life. A token soldier takes the opposing side. “Every one of them deserves to die and burn in hell,” he declares. “Women, children, old people — doesn’t matter.”The film also presents one woman, a Korean-American who served in Iraq more than a decade ago. Her greatest emotional scars were inflicted not on the battlefield but in her own quarters, in a sexual assault by a man to whom she opened her door (“a friend of mine”). That horror seems like a separate subject, but at least it reminds moviegoers that women also go to war.",0,,,1

Shot with woozy lighting and punctuated with Skype calls and texts, this New York drama in some ways finds new names for age-old insecurities among men and women, though it doesn’t entirely deliver on its promising buildup.Cody (John Gallagher Jr.) and Virginia (Kate Lyn Sheil) are in a sweetly flirtatious relationship that so far has been carried on only at a distance, reassuring themselves with their dedication. Then Cody begins to suspect that Virginia is not actually in Berlin, as she claims, and Mr. Wigon’s film briefly enters a delicious, almost Continental realm of existential ambiguity and obsession.As Cody furtively pursues his doubts, his concerns curdle into disillusionment, as if the life cycle of his relationship — from growth to decay — had been sped up considerably. Virginia’s attempt to compartmentalize her romantic extracurriculars suggests a desire for disassociating to protect herself (portrayed through Ms. Sheil’s ready pose of aloofness). Their experiences bring some tacitly understood mores regarding sex and the Internet uncomfortably into the light.Mr. Gallagher’s nice-guy air and naïve sense of disbelief prove a good anchor for a movie that, visually and tonally, holds back from its characters somewhat. Mr. Wigon ultimately takes refuge in the poetic, but for Cody and Virginia, it feels like too little, too late.",0,,,0

Set in the 22nd century,  when, we are told, Earth has finally had enough of unchecked human  proliferation, the movie unfolds aboard the spacecraft Elysium, a kind of Noah’s ark en route to populate a new planet.Stickily awakened from hyper-sleep, Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster, all systems clenched) find themselves alone and with only minimal memory. How long have they been in space? Where are they going? Why are their faces frozen in a single expression?To answer these and other pressing questions, Bower sets off to locate the spaceship’s bridge and is dismayed to find himself the prey of pale, moist-skinned mutants who resemble a cross between the mole people in “The Descent” and the Reavers in “Serenity.” While Payton amuses himself by yelling, “Bower, do you copy?,” the object of his anxiety is teaming up with a well-padded biologist (Antje Traue) and a well-armed farmer (the mixed-martial-arts world champion Cung Le) and squaring his shoulders to save mankind  — or at least its genetic code, languishing in a laboratory as big as the Superdome.Working from an undercooked screenplay by Travis Milloy, the German director Christian Alvart is an effective manager of atmosphere but an inept choreographer of movement. Fight sequences are shot so closely, so frenetically and with so little light that they’re just a blur of flailing limbs punctuated with flashes of slobbering mutant. Without schematics to show the ship’s layout, neither we nor the characters have any idea where they are in relation to one another. (When the beastie in “Alien” was headed toward you, you knew  it.) So when Bower tumbles into a vast slurry of rotting body parts — perhaps a mass grave, perhaps the mutants’ stock pot — its location is as much a mystery as its ingredients.Emulating the industrial-goth chic of the Nostromo,  Richard Bridgland’s stunning set designs (carefully constructed in a Berlin studio) imagine a clanking womb filled with steam and shadows. Metallic walkways open onto vast, echoing caverns (some scenes were shot in an abandoned power plant), alternately evoking coffinlike claustrophobia and sickening vertigo. According to the press notes, pandorum means “Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome”;  whatever that is, by the end of the movie I was convinced I had caught it.“Pandorum” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Hacksaw Ridge’ Has the Guts and the Glory. But Where’s the Gun?,"Mel Gibson can be accused of many things, but subtlety is not one of them. Even at his worst — I mean as a filmmaker, not a political thinker — he consistently proves to be an able craftsman and a shrewd showman. “Hacksaw Ridge,” the first feature he has directed since “Apocalypto,” a decade ago, is a bluntly effective faith-and-flag war drama, the true story of a remarkable hero with a knot of moral tension at its center.That hero, Desmond Doss, is inscribed in the history books as something of a paradox: a conscientious objector who was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery in combat. A Seventh-day Adventist who refused to carry a gun, Doss served as an Army medic in the Battle of Okinawa. What he did there is easily Googled (and is the subject of Terry L. Benedict’s documentary “The Conscientious Objector”), but I won’t go too far in spoiling a tale that Mr. Gibson retells with vigor and suspense.And also in graphic and gruesome detail. Mr. Gibson’s appetite for gore is without equal in modern Hollywood. Maybe that’s saying a lot, or maybe it goes without saying, but the man is an aficionado — a connoisseur, an epicure, a gourmand — of exploding heads, shattered limbs and burst abdomens. As he did most famously in “The Passion of the Christ,” he once again plunges a man of peace into a charnel house of cruelty, testing the fortitude of protagonist and audience alike.“Hacksaw Ridge” opens with a taste of hell, a battleground that belongs more in a horror movie than in a combat picture. Rupert Gregson-Williams’s jarring, minor-key score plays under a slow-motion tableau of spurting blood, splintering bones, burning flesh and general agony.Then the music changes, the light shifts, and we are in paradise: a hilly, pastoral corner of Virginia years before Pearl Harbor. Young Desmond (Darcy Bryce) and his brother, Hal (Roman Guerriero), chase each other over rocks and streams. Not that they dwell in a perfect Eden. There is a whiff of Cain and Abel in their relationship, and more serious trouble from their father, Tom (Hugo Weaving), a bitter, alcoholic World War I veteran. Though he hates war, the elder Doss is hardly a pacifist, and his violent behavior toward his sons and their mother (Rachel Griffiths) helps push Desmond toward peace-loving piety.Played as a young man by Andrew Garfield, Desmond is a happy anti-warrior, with a goofy grin and wide, trusting eyes. He courts a nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), and their romance is so sweet and squeaky clean — he kisses her; she slaps his face; he proposes — that you might think the old production code was still in effect. And until the fighting resumes about halfway through, “Hacksaw Ridge” often feels like a throwback to an earlier era, a work of careful and calculated nostalgia.When Desmond arrives at basic training, he is introduced to a platoon whose composition — one guy from Brooklyn, another from Texas, a Pole, an Italian, a pretty boy and a hothead — would have looked corny back in the ’40s. And let’s not forget Sarge, a fountain of colorful insults played by Vince Vaughn, who stands out among the mostly Australian and British cast members for his effortlessly flat vowels and the equal effortlessness of his scene-stealing.Sarge does not much care for Desmond. Neither does his commander, Captain Glover (Sam Worthington). Desmond’s refusal to bear arms strikes these officers as a potential threat to morale, and they try to get rid of him — encouraging the other soldiers to harass and beat him, trying to arrange a psychiatric discharge and finally convening a court-martial. This parade of indignities leads to scenes of quiet defiance; a few rousing, tear-streaked speeches; and a bit of mildly interesting philosophical reflection. Mr. Gibson is too impatient to linger over the nuances of patriotic duty and religious devotion. He and the screenwriters, Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, are content to remind us that both are very important. Then it’s time to get back to Okinawa and deal with the Japanese Army.Ever since “Saving Private Ryan,” Hollywood has been eager to revisit World War II, partly to explore gray areas and narrative corners neglected in earlier eras and partly to have a high-minded reason to try out advances in bloody special effects. Realism is less a principle than an excuse to concoct vivid fantasies of battle for the benefit of noncombatants, to rub our faces in details that our fathers and grandfathers were famously reluctant to discuss.And “Hacksaw Ridge” uses the moral dilemma of its hero — who is sometimes tempted to forsake his vows and pick up a rifle in the heat of battle — as a pretext for its own ethical sleight of hand. The film pretends to be a grim reckoning with the horrors of war, but it is also, true to its genre, a rousing celebration of the thrills of battle. Desmond Doss was calm, humble and courageous, qualities Mr. Gibson honors but does not share. It is possible to be moved and inspired by Desmond’s exploits while still feeling that his convictions have been exploited, perhaps even betrayed.“Hacksaw Ridge” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Blood, guts and period-appropriate racial slurs and tobacco use. Running time: 2 hours 11 minutes.",0,67115062.0,67209615.0,0

That is the vibe given off by “The Good Soldier,” a film whose benign-sounding title and Veterans Day release give a false impression of what it actually is: an attack on the military, drenched in blood.The filmmakers, Lexy Lovell and Michael Uys, profile five veterans from four wars — World War II, Vietnam and the two Iraq conflicts — who discuss what being a soldier did to them. In most cases it made them callous about killing, whether the targets were enemy soldiers or civilians.The men are starkly eloquent. “We had learned during the short period that we were there that anything in black pajamas was the enemy, so we opened fire on them,” Will Williams, a Vietnam veteran, says, recalling an encounter early in his tour when his unit mowed down some teenagers who might have been civilians. “Did I kill an innocent kid or was it a Cong? It’s a question that’s never answered.”These compelling stories, though, are accompanied by a barrage of graphic images of wartime death, shocking at first — which of course is the point — but eventually too much, to the point of ghoulishness.As for the overall approach, the five subjects are hardly representative of veterans. And their choice bespeaks lazy filmmaking. One, Edward W. Wood Jr., is a published author; others are vocal in peace groups. Mr. Uys and Ms. Lovell didn’t exactly have to look hard to find any of them.THE GOOD SOLDIEROpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Lexy Lovell and Michael Uys; director of photography, Samuel Henriques; edited by Sikay Tang; music by J J Grey; released by Artistic License Films.

SCOTT,Heroic Past Erodes in Present,"“The Debt,” John Madden’s remake of a 2007 Israeli thriller, shuttles back and forth between a dim, creaky East Berlin apartment in 1965 and the sunshine of elite Tel Aviv a little more than 30 years later. The film, written by Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Peter Straughan, is interested in the ways that the truth of the past can be shaded and illuminated by the imperatives of the present, and it probes, with perhaps more energy than clarity, the ethical and psychological complications that can lie hidden beneath a story of simple heroism.In this case the official, heroic story has to do with what happened in cold war Berlin, where three Mossad operatives went on a secret mission to capture a Nazi fugitive named Dieter Vogel. Their daring, widely celebrated exploits become the subject of a book written in 1997 by Sarah Gold (Romi Aboulafia), the daughter of two of the agents: Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren) and her ex-husband, Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson). Rachel, particularly, has been lionized for the courage she displayed in her younger days. She not only had the nerve to entrap her diabolical quarry, a Mengele-like doctor whose gruesome nickname was the Surgeon of Birkenau, but she also had the presence of mind to shoot him dead when he tried to escape.All of this is shown early in the film; I’m not spoiling anything. But gradually, through revisionist flashbacks and tense, elliptical conversations, the accepted account of Rachel’s actions begins to erode. The third member of the team, David (Ciaran Hinds), shows up, and his anguished demeanor and alarming actions are the first signs of serious trouble. So back we go, and then forward, through the turns of an absorbing, sometimes improbable narrative of guilty secrets and unintended consequences.In Berlin David is played by Sam Worthington, Stephan by Marton Csokas and Rachel by Jessica Chastain. Ms. Chastain, this year’s officially designated emerging movie star, seems a bit too delicate to take down a war criminal or to grow up into the regal, world-weary Helen Mirren, but her exquisite sensitivity nonetheless provides “The Debt” with its emotional center of gravity.Rachel’s colleagues present neatly contrasting temperaments. David is melancholy and introspective — haunted by the wartime death of his parents — while Stephan is rakish, ambitious and cynical. A tense, triangular workplace romance takes shape, as Rachel negotiates her ambivalent attraction to both men and their much less ambivalent attraction to her. The one she falls in love with may not be the one she ends up with.Matters become even more complicated when the carefully planned kidnapping of Vogel (Jesper Christensen) goes awry, and he becomes a prisoner in the apartment. Earlier, under a false name, he had been Rachel’s gynecologist — she posed as a patient to pierce his cover — and this history produces a queasy intimacy between them that he tries to exploit to gain her sympathy. Rachel and David are so earnest and idealistic that standing guard over this embodiment of evil, feeding him and enduring his anti-Semitic taunts, seems to put their souls in peril. Three decades later his memory haunts them like a curse.Or maybe it is their own guilt, or the effects of a hidden truth they have worked hard to repress. As “The Debt” grows more complex and suspenseful, it also becomes more literal, losing some of its dramatic intensity. The claustrophobic, unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel, David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents, and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller.Not a bad one, it should be said. Mr. Madden’s knack for swift and intricate drama has shown itself before in films as varied as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Proof,” but those movies also show the tendency toward glibness that undermines “The Debt.” Vogel’s confinement in the Mossad agents’ apartment is the result of an airtight plan disrupted by chance, human fallibility and the sheer messiness of experience. But that is precisely what the film, with its narrowly construed range of ethical choices and emotional conundrums, works to exclude. It errs, if anything, on the side of professionalism, turning a tale full of sticky political implications and emotional undercurrents into a neat sequence of plot twists.While the two Rachels don’t quite seem to be the same person (in spite of carefully matched scars on their cheeks), they are both, in their different ways, captivating: Ms. Chastain for her expressiveness and Ms. Mirren for her stoicism. The men are all simpler, more boldly drawn creatures, but the actors do their jobs with efficiency and conviction, and the dashing Mr. Csokas supplies otherwise missing elements of humor and sex.The labors of the cast help to make “The Debt” a compact, reasonably clever and sometimes piquant entertainment, but they also make you aware that it could have been more.“The Debt” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has bloody violence, angry swearing and some uncomfortable sexual situations.",0,31146570.0,31177548.0,0

To the film’s 70-something protagonist, Lenny Sugarman (Dominic Chianese), places like Eisenberg’s Coffee-Sandwich Shop, at 174 Fifth Avenue; Moulded Shoe Company, at 10 East 39th Street; and Global International Mens Clothing, at 62 Orchard Street, are lingering vestiges of the less impersonal city of his youth, or so he imagines.Mr. Wang is a documentary photographer whose book of portraits, “Harvey Wang’s New York” (Norton), showing older blue-collar New Yorkers in their humble workplaces, gives  the dwindling Manhattan population of trade workers and artisans a poignant human face.But in today’s cold, modern Manhattan with its corporate towers, “nobody cares for nobody,” Lenny complains to his unhappily married best friend, Ruben Liebner (Dick Latessa, playing an Art Carney-like sidekick). “It ain’t exactly front page,” he grouses, “but it’s getting crueler. Can you feel it?”The best thing about this tiny independent film is its evocation of the relentless speed with which the city tears down and rebuilds itself, driving out older, less affluent residents like Lenny and Ruben. Lenny, a lifelong bachelor with a one-room apartment in Brooklyn, is a stubborn fool and unlikable loudmouth, although Mr. Chianese brings out the heartbreaking loneliness under his curmudgeonly grandiosity.Early in the film, Lenny’s nephew Zach (Josh Hamilton), a successful stockbroker, informs Lenny that he is broke. Instead of taking Zach’s financial advice, Lenny has relied on hunches and sidewalk stock tips to invest his money and has lost everything. He becomes so depressed that he decides to commit suicide. A phone call from Mimi (Kathleen Chalfant), a gracious woman he meets by chance on a bus, interrupts his attempt to hang himself from a noose made of neckties.Suddenly Lenny is manic with hope. For his first date with Mimi, he spends his last remaining dollars on an $1,100 suit, fancy shoes and gifts. With Ruben in tow, he poses as a stockbroker and persuades the elderly proprietors of a jewelry shop to give him $5,000 to invest, promising them a 28 percent yearly return.“The Last New Yorker” would like to think of itself as a comic fairy tale, but Lenny’s pride and self-delusion are too pathetic to be amusing. Lenny resists Ruben’s plea to leave the city with him and retire to a trailer on the Gulf of Mexico. The biggest of many enormous holes in the story is the movie’s refusal to fill in Lenny’s background. The scenes of his courtship of Mimi, an elegant retired department-store buyer, will make you wince as he plies her with compliments and gifts like a besotted schoolboy, and she responds with tact and compassion.Why this radiant, kind woman would put up with such a childish, deceitful deadbeat for more than five minutes remains a mystery; she must be an angel.The Last New YorkerOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Harvey Wang; written byAdam Forgash; director of photography,Derek McKane; edited by Jeff Flohr; musicby Dario Eskenazi; production designer,Tamar Gadish; produced by DannyVinik and Mr. Forgash; released byBrink Film.

333,2011-06-08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:13,MIKE HALE,Living a Drug Life in a World of Snow,"The title of Joonas Neuvonen’s “Reindeerspotting: Escape From Santaland” makes explicit the film’s premise: to take the kind of intimacy and immediacy Danny Boyle achieved in his fictional story of Glasgow heroin addicts, “Trainspotting,” and apply it to a documentary about Mr. Neuvonen’s fellow drug users in northern Finland.Mission accomplished. “Reindeerspotting,” primarily a portrait of an effervescent, smart and terribly sad young addict and thief named Jani, puts us right in the room — and the toilet stall, and the stolen car, and the fleabag hotel. Questions of the filmmaker’s role are moot, given Mr. Neuvonen’s literal complicity in his friends’ lives and misdeeds. He does draw a line when he’s asked to hold the stereo Jani is trying to detach from a dashboard, but he may have just needed both hands for the camera.Filming in 2003 (the movie was eventually completed by a Helsinki production house), Mr. Neuvonen captures amazing moments — burglaries in progress, a stoned friend tumbling several stories from a balcony to the sidewalk — and a coherent story emerges about Jani’s downward spiral, though it’s jumpy and episodic, stitched together with intertitles.It’s also a pretty familiar story, and “Reindeer,” despite Mr. Neuvonen’s verve and Jani’s charisma, can drag. Like a lot of addiction stories, it starts to mirror the monotony and self-absorption of the addict’s life. What saves it, finally, are Mr. Neuvonen’s instinctive, and considerable, skills as an image maker: long after you forget Jani’s story, you’ll remember the way the snowy landscapes look, and the surreal beauty of a nighttime reindeer race.Reindeerspotting: Escape From SantalandOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.

Yet it has a heart, too, and that adds a surprising amount of emotion to this above-average science-fiction film.Set in the past, present and future, all story lines center on Marc (Tom Hughes). His life is charted from his first breath (the movie’s opening shows an actual birth, up close) through scenes of his childhood before moving to a time near today, when he’s diagnosed with terminal cancer.Marc decides to cryo-freeze his body in hopes of later being cured, leading to his reanimation — or rebirth, if you will — in 2084. It’s no surprise that his plans have unexpected consequences.Mateo Gil, the writer and director, prizes ideas as much as action. Voice-overs have Marc expounding on memory, longing and mortality while the script probes the side effects of technology. The future scenes evoke the creepiness and claustrophobia of “Ex Machina” and, like that film, hark back to the “Frankenstein” story.The romance at the center of “Realive” keeps it from becoming too cold. Marc’s girlfriend, Naomi (Oona Chaplin), struggles with losing him, while Elizabeth (Charlotte Le Bon), his nurse in 2084, has affections and worries of her own. A montage recalling Marc and Naomi’s on-again, off-again relationship is one of several lovely moments from the exceptional cast.“Realive” occasionally sets a cautious pace, and the voice-overs can be wordy. But this film errs on the side of ambition, making such faults easy to excuse. For sure, Mr. Gil and his cast are exploring something here, and those efforts are well worth watching.",0,,,0
335,2015-11-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:23,RACHEL SALTZ,"Review: ‘Prem Ratan Dhan Payo,’ a Bollywood Tale of a Prince-and-Plebe Double","The Bollywood movie “Prem Ratan Dhan Payo” is set in contemporary India, though it’s one of palaces and quaint villages and low-rise cities, with the occasional iPhone and Mercedes thrown in for modernity and luxury branding’s sake.A fantasy about princes and princesses and perfect doubles, the story’s roots are as firmly planted in Hindu myth and epic as in Bollywood romance. We first see our hero, Prem (Salman Khan), a sweetie-pie actor, in a Ramlila, a play about Rama and Sita, the royal husband and wife whose tale is told in the Ramayana.Later, Prem (his name means “love”) impersonates a real prince (Mr. Khan again), a haughtier fellow who has been wounded in a foul-play horse-and-carriage accident and has then hidden in a cave to recover. And the Bollywood plot thickens: The prince is kidnapped and chained to a post in a sheesh mahal, or palace of mirrors, only to be rescued by Prem, their images multiplied in fun-house confusion. Through decency and playfulness, Prem brings peace to the warring parties of the royal family and snags the love of a princess (Sonam Kapoor) to boot.With its full complement of lavishly produced song-and-dance numbers, its filmi heroes and villains, and a two-hour, 40-minute runtime, “Prem” hews closely to the old-style Bollywood formula. At one point, the prince’s wayward brother plants his legs apart, swigs imported champagne from a bottle and shrieks “Freedom!” while the camera gazes up at him from below. (File under: “Villain, temporarily triumphant.”) In other words, the director, Sooraj R. Barjatya, courts and embraces cliché at every turn, which is both the movie’s charm and its limitation.At 49, Mr. Khan, in the double role of nice guy/sophisticated prince — Bollywood loves a double! — has shed some of his boyish twinkle, gained a rap sheet and overbulked his upper body. His dancing can feel leaden and his movie-star allure has dimmed.

The film is interested not in the heart of Lee’s career — he pitched for Boston and Montreal from 1969 to 1982 — but in the end of it, and the slow process of letting go of the glory days.That makes this a different sort of baseball movie, one in which not much baseball is played. The effort is commendable, but the execution is rocky.Josh Duhamel portrays Lee, who had some good years in the majors but also had a contempt for authority that left him unloved by management. As we meet him, he is being shown the door by the Montreal Expos. He’s confident he’ll get another job offer, but his reputation in the league has poisoned his prospects, a realization that is a long time in coming.Many fans admired Lee for his brash fearlessness (he’s now a candidate for governor of Vermont), but the man we meet in this film isn’t particularly likable or charming, just annoying and self-destructive. The movie isn’t helped by occasional voice-overs by the main character, whose chirpiness in them is at odds with the sour fellow we’re seeing onscreen.The director, Brett Rapkin, has also made a documentary about Lee (“Spaceman: A Baseball Odyssey,” 2006) that focused on his post-major-league career, so he’s obviously fascinated with the guy. But here, intentionally or not, he deflates the Lee legend. This pitcher, like a lot of athletes, may never have been as compelling as the spotlight made him appear.NEIL GENZLINGER“Spaceman” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language, drug use and shots of Mr. Duhamel in his underwear or less.",0,,,1

I suppose even a homophobic womb is better than none.This particular womb belongs to Miranda (A. J. Cook), a Georgia baker broodily seeking to replace the child she lost five years earlier. Miranda’s sister (Sarah Carter) has already “adopted” a surplus embryo from a fertility clinic; so when Miranda’s husband fails to uphold his end of the procreation bargain, a news item on television about a gay couple’s search for a surrogate convinces her that God has spoken. Soon, cross-shaped cookies aren’t the only treats in her oven.Then Terry (Orlando Jones), an African-American choreographer and one of the expectant fathers, arrives from Boston sporting a white suit and a “Swan Lake” ring tone. The ensuing culture clash (quick, hide the antigay banners!) unfolds as a ham-fisted medley of bad writing (by the director, Ron Satlof, and Ira Pearlstein) and good intentions.Spiked with phobic silliness — Miranda suffers a panic attack at the sight of Terry’s ornate Boston bedroom — “Misconceptions” is an asinine pileup of improbabilities.

The exact meanings may get lost in translation, but trite is a universal language apparently.Vincent (Florian David Fitz, who also wrote the screenplay) is a sensitive 27-year-old recluse with Tourette’s syndrome. His alcoholic mother has just died from cirrhosis, and his estranged father (Heino Ferch), a callous politician, has him committed to a psychiatric clinic so as not to disrupt the re-election campaign. But Vincent soon breaks out, and joined by an acerbic anorexic (Karoline Herfurth) and a neurotically fastidious obsessive-compulsive (Johannes Allmayer), he embarks on a quest to fulfill his mother’s final wish that her ashes be scattered over the Italian sea.Sounds pretty bleak. But don’t worry: every downbeat is pillowed in soft rock and gentle humor, every Ricola-commercial mountainscape is graced by colorful lens flares and rolling fog, and every clinical disorder is just an unredeemed ticket to self-realization. The principal characters can be reduced to a handful of tics, and the entire story line is immaculately devoid of incidental detail. It’s like sitting in a padded cell for about 90 minutes.That this film took the best-picture and actor prizes at this year’s German Film Awards is enough to make anyone a true believer in Hollywood.VINCENT WANTS TO SEAOpened on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Ralf Huettner; written by Florian David Fitz; director of photography, Andreas Berger; edited by Kai Schroeter; music by Stevie B-Zet and Ralf Hildenbeutel; art direction by Heidi Lüdi; costumes by Natascha Curtius-Noss; produced by Viola Jäger and Harald Kügler; released by Corinth Films.

The movie, adapted by Richard Curtis from Andy Mulligan’s 2010 novel, is a hyperkinetic juvenile thriller set in and around a Rio de Janeiro slum. The grimy splendor of the dump where the boys spend their days scavenging is so colorful that its contents look almost edible. These plucky lads think nothing of diving into the brown polluted water of its adjoining lake.“Trash” is a shameless bid to recycle the mystique of “Slumdog Millionaire,” its likable, overrated prototype. I have a vision of well-heeled American audience members settling back in their seats, breathing a collective sigh of comfort while digging into their popcorn and thinking “Awww, aren’t they sweet!” while disregarding the harsh reality behind this fairy tale. Doesn’t everybody love angels with dirty faces?Mr. Daldry is no slouch when it comes to directing mischievous adolescents, having made his directorial feature film debut with “Billy Elliot” and then gone on to oversee its Broadway musical incarnation. “Trash” appears readymade for a similar theatrical transmutation. Like its opulent visuals, the soundtrack — a propulsive hybrid of samba, Brazilian hip-hop and Hollywood lushness — is a bit too much of a good thing.ImageCreditJoseph Anthony Lawrence/Focus WorldThis fantasy adventure begins with a police raid in which José Angelo (Wagner Moura), a virtuous grown-up tattletale, is tortured and killed by cops in the pay of a corrupt mayoral candidate. Before his capture, he tosses his wallet into a garbage truck, whose contents land in the dump where Rafael (Rickson Tévis), one of the boys, finds it. He shares the cash with his pals Gardo (Eduardo Luís) and Ráto (Gabriel Weinstein), a.k.a. Rat, who discovers a key that opens a downtown locker in which they find a piece of paper scrawled with a code.In a harebrained film that makes as much sense as the “National Treasure” movies, the boys find themselves running for their lives with swarms of goons in pursuit. Not only acrobats but also little geniuses who outwit and outrun their enemies, they crack the code, rooted in the Bible, to reveal the candidate’s dirty dealings. Sandwiched between action scenes are videos made by the boys in which they speak directly to the camera.In the movie’s weakest sections, a chubby American priest (Martin Sheen) who works with the poor helps them, while mouthing nonsensical platitudes like “Don’t waste your life fighting battles that make you bitter or make you dead.” His assistant, Olivia (Rooney Mara, in a wispy role), has little to do but look pretty and help the boys in a weepy subplot that barely gets off the ground before it’s abandoned. “Trash” has more than its share of religious hokum: anything that might conceivably squeeze out an extra tear or sigh.

Given that he’s played by Bryan Cranston (“Breaking Bad”), you have hopes that Trumbo will soon be making like Errol Flynn and dashing and slashing through the movie, giving it verve, excitement. The real Trumbo (1905-1976) was a pistol. A baker-intellectual turned industry insider, he was funny, barbed and wildly prolific, with screen credits that range from “Kitty Foyle” to “Spartacus.” He was also a Communist, which for many made him a traitor, the Devil, no more than a terrorist.Part biopic, part historical gloss, “Trumbo” tells a great-man story with a patchwork of fact and fiction, mixing in the odd bit of newsreel with a great many dull, visually flat and poorly lighted dramatic scenes. Written by John McNamara and directed by Jay Roach, it opens in 1947 in Los Angeles, where, in between shouts of “Action!” and “Cut!” and the usual wheeling and dealing, Hollywood is coming under siege. That was the year that the House Un-American Activities Committee held hearings in both Los Angeles and Washington to look into Communist doings. Witnesses were summoned, including the famed Hollywood 10 — Trumbo among them — who refused to testify, were deemed “unfriendly,” cited for contempt of Congress, fined, sentenced and jailed.This is the backdrop for the movie, which routinely casts an eye at the big political picture but prefers to narrow in on the more personal story of Trumbo’s struggles at home and at work. To that end there’s the domestic soap involving his loyal, loving, blandly conceived wife, Cleo (Diane Lane), and their three children. Oddly, the eldest, Niki (Madison Wolfe plays her until Elle Fanning steps in), ends up having more narrative and emotional weight than Cleo. Niki’s prominence smacks of a screenwriting contrivance, mostly as a way to paint Trumbo as someone who remained a loving family man despite his ordeals, but too often when he explains stuff to his daughter (Dad, are you a Communist?) the filmmakers are obviously explaining stuff to the audience.It’s rotten when a movie for grown-ups talks to its audience as if it were a child. Then again, with its wall-to-wall caricatures, its bellowing and mugging (including from Mr. Cranston) and historical reductivism, “Trumbo” sometimes evokes an old Looney Tunes sendup of Tinsel Town, though without the beauty, wit, visual style or economy. Some of the bellowers offer welcome relief, notably John Goodman as Frank King, one of the B-movie independents, who with his brother Hymie (Stephen Root) gives Trumbo work when the establishment refuses to. Mr. Goodman gooses the movie to life, as does Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper, the gossip queen who here, ridiculously, becomes the embodiment of everything that stinks in Hollywood, never mind the titans who ran it.It’s impossible to tell if the filmmakers don’t trust the audience or simply don’t have the chops, guts or heart to do this story justice. The blacklist remains vital and lamentably topical, and it’s clear why someone thought it was a good time to pull Trumbo back into the limelight. But the man who helped give us “Gun Crazy,” an American masterpiece, among many other titles, deserves a smarter portrait. The movie doesn’t just dumb down history, it also elides and slides over critical milestones, both personal and public, as well as the complex ideological divides that turned friends into enemies. Its Trumbo is a charmer who wears his contradictions so lightly you might not notice them, despite the occasional ribbing from his friends. You have to wonder if the real Trumbo would recognize him.“Trumbo” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual references.

He has even been credited with inventing the concept of the midnight movie at Chelsea’s long-gone Elgin Theater, which he ran. Alas, the self-financed “Alina,” his first fiction feature as a director, looks like the work of someone just starting out.This fish-out-of-water story goes to predictable places in unconvincing ways. Alina (Darya Ekamasova), a Russian with a passion for photography, travels to New York seeking her father, whom she’s never met. (Not wanting to alarm her mother, she pretends she’s going to Cuba.)Alina soon discovers the city is full of sharks. She moves in with an old friend (Anna Vlads) and her two roommates, not realizing that when they bring her to a party, they expect her to have sex with the rich hosts. When she goes to work for a nightclub owner (Grisha Reydler) who has helped with her search, she is slow to realize that the job involves more than serving champagne.Although the internet and cellphones exist in the movie, there’s a dated quality to the premise. Even if Alina’s only clue is an old photograph of a man who may be her father, tracking down the owners of the building in the photo — which has a visible address — seems like a task for search engines. And if you were to go the route of simply finding someone who knows someone, repeatedly, as Alina does, it would probably involve less coincidence.",0,,,0
342,2009-12-18,Avatar,"Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang","UK, USA",James Cameron,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","English, Spanish",83.0,162.0,James Cameron,2009,7.8,1003716.0,82.0,2017-11-02 04:18:10,MANOHLA DARGIS,"A New Eden, Both Cosmic and Cinematic","With “Avatar” James Cameron has turned one man’s dream of the movies into a trippy joy ride about the end of life — our moviegoing life included — as we know it. Several decades in the dreaming and more than four years in the actual making, the movie is a song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an Emersonian exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with Cameronian rock ’em, sock ’em pulpy action. Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the movie — one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump — is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged.The story behind the story, including a production budget estimated to top $230 million, and Mr. Cameron’s future-shock ambitions for the medium have already begun to settle into myth (a process partly driven by the publicity, certainly). Every filmmaker is something of a visionary, just by virtue of the medium. But Mr. Cameron, who directed the megamelodrama “Titanic” and, more notably, several of the most influential science-fiction films of the past few decades (“The Terminator,” “Aliens” and “The Abyss”), is a filmmaker whose ambitions transcend a single movie or mere stories to embrace cinema as an art, as a social experience and a shamanistic ritual, one still capable of producing the big  WOW.The scale of his new movie, which brings you into a meticulous and brilliantly colored alien world for a fast 2 hours 46 minutes, factors into that wow. Its scope is evident in an early scene on a spaceship (the year is 2154), where the passengers, including a paraplegic ex-Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington, a gruffly sensitive heartthrob), are being roused from a yearslong sleep before landing on a distant inhabited moon, Pandora. Jake is woken by an attendant floating in zero gravity, one of many such aides. As Jake himself glides  through the bright cavernous space, you know you’re not in Kansas anymore, as someone soon quips (a nod to “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Cameron’s favorite film). You also know you’re not in the gloom of “The Matrix.”Though it’s easy to pigeonhole Mr. Cameron as a gear head who’s more interested in cool tools (which here include 3-D), he is, with “Avatar,” also making a credible attempt to create a paradigm shift in science-fiction cinema. Since it was first released in 1999, “The Matrix,” which owes a large debt to Mr. Cameron’s own science-fiction films as well as the literary subgenre of cyberpunk, has hung heavily over both SF and action filmmaking. Most films that crib from “The Matrix” tend to borrow only its slo-mo death waltzes and leather fetishism, keeping its nihilism while ditching the intellectual inquiries. Although “Avatar” delivers a late kick to the gut that might be seen as nihilistic (and how!), it is strangely utopian.It doesn’t take Jake long to feel the good vibes. Like Neo, the savior-hero of the “Matrix” series played by Keanu Reeves, Jake is himself an avatar because he’s both a special being and an embodiment of an idea, namely that of the hero’s journey. What initially makes Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part-alien, part-human body that he controls, like a puppeteer, from its head to its prehensile tail. Like the rest of the human visitors who’ve made camp on Pandora, he has signed on with a corporation that’s intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium, a great whatsit  that is an emblem of humanity’s greed and folly. With his avatar, Jake will look just like one of the natives, the Na’vi, a new identity that gives the movie its plot turns and politics.The first part of Jake’s voyage — for this is, above all, a boy’s rocking adventure, if one populated by the usual tough Cameron chicks — takes him from a wheelchair into a 10-foot, blue-skinned Na’vi body. At once familiar and pleasingly exotic, the humanoid Na’vi come with supermodel dimensions (slender hips, a miniature-apple rear); long articulated digits, the better to grip with; and the slanted eyes and twitchy ears of a cat. (The gently curved stripes that line their blue skin, the color of twilight, bring to mind the markings on mackerel tabby cats.) For Jake his avatar, which he hooks into through sensors while lying in a remote pod in a semiconscious state, is at first a giddy novelty and then a means to liberation.Plugging into the avatar gives Jake an instant high, allowing him to run, leap and sift dirt through his toes, and freeing him from the constraints of his body. Although physically emancipated, he remains bound, contractually and existentially, to the base camp, where he works for the corporation’s top scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, amused and amusing), even while taking orders from its head of security, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a military man turned warrior for hire. A cartoon of masculinity, Quaritch strides around barking orders like some intransigent representation of American military might (or a bossy movie director). It’s a favorite Cameron type, and Mr. Lang, who until this year had long been grievously underemployed, tears into the role like a starved man gorging on steak.Mr. Cameron lays out the fundamentals of the narrative efficiently, grabbing you at once with one eye-popping detail after another and on occasion almost losing you with some of the comically broad dialogue. He’s a masterly storyteller if a rather less nimble prose writer. (He has sole script credit: this is personal filmmaking on an industrial scale.) Some of the clunkier lines (“Yeah, who’s bad,” Jake taunts a rhinolike creature he encounters) seem to have been written to placate those members of the Michael Bay demographic who might find themselves squirming at the story’s touchier, feelier elements, its ardent environmentalism and sincere love story, all of which kick in once Jake meets Neytiri, a female Na’vi (Zoë Saldana, seen only in slinky Na’vi form).Mr. Cameron has said that he started thinking about the alien universe that became Pandora and its galactic environs in “Avatar” back in the 1970s. He wrote a treatment in 1996, but the technologies he needed to turn his ideas into images didn’t exist until recently. New digital technologies gave him the necessary tools, including performance capture, which translates an actor’s physical movements into a computer-generated image (CGI). Until now, by far the most plausible character created in this manner has been slithery Gollum from Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” cycle. The exotic creatures in “Avatar,” which include an astonishment of undulating, flying, twitching and galloping organisms, don’t just crawl through the underbrush;  they thunder and shriek, yip and hiss, pointy teeth gleaming.The most important of these are the Na’vi, and while their movements can bring to mind old-fashioned stop-motion animation, their faces are a triumph of tech innovation, with tremors and twitches that make them immediately appealing and empathetic. By the time Neytiri ushers Jake into her world of wonders — a lush dreamscape filled with kaleidoscopic and bioluminescent flora and fauna, with pink jellyfishlike creatures that hang in the air and pleated orange flowers that snap shut like parasols — you are deep in the Na’vi-land. It’s a world that looks as if it had been created by someone who’s watched a lot of Jacques Cousteau television or, like Mr. Cameron, done a lot of diving. It’s also familiar because, like John Smith in “The New World,” Terrence Malick’s retelling of the Pocahontas story, Jake has discovered Eden.An Eden in three dimensions, that is. In keeping with his maximalist tendencies, Mr. Cameron has shot “Avatar” in 3-D (because many theaters are not equipped to show 3-D, the movie will also be shown  in the usual 2), an experiment that serves his material beautifully. This isn’t the 3-D of the 1950s or even contemporary films, those flicks that try to give you a virtual poke in the eye with flying spears. Rather Mr. Cameron uses 3-D to amplify the immersive experience of spectacle cinema. Instead of bringing you into the movie with the customary tricks, with a widescreen or even Imax image filled with sweeping landscapes and big action, he uses 3-D  seemingly to close the space between the audience and the screen. He brings the movie to you.After a few minutes the novelty of people and objects hovering above the row in front of you wears off, and you tend not to notice the 3-D, which speaks to the subtlety of its use and potential future applications. Mr. Cameron might like to play with high-tech gadgets, but he’s an old-fashioned filmmaker at heart, and he wants us to get as lost in his fictional paradise as Jake eventually does. On the face of it there might seem something absurd about a movie that asks you to thrill to a natural world made almost entirely out of zeroes and ones (and that feeds you an anticorporate line in a corporately financed entertainment). But one of the pleasures of the movies is that  they transport us, as Neytiri does with Jake, into imaginary realms, into Eden and over the rainbow to Oz.If the story of a paradise found and potentially lost feels resonant, it’s because “Avatar” is as much about our Earth as the universe that Mr. Cameron has invented. But the movie’s truer meaning is in the audacity of its filmmaking.Few films return us to the lost world of our first cinematic experiences, to that magical moment when movies really were bigger than life (instead of iPhone size), if only because we were children. Movies rarely carry us away, few even try. They entertain and instruct and sometimes enlighten. Some attempt to overwhelm us, but their efforts are usually a matter of volume. What’s often missing is awe, something Mr. Cameron has, after an absence from Hollywood, returned to the screen with a vengeance. He hasn’t changed cinema, but with blue people and pink blooms he has confirmed its wonder.“Avatar” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Once the public has warmed to a specific persona, it can fiercely resist any dismantling of the illusion — which is why Steve Carell’s movie characters shrewdly retain the essence of his alter ego from “The Office,” Michael Scott.In “A Little Help” Mr. Carell’s television co-star Jenna Fischer plays Laura, a Long Island dental hygienist whose life is less than satisfying. Her husband (Chris O’Donnell) may be straying; her 12-year-old son (Daniel Yelsky) sulks; and her mother and sister (Lesley Ann Warren and Brooke Smith) are controlling witches. No wonder those cans of Budweiser are so soothing.Set in the summer of 2002, and with 9/11 providing a major plot point, “A Little Help” (written and directed by the veteran television writer Michael J. Weithorn) is an engaging dramedy that allows its star room to stretch. When a sudden death spurs further deterioration of Laura’s ability to cope, Ms. Fischer makes her emotional flailing messily relatable. And though the enjoyable prickliness of the film’s early scenes soon dissolves into cozy solutions, a sturdy supporting cast — even Ron Leibman’s scenery-chewing turn as Laura’s blowhard father is more amusing than annoying — balances the scales.Adding heft is a beautifully ambivalent performance by Rob Benedict as Laura’s wistful brother-in-law, Paul. Buoyed by an easy, natural chemistry, Paul’s scenes with Laura are exceptionally touching, the sadness of the road not taken easily eclipsing the chaos of the path at hand.“A Little Help” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

His last film, “Rajneeti,” a sort of “Mahabharata” meets “The Godfather,” set in present-day Bhopal, was about corruption in a dynastic ruling family. Here he grapples with caste prejudice and the Indian version of affirmative action: the reserving of spots in schools for low or “backward” castes. (“Aarakshan” means reservation.)To help tell his big story, he has enlisted Bollywood’s Mr. Big, Amitabh Bachchan, who plays Prabhakar Anand, a Bhopal college principal whose integrity costs him his job. Among his protégés is the low-caste Deepak (Saif Ali Khan).“Tell us about your father,” job interviewers demand of Deepak in the opening scene. Yet even as the film works to overturn the idea that family status determines worth, it can’t help placing its hopes in a good daddy figure: namely, Mr. Bachchan’s Prabhakar, who looms as large to his students as the man who plays him does to generations of Indian moviegoers.At times “Aarakshan” comes off like a pep rally for pluralism and inclusion. (“Just give me a chance and watch me take flight” go the lyrics to one song.) But Mr. Jha doesn’t stint on the melodrama, unabashedly pitting smirking corruption against heroic rectitude.

In “Film Ist. a Girl & a Gun,” the Austrian director Gustav Deutsch complicates this witty, deceptively simple formula with a wealth of found footage (material shot by others for other purposes) borrowed from film archives from around the world. As the title suggests, there are girls (voluptuous, ecstatic, threatened)   and there are guns  (hard, phallic, threatening)  along with something of a narrative.If the narrative that Mr. Deutsch has created is rather less thrilling than his mostly silent and often glorious images, this is nonetheless a story well worth considering, and watching. Using material gathered from   the likes of  the Imperial War Museum (in Britain) and the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction (at Indiana University), he has fashioned something of an origin story about cinema itself. It’s a tale that begins with an unidentified image of a woman in buckskin shooting at  some targets and ends with a cowboy bandit pointing his gun at the camera, an image appropriated from Edwin S. Porter’s 1903 short, “The Great Train Robbery,” one of the most famous in cinema history. Tucked between these loaded images, as it were, is a vision of cinematic paradise, found and lost.Tumult of a kind pursues the shooting woman (nothing new there) in the form of a mesmerizing, mysterious shot of what looks like an archery target in flames and some text (“at the first Chaos came to be”)  from “Theogony,” an epic Greek poem by Hesiod about the origin of the world. The archery target gives way to fiery orange images of billowing smoke and some electronic thrumming. (The intermittent score tends to underscore the obvious.) The thrumming turns to droning, the smoke turns to lava, followed by more Hesiod (“wide-bosomed earth”), a woman with bountiful breasts, “Paradeisos” (Greek for paradise) and naked beachfront frolickers.It is, as you might guess, all downhill from there, at least on one level. Cinematically, however, there are more delights to come. In addition to being an estimable “archaeologist of the cinema,” to borrow a nice description from the Austrian critic Stefan Grissemann, Mr. Deutsch is a crackerjack editor. In the next section, “Eros,” for instance, he intercuts images of a muscleman curling and uncurling his arms with time-lapse images of blooming flowers, underlining the sensuous similarities between the different motions. But because he is constructing a story, he then slips an image of a woman into the mix, which adds a suggestion of drama (what’s she doing here?) to what had been an elegant visual comparison between man and flower.Women turn out to be the fly in the ointment in “a Girl & a Gun.” (“Dead flies cause the ointment of   the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor” or so it says in Ecclesiastes.) Among the many images that follow, many beautifully and floridly tinted, are sleeping, dreaming and fornicating clothed and unclothed women. In one early section, a woman drowsing in a steam room  seems to dream of  both an undulating jellyfish and a swimming man. In another section, a woman watches a  man spin four strange dials hidden behind a  cabinet,   as if he were initiating her into a secret world. (On the soundtrack, you hear “she dies.”) A world,  a subsequent  shot suggests  — of a woman reading a newspaper with the  headline “Cine Monde”  — that has been made   from images.“A Girl & a Gun”  — “Film Ist” is German for “Film Is”  — is the third in Mr. Deutsch’s evolving series that began with “Film Ist. (1-6),” which was created largely from scientific images, and continued with “Film Ist. (7-12),” stitched together from early  cinema gags and tricks.  (These  will be shown at Anthology Film Archives in New York, in conjunction with the theatrical run of “a Girl & a Gun.”) Part of the pleasure of the first sections is their relative straightforwardness, particularly “1-6,” which, through  artfully edited visual splendors  —  a talking skeleton, a walking cat, a spinning record  —  creates a graceful meditation on cinema as motion, as material, as perfection. With  “a Girl & a Gun,” Mr. Deutsch brings in Eros and Thanatos to a seductive if familiar end.FILM IST.

Crammed with performers who apparently didn’t read the script before signing on, the movie offends your intelligence on every level, starting with its use of Afghanistan as a Western playground. And it does so while trying to pump laughs from the threat of beheadings and honor killings alongside crude yuks about bedding Danielle Steel — questionable fodder made worse partly by some colossal bad timing: President Obama recently announced that American troops would remain, through 2017, in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has made a comeback and the so-called Islamic State is on the rise.Mitch Glazer wrote the script and Barry Levinson directed, and each presumably called in a few favors to fill out the cast. Bill Murray, who starred in “Scrooged,” co-written by Mr. Glazer, here plays Richie Lanz, a dead-ended music promoter and one of those putative lovable losers who are more adored by filmmakers than the rest of us. Marooned in a dusty corner of Los Angeles, Richie has a hot-cha-cha assistant who’s also an aspiring singer and is played by an ill-served Zooey Deschanel in raccoon eye makeup and animal-print leggings. One minute they’re wisecracking in La-La Land; the next they’re sweating in Kabul, set to entertain the troops. High jinks ensue.The filmmakers appear to be trying for the kind of comedy that infused “M*A*S*H” and, to a lesser extent, “Good Morning, Vietnam,” which Mr. Levinson directed. “Good Morning, Vietnam” centers on a disc jockey (played by Robin Williams) who is changed by his tenure in Vietnam; “M*A*S*H” zeroes in on doctors and nurses who, during the Korean War, keep insanity more or less at bay with gallows humor while up to their necks in battlefield blood. “Kasbah” isn’t remotely on the level of either; its laughs die mid-delivery, and there’s no sense that anyone is interested in what conflict does to the soul. In each of those earlier films, war has some kind of meaning.There’s nothing truly at stake for Richie, who first goofs around with some tired wartime types, including a smiley, servile local (Arian Moayed); a mercenary (Bruce Willis — what a waste!); a happy hooker (Kate Hudson); and two giddy, gonzo arms dealers (Scott Caan and Danny McBride). In time, Richie also sets off on an adventure that allows him to play the big hero-savior while earning a few bucks. His means to both is a Pashtun songbird, Salima (Leem Lubany), whom he places on a television competition, “Afghan Star” (a real show). Sure, her father and others disapprove of this public display by a young woman. But like many outsiders, Richie believes that he knows what Afghans really want — and, like this movie, he delivers imperialism with a smile.“Rock the Kasbah” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The song, with lyrics by Ghassen Amami and music by the eminent Iraqi oud player Khyam Allami, protests the repressive government of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia’s president for 23 years until he fled the country in 2011. It sets the tone of the film in which word of Farah’s dissenting voice reaches the authorities and her safety is endangered.The movie is a sympathetic portrait of the brash, foolhardy Farah, who lives with her fiercely protective mother, Hayet (Ghalia Benali), though she shares her daughter’s rebellious streak. But Hayet has lived long enough to witness the suppression of social upstarts in a religiously and socially conservative climate. With Farah about to enter medical school, Hayet frets that her promising future will be derailed if she continues provoking authority.Ms. Medhaffar has the charisma, if not the voice, of the young Joan Baez, and as Farah she performs with an anguished intensity as a member of Joujma, a fictional band created for the film.Farah’s boyfriend, Borhene (Montassar Ayari), who plays the lute, exudes a hipster’s cool. But even he is abashed by her bravado and her willingness to be seen drinking in public places that are traditionally male meeting spots. The two rendezvous in the bushes where they kiss but nothing more.Farah’s naïveté is punctured when a band member is revealed to be a government informer and angrily expelled from the group. Thereafter, an undertone of paranoia seeps through the movie. A distracting, unnecessary sequence about political unrest in the phosphate mines of Gafsa, the hub of the spontaneous uprising, is shoehorned into the film so abruptly it fails to resonate.“As I Open My Eyes” is best when it observes the fraught but loving mother-daughter relationship between Hayet and Farah. Farah is so single-minded in her pursuits that she can learn only from experience. And when the hard moment of truth arrives, she crumples.“As I Open My Eyes” is not rated.

The Riot Scene Needs Retakes.,"Love, death, cinema — they’re all there in “Mia Madre,” bumping up against one another beautifully. It’s the story of a movie director, Margherita (Margherita Buy), who, while shooting a difficult movie about labor strife, learns that her mother, Ada (Giulia Lazzarini), may be dying. Yet even as tragedy surges, flooding scenes and tear ducts, Margherita’s featured performer, an outsize American star named Barry (John Turturro), enters laughing, bellowing, acting. The Italian director Nanni Moretti knows how to turn on the waterworks, but he also knows about that burlesque called life.Mr. Moretti, whose films include “Dear Diary” and “We Have a Pope,” doesn’t draw a line between laughter and sorrow. Instead, he moves between registers and layers of emotion, slipping heavy moments into playful encounters and revealing the tender humor in an otherwise melancholic scene. In “Mia Madre,” he complicates the picture further by taking you on the set with Margherita while she’s shooting, and then mixing her production follies with her off-set experiences, memories and dreams. One moment, she is at a news conference, absent-mindedly gazing off; the next, she’s moving her hand across a shelf of her mother’s books only to shift abruptly back to the present.Ada is already in the hospital when the story begins. (Movingly played by Ms. Lazzarini, the character is based on Mr. Moretti’s own mother.) Initially, Margherita seems more concerned about her movie than about Ada’s health — or so it seems. Mr. Moretti isn’t a flashy visual stylist, but he’s a canny storyteller. “Mia Madre” opens on a tense scene of a group of striking workers squaring off against the riot police outside a factory gate. At that point, it isn’t clear that this is the movie Margherita is shooting, which serves Mr. Moretti’s meaning. Here, life and art blur, and, for better or worse, Margherita lives in that blur.The first time Margherita appears, she’s running over to the clashing protesters and police officers, a mass of churning action — truncheons, limbs, water hoses — that evokes one of those giant canvases depicting the massacre of the innocents. She calls cut and then calls out a camera operator, critiquing his approach. She doesn’t like the way he shot the riot; he insists that his way allows viewers to get “into” the scene. “I don’t want them into it,” Margherita replies, neatly delivering the first volley in Mr. Moretti’s enduring argument about leftism and representation. Later, she wonders of the camera operator, “Would he rather bash or get bashed?”That Mr. Moretti even asks what side do you want to be on — basher or bashed — raises that fundamental question, makes it evident what he thinks, how he himself answers it. Margherita may be increasingly plagued with doubts about her work — during that news conference, her voice-over gently mocks her own familiar pronouncements on “the task of cinema” — but Mr. Moretti frames her uncertainty as essential to both to creating art and to living life. It’s when Margherita is at her most arrogantly confident and dictatorial (directorial) that she’s at her absolute worse. That’s the case whether she’s yelling at her crew or, in a painful flashback, angrily ripping up her mother’s driver’s license, a gesture that is as sensible as it is cruel and humiliating.Mr. Moretti shifts among Margherita’s different states of consciousness — reveries and reminiscences — as fluidly as he peels back layers of emotion. He doesn’t announce these shifts; there are no mysterious fade-ins, no portentously twirling camerawork. Instead, Mr. Moretti bluntly cuts from states of awareness to something else, which means that you don’t immediately know if it’s a new day, a dream or a memory. In one such interlude, when Margherita walks along a line of people waiting to see Wim Wenders’s “Wings of Desire,” the crowd snaking around the block, it looks like an ordinary night until Margherita sees her mother and then sees her own younger self.Mr. Moretti, who has a supporting role as Margherita’s brother, plays with different performance styles throughout “Mia Madre,” with Ms. Lazzarini delivering a minimalist, naturalistic turn that pulls you in and Mr. Turturro going gloriously large and loud in a performance that seems calibrated to remind you that you’re watching a movie. Mr. Moretti’s visuals here tend to be matter-of-fact, borderline utilitarian, and so even when Margherita dreams, she remains tethered to the world. Her life, her mother and her movie are falling apart, but Margherita holds on, whether it’s that hand gently touching her mother’s books in the past or a chair, now empty, in the present.“Mia Madre” is not rated. It is in English and Italian, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes.",1,,,1
349,2008-08-01,The Wackness,"Ben Kingsley, Josh Peck, Famke Janssen, Olivia Thirlby","UK, USA",Jonathan Levine,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",English,61.0,99.0,Jonathan Levine,2008,7.0,28720.0,70.0,2017-11-02 04:18:08,A. O. SCOTT,"Summer of ’94, With Boy, Girl, Love and Dope Sales","For Luke Shapiro (Josh Peck) the summer of 1994 is a notably eventful time. In retrospect he will no doubt see it as the season when his life, as they say in the movies, changed forever. The movie  he is in, “The Wackness,” written and directed by Jonathan Levine, makes a good-faith effort to steer clear of such clichés, and succeeds and fails in roughly equal measure.To attempt a story like this — about a young man’s sexual initiation, heartbreak and disillusionment with the adult world that he is about to enter — is to sacrifice a degree of novelty. Mr. Levine tries to compensate with a combination of historical authenticity and low-key emotional sincerity.In the months between the end of high school and the start of college, a lot certainly happens to Luke, a shy, slack-jawed Upper East Sider who earns his pocket money by selling marijuana. His family is in danger of being evicted from its apartment. He spends a night in jail. The main thing, though, is that Luke falls in love with Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby), whose stepfather, Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley), is both Luke’s psychiatrist and one of his clients. (It’s a barter arrangement, one kind of therapy exchanged for another.)Stephanie is a popular girl, and Luke is a social misfit, but the main difference between them may be temperamental. She is a relatively optimistic, hedonistic soul, whereas he is a brooder and a worrier for whom the bong is always half empty. Or, as Stephanie puts it in a bit of dialogue that gives the film its title: “I look at the dopeness. You look at the wackness.”“The Wackness” has its share of both. The wack side is exemplified by Luke and Stephanie’s self-conscious use of mid-’90s hip-hop slang, a verbal tic matched by a few too many fetishistic period details. Did I mention that the movie takes place in 1994? If that all-important fact slips your mind, Mr. Levine will supply plenty of reminders, from the shell-toed Adidas sneakers on Luke’s feet to the dropped names of Kurt Cobain, Notorious B.I.G., Forrest Gump and Rudolph W. Giuliani. Those were the days, right? No doubt. But the fussed-over precision of the historical moment feels more like a gimmick than a source of insight, much as the dreamy haze cast over Manhattan by Petra Korner’s cinematography looks like a ready-made, one-size-fits-all cloak of nostalgia.But don’t think I’m forgetting the dopeness, which resides mainly in the idiosyncrasy of the characters and the skill of the actors portraying them. Lately Mr. Kingsley has been so busy as to seem indiscriminate, taking oddball roles in movies big and small, decent and dreadful — “BloodRayne”? “The Love Guru”? Sir Ben, really!Even in the lamest vehicle, however, he is almost always a delight to watch. Dr. Squires, by turns squirrelly reckless, with a less than firm grip on his marriage (to a dazed and tragic Famke Janssen), reality and the will to live, is perhaps the most preposterous character in “The Wackness,” and for just that reason the most intriguingly plausible. The doctor is, for his young patient and pot supplier, both a mentor and mascot. His evident untrustworthiness makes him the only grown-up in whom Luke has any faith.As gossip-minded readers may already know, Mr. Kingsley makes out with Mary-Kate Olsen, who in 1994, at the age of 8, was nearing the end of her run in “Full House.”  Her character here, a stoner named Union, is part of a supporting cast of eccentrics and urban curiosities — Method Man and Jane Adams are two more — who pleasantly divert “The Wackness” from its main narrative purpose.Not that the tentative, transient romance between Luke and Stephanie is without interest. Mr. Levine is careful not to overstate the melodrama of young love, allowing Luke’s own longing and confusion to set the tone. Mr. Peck, formerly a star of the Nickelodeon tweener sitcom “Drake and Josh,” works a little too hard to convey the tension between Luke’s outward affectlessness and the riot of feeling inside. He shows great seriousness and potential as an actor, but he also shows too much of what he has learned in acting class.Ms. Thirlby, meanwhile, who had a few nice scenes in “Juno,” does a fine job, as she did in “Snow Angels,” of playing the smart adolescent seductress of a teenage loner. I hope the angst mongers of the independent film world can find a leading role that will test her talents and show the full extent of her dopeness.“The Wackness” is rated R (Under 17 requires parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,She’s Almost 30 and Starting Over,"“Lola Versus” very much wants to be a funny, affectionate portrait of a young woman in crisis. As her 30th birthday approaches, Lola (Greta Gerwig), a graduate student living in New York, is dumped by her fiancé, Luke (Joel Kinnaman). The shock waves of this catastrophe reverberate through the rest of the movie, directed by Daryl Wein from a script he wrote with Zoe Lister-Jones.Mr. Wein and Ms. Lister-Jones, a couple in real life, previously collaborated on “Breaking Upwards” a fresh and honest look at the difficulties of sustaining a relationship in the post-post-sexual-revolution world. “Lola Versus,” unfortunately, is a dismayingly conventional exploration of the vicissitudes of romance. In spite of its scruffy look and slack pacing, it often rings as false as any of the big, shiny and soft studio rom-coms (starring Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl, say) of the last decade.Lola has — you guessed it — a wacky best friend, Alice (Ms. Lister-Jones), who bemoans her perpetually single state and is a walking anthology of semi-naughty quips, pop culture non-sequiturs and questionable behaviors. She spray tans. She takes OxyContin, mistaking it for oxytocin, which she thinks will be a shortcut to orgasm. It’s actually somehow less funny than it sounds.Lola’s other best friend is Henry (Hamish Linklater), a skinny, sensitive guy who plays in a band and who is also, awkwardly, good friends with Luke. Luke, meanwhile, is still sort of around, unwilling to let go of Lola entirely and thus feeding her longing to get back together with him.There are strong, complicated emotions implicit in the story, and Ms. Gerwig, with her guileless smarts and agreeable openness, makes a game effort at exploring them. She is good at crying, good at playing drunk, good at bad sex, and good at a lot of more particular things, like fidgeting on a yoga mat and talking knowledgeably about the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. And as far as I’m concerned, any movie with room for both Mallarmé and Ms. Gerwig is not to be despised entirely.“Lola Versus” is disappointing, though, even to the point of annoyance. In addition to her pals, Lola has mostly supportive parents (Debra Winger and Bill Pullman) who genially represent a vaguely defined older generation. The present generation is equally fuzzy, or rather composed of familiar, off-the-rack styles and references. I think I mentioned the yoga, but there also is a food truck and a series of kind-of-ironic riffs on stuff like “Beverly Hills 90210” and “The Godfather.”There are some belabored dating scenes (some featuring Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Lola’s rebound yuppie suitor) and a shocking amount of montage. And while the movie visits beloved Manhattan locations like Russ & Daughters and the High Line, it somehow makes New York feel dinky and contrived, like a lesser Austin, Tex., or a standing set on a studio backlot made up to look like Hipstertown.Is this mean? I’m sorry, but in the season of “Girls” a secondhand, sentimental sex comedy, however well-meaning, is not going to cut it. Lola deserves better.“Lola Versus” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, and discussion thereof.",0,200000.0,252603.0,0

O. SCOTT,Heroically Handy With a Corkscrew,"Perhaps the best thing about “The Equalizer” is how long it takes to reveal what everyone watching it knows from the start. Directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Denzel Washington, the movie was inspired by a 1980s television series about an elite C.I.A. assassin (played by Edward Woodward) who found a second career as a freelance vigilante, specializing in payback and in pre-emptive violence in defense of the innocent. Each bit of information in the previous sentence — to say nothing of the trailers and advertisements — is a clue that Mr. Washington’s character, Robert McCall, is not the bookish, solitary Boston guy he at first seems to be.Bob, who works at a Home Depot-like building supply store, is a widower with meticulous habits and friendly relations with most of the people he meets. A ready source of self-help catchphrases that would sound silly coming from anyone other than Mr. Washington, he is a mentor to a younger co-worker (Johnny Skourtis). When insomnia hits, Bob repairs to a 24-hour diner, where he drinks tea, reads classic novels and makes avuncular small talk with Alina, a young prostitute whose street name is Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz).Eventually, he’s going to kill someone, of course, but before he does, “The Equalizer” is disarmingly quiet, almost as if it were committed to remaining the low-key, lower-middle-class character study that nobody in the theater has bought a ticket to see.And then Bob takes out a room full of Russian mobsters, and the fun — which is to say the escalating bloodshed — begins in earnest. That first batch of bad guys, gored with corkscrews, brained with paperweights and sent off into the next world with anything else that comes to hand, were guilty of hurting Alina. It turns out that they sit at the bottom of a pyramid of depravity that reaches all the way to a man named Pushkin back in Moscow. Thinking that rival gangs might be moving in on his territory, Mr. Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) sends a lieutenant known as Teddy (Marton Csokas) to straighten things out and to provide enough evil mayhem to justify more righteous brutality on Bob’s part.Teddy’s elegantly tailored suits hide a chest full of prison tattoos, and his sneering sadism and fastidious diction mark him out for an especially painful death, though the rules of the genre dictate that we’ll have to wait for it. Once he shows up, painful death is pretty much all “The Equalizer” has on its mind. Alina, the innocent, vulnerable pretext for all the killing, pretty much disappears, though one of her colleagues (Haley Bennett) takes a turn in the victim role. Violence against women is handled discreetly, but the men stomp, stab, shoot and bludgeon one another with showy abandon and an almost erotic intensity.Bob — it might not be his real name — is chaste, and his motives are pure, though, in his past, he might have done some of the usual vaguely alluded-to “terrible things.” His decency licenses both his extreme brutality and our enjoyment of it. We can persuade ourselves that we are watching the spectacle of enacted justice rather than the sentimentalization of a homicidal sociopath.ImageAvenger of the vulnerable: Denzel Washington in “The Equalizer,” directed by Antoine Fuqua.CreditScott Garfield/Columbia PicturesReally, though, I’m splitting ethical hairs. Mr. Washington is, with Liam Neeson, one of our leading middle-aged action heroes, a rugged avenger whose craft and discipline endow even exploitative nonsense like this with a center of gravity. For his part, Mr. Fuqua, while not the world’s most subtle filmmaker, directs the action sequences with bluntness and clarity and effectively uses his star as an oasis of calm in a jumpy, nasty universe.I can’t help feeling a little bit sorry for some of the bad guys, though. Not Pushkin and Teddy and the midlevel pimp who beats up Alina. In a movie like this, due process for guys like that is properly supplied by a nail gun or a jagged piece of glass. (This may be the place to note that Bob, who never carries his own firearm, has a MacGyver — or do I mean MacGruber — level of ingenuity when it comes to weaponizing ordinary household objects.)But what about the lower-ranking muscle, the bald dudes with tattoos who have to open the doors of the black S.U.V.s and throw the first punches at a man they have no way of knowing is really an elite super-assassin? Were they warned about this in the job interview? Do they have health insurance? They’re really just working stiffs, too, and the way they’re treated seems a little unfair.“The Equalizer” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

It’s the flip side, or backside, of Bollywood’s sparkle, a place of intimidation, titillation and cash-for-reels deals, with only glimpses of cut-rate glamour.A lot of the time, though, we’re visually at the periphery with Sonu (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), whose greedy brother, Vicky (Anil George), hustles films for a gangster. Sonu’s a bump on a log, but he daydreams of making a romantic movie called “Miss Lovely” with a woman he spots on a train.Mr. Ahluwalia, however, is more invested in having the camera hang around frantic shoots and offices with safes than in pushing the binary drama of desire and shame. He also directed the documentary “John & Jane,” about Indian call centers, and “Miss Lovely” reflects an urge to document, with its prominent vintage telephones and patterned shirts and clunky tiny cars.In that way, there’s an echo of that behind-the-scenes Italophile fetish object “Berberian Sound Studio,” but with less humor and with a pointlessly patchy flow (not helped by a listless voice-over). Though fond of switching up angles and adding hand-held camerawork into the mix, Mr. Ahluwalia seems to resist indulging the many promising characters that populate this sub rosa scene. Though not pretentious, his film feels a tad overthought, held back somehow by a stubborn, dour obscurity clouding its freshly realized, lurid milieu.",0,,,1

Its soundtrack is an artwork in its own right, one worth savoring as you would a fine recording.This wordless movie, a documentary that is more like visual poetry, is the work of Bill Morrison, created from old newsreels and other film records, like his earlier work “The Miners’ Hymns.” Here his collaborator is the guitarist and composer Bill Frisell, whose score (performed by Mr. Frisell, Ron Miles, Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen) meshes with the images so evocatively that it seems as if they were born together.The flood was devastating, especially to what remained of the Mississippi Delta’s sharecropper economy, so much so that it helped change the country’s demographics, fueling the northward migration of blacks that had already been underway. With just the occasional bit of text on the screen, Mr. Morrison conveys the destruction and the aftermath, although he is sparse enough with the details that viewers might want to prepare by reading at least a summary of the disaster.The film and Mr. Frisell’s music are elegiac over all, but there are sparks of humor in the mournful journey: a rapid trip through a Sears catalog of the period; a look at government officials visiting flood zones for photo ops, much as they might today.Mr. Morrison’s résumé includes an entire movie about decaying film stock (“Decasia”), and his fascination with the phenomenon is evident in “The Great Flood.” A number of the film fragments he employs are beginning to deteriorate, and he happily leaves the eroded images as they are. Mr. Frisell’s music seems actually to be calling forth the flaws, like a modern-day digital effect. It’s a sublime, somewhat eerie touch in a striking experiment in music and moviemaking.",1,,,1

Once more, it spins on Peter Parker (the nice, boyish Tom Holland), a teenager who develops super-skills after he’s bitten by a troublesome spider. The title of the likable, amusing “Spider-Man: Homecoming” indicates that this is a return, though to what exactly? To Queens? To youth? The rest of us can’t go home again, but given that this is the second Spider-Man reboot in 15 years from Sony Pictures it seems Spidey has few other options.“Homecoming” is more or less about how Peter Parker needs to stay forever young, ideally 15 or so years old. What’s always been most appealing about Spider-Man is that he’s a kid, if one who can spin big, sticky webs and swing from rooftop to rooftop, comparatively rinky-dink talents in the flying, magic-hammering superhero world. What makes Spider-Man different and, ideally, work as a character, giving him an off-kilter charm, is he retains the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of adolescence. For all his super-gifts and despite the weird and dangerous company he keeps, he is also a teenage boy — that’s his Kryptonite, what cuts him down to recognizable human size.The team behind “Homecoming” certainly gets that Spider-Man is a kid, even if the movie plays the naïf angle too hard at times, making Peter look not just inexperienced but also silly, a borderline dumb cluck. The movie — credited to six writers and directed by Jon Watts — opens sometime after Peter has been bitten. He’s still trying to get his bearings and struggling to figure out the limits of his powers, which is complicated here by the fact that this is the first Spider-Man movie that Sony has made with Marvel Studios. It’s a liaison that has brought Spider-Man into the Marvel worldwide domination machine, which is why he’s being mentored in the way of the superhero by Marvel’s Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who pops in and out).That machine, known to executives and true believers as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is vast, complicated, lucrative and ever-expanding. It’s also intrinsically uninteresting for viewers (at least one!) who just want a good movie. Marvel has produced a string of movies of wildly divergent quality, but Sony has had a tougher time coming up with regular superhero successes. And so, after stumbling with its first “Spider-Man” resurrection, it cut a deal with Marvel, which is also not inherently interesting. Even so it’s modestly amusing to consider that Sony, much like Peter Parker here, needed help getting off the ground again, and so Marvel stepped in to play its Tony Stark-like guide.For its initial hour, “Homecoming” moves along breezily enough, though sometimes with too much forced airiness. It works best when it sticks close to Peter and is content to be a light, good-natured story of a teenager who’s navigating through, and often badly fumbling, the competing demands of school, home and his emergent Spidey self. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teenager than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing.Mr. Watts’s previous features include “Cop Car,” a slick, small-scaled nail-biter about two boys in peril that showed he knows where to put the camera, is good with actors and has a sadistic streak, which together presumably clinched his big-studio future. “Cop Car” is such an exercise in pressure-cooker cinema that it’s surprising how tamped down the sense of danger is in “Homecoming,” even in some of the earlier sequences in which Peter is still puzzling out how to scuttle and swing as he vanquishes villainy. A brief scene of him sneaking into his bedroom (to avoid Marisa Tomei’s Aunt May) has more tension than any single action set piece.It’s tough to know who the biggest creative force is in a corporate entity like “Homecoming” and how much Mr. Watts contributed to its look, vibe and feel. The movie isn’t visually distinctive over all, and while some of the better action scenes stick low to the ground, as when Spider-Man crashes through suburban backyards and plays bumper cars with trash cans, the airborne special-effects scenes are disappointingly lackluster, particularly in the age of ambitious, eye-stroking diversions like “Doctor Strange.” It’s hard to think of a single image in “Homecoming” that will transcend a first viewing the way that Peter and M. J.’s tender, topsy-turvy kiss did in Sam Raimi’s first “Spider-Man.”And then there’s Michael Keaton, who’s so very good in “Homecoming” that he suggests a future narrative path down which the older, more experienced Spider-Man might eventually go if ever allowed to truly grow up. Mr. Keaton plays the Vulture, the regulation baddie, who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind, with the usual yelling, minions and death. He flies around in a clunky winged apparatus that looks like something from the Wright Brothers’ steampunk phase. This makes for an amusing chunk of heavy-metal décor, but is mostly resonant as a tepid joke about Mr. Keaton’s aerial acrobatics in “Batman” and “Birdman.”The Vulture is a mess of prickly contradictions, only some of which seem intentional. His criminality, rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton, with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes, makes him a memorably angry man, not a caricature. The Vulture becomes a narrative counterweight to Tony Stark’s self-satisfied billionaire. But the Vulture is also the biggest enemy facing Spider-Man, who — as this movie reminds you — is a working-class kid turned superhero. Here, Spidey is eager to do a billionaire’s bidding, partly because he’s being readied to join the Avengers. The question is when Spidey really grows up, who will he fight for and why?",0,334166825.0,334198153.0,1

Its story pulls in all directions, and its mood, tone and backdrop are as serious as a Mafia hit. Yet its setup has the makings of a comedy sketch: A Sicilian mobster, Salvo (Saleh Bakri, holding every inch of screen), meets a blind woman, Rita (Sara Serraiocco), who soon after begins to see the light. It’s a moment that summons the New Testament prophecy about the blind seeing, but it’s also old-fashioned movie-made hokum. Much like the larger picture, the introduction switches between art house abstraction and blunt-force action, and opens on a man as beautifully sculptured and silent as a Michelangelo slab. This is Salvo — the word means safe in Italian — an enforcer and sometimes chauffeur for a criminal enterprise. Sprawled on a small bed in an equally undersized room, Salvo is pointedly waiting in the dark, a state that’s at once physical and metaphysical. It’s dawn in Palermo, the gritty Sicilian capital that the directors — Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza, making a very fine feature debut — turn into a stage for a story that, at times, could be titled “Once Upon a Time in Sicily.”Shortly after he dresses and leaves his inhospitable digs, Salvo is driving around his unnamed boss (Mario Pupella), an older man who’s riding shotgun. It’s here that we get our first good look at Salvo with a close-up of his eyes, an image that evokes a Sergio Leone signature shot and, like the lack of dialogue and ensuing action, suggests the movie’s affiliation with the spaghetti western. Somewhat to that end, there’s an uneasy, claustrophobic quality to this section, partly because we’re crowded into the car, too, but also because everything about the scene — the depopulated streets, the crumbling buildings, a train rocketing through the tense quiet — feels like a trap. The entrance of two gunmen on a motorcycle brutally breaks the silence, as fast-moving bullets and bodies shift the movie into another register.In a rush of violence, Salvo kills two would-be assassins and, despite his boss’s warning to stay put, chases two others. With the camera steadily dogging his every step, he shoots a third and sneaks into the home of a fourth. There, in the shadows, Salvo discovers Rita, the fourth man’s sister, who’s home alone, listening to the radio, while tallying large sums of cash. Soon both are creeping around in the dark as stealthily as cats — she intuits a presence — an encounter that’s scored by her panicked panting. A dancer making her first movie appearance, Ms. Serraiocco slips fluidly through the shadows, even as her crossed eyes fix on no one point (she wore special contact lenses for the role), while her hands awkwardly clutch at the dark.Rita and Salvo leave the house and eventually end up at an abandoned factory that’s set on a lonely hill, like a derelict fortress. It’s a striking location, with its atmospherically corroded interior and drapery of ragged plastic. As important, the factory also functions as a metaphor for the region’s history of economic catastrophe, and its mob and political corruption. There, amid the ruins, Rita and Salvo begin to break free of that legacy with a bond that brings to mind other tales of blind women and sighted men, including “City Lights” and “Magnificent Obsession.” Although the romance in “Salvo” remains tentative, in keeping with the movie’s art film ambiguity, the filmmakers’ embrace of the improbable evokes a movie time when crazy plot turns happened as a matter of melodramatic course. It isn’t long after Salvo and Rita arrive at the factory, though, that the movie starts to lose energy and focus. There are some pungent, lived-in scenes of Salvo back in his rooming house, where his threat is underscored through his encounters with the homeowners, a sour, frightened couple whose fear speaks to the mob’s grip on a people. Salvo’s kindness toward the couple’s neglected dog deepens the idea that his relationship with Rita has led to a moral awakening. But while this humanization of the hit man has obvious religious overtones, Mr. Grassadonia and Mr. Piazza don’t take this salvation theme all that far. They’re interested in miracles — for both the blind and the murderous — but their commitment to art film narrative ellipses and restraint seems to hold them back. They cork the crazy.",0,,,1

Like Johnny (Josh O’Connor), who labors on his struggling family farm in Yorkshire under the critical eyes of his sick father (Ian Hart) and stolid grandmother (Gemma Jones). For relief, he vents his frustrations in binge-drinking and furtive, feral sex with random young men.These taciturn encounters, unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer, suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self. But this bracing, sometimes brutal movie — the feature debut of the writer and director Francis Lee — doesn’t present Johnny’s sexuality as the cause of his self-loathing. Rather, it’s his imprisonment by a legacy he’s not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions.Both are about to be loosened. The arrival of Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a gentle, darkly handsome Romanian migrant worker, softens Johnny’s heart and the movie’s tone. Their passion isn’t pretty, but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors. Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer, the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale.Filmed with a naturalism that recalls Andrea Arnold’s 2012 dive into “Wuthering Heights,” “God’s Own Country” weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards’s biting cinematography and the story’s slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful. Bodily fluids — bestial and human — stain the screen, punctuating a story that’s as much about rediscovering place as finding love. So when Gheorghe looks out at the brooding countryside and murmurs “It’s beautiful here,” we sense that Johnny really doesn’t need persuading.",1,,,0

Whatever else it does or doesn’t do, “Chef,” Jon Favreau’s good-natured culinary comedy, works as an appetite stimulant. And where there’s delicious food — plenty is shown being prepared, served and devoured — there’s life.The movie, which Mr. Favreau wrote and directed, is a self-conscious return to the small-scale indie values of his early films, like “Swingers” and “Made,” although it is stuffed with stars, including Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Dustin Hoffman in cameo roles. This back-to-my roots fable can even be read as Mr. Favreau’s apologia after his 2011 tent-pole flop, “Cowboys & Aliens.”Whatever the reasons for Mr. Favreau’s retreat from the tent, he makes an agreeably blustery tour guide in a road movie that begins in Los Angeles, relocates to Miami, then returns to the West Coast by way of tasty stopovers in New Orleans and Austin, Tex. Through it all, Mr. Favreau’s gruff, roly-poly character, Carl Casper, a high-end Los Angeles chef whose ascent to gastronomic stardom is abruptly ended by a snooty restaurant critic, never loses his enthusiasm for cooking, eating and living.In this shallow but enjoyable all-American morality play, Carl falls but rises, chastened, to pursue happiness and fulfillment operating a food truck whose specialty is Cuban sandwiches. Those sandwiches, the movie tells us none too convincingly, are far tastier and more wholesome than the carefully arranged, high-priced elaborate dishes Carl created in his heyday.“Chef” arrives at an opportune moment for a hearty celebration of the putatively redemptive joys of downward mobility. The movie exalts the superiority of inexpensive real food, served on the street, for real people in the American melting pot. Only when Carl forsakes his lofty ambitions does he begin to cook food he “believes in.”The major complaint of the critic, Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt), with whom Carl fights a losing war of words on Twitter, is that Carl is stuck in a rut that has robbed his cuisine of its soul. But as played by Mr. Platt, Ramsey is not the poisonous Addison DeWitt of the food world but a mild-mannered epicurean with a sharp literary tongue.No one is a villain in this aggressively feel-good movie. On the evening Ramsey appears, Carl is pressured by the restaurant’s owner (Mr. Hoffman) not to follow his instincts and experiment but to serve the same-old, same-old dishes; he is predictably pilloried on Ramsey’s blog. Making matters infinitely worse, Carl, who is naïve about social media, is brought up short when his venomous response to the review goes viral and is followed by an angry face-to-face encounter with Ramsey that is captured on diners’ smartphones.The melting pot in “Chef” is not theoretical. Carl’s ex-wife, Inez (Sofia Vergara), who encourages him to start over with a food truck, is a Latina. Both Los Angeles and Miami are buzzing, multicultural hubs in which Carl’s unfamiliarity with Spanish is a disadvantage. And Carl is so likable that his Hispanic line cook (John Leguizamo) follows him to Miami and acts as a middleman and interpreter for day laborers who had ignored him when he asked them for help setting up the truck.If “Chef,” in its second half, is little more than a glorified travelogue, it is buoyed by a terrific soundtrack that mixes salsa, soul music and country blues with Caribbean styles. That said, the movie’s exploration of multiculturalism isn’t any deeper than that of an average episode of “Modern Family.”A sentimental subplot involves Carl’s relationship with his partly estranged 10-year-old son, Percy (Emjay Anthony), who becomes his social media tutor. Once Carl has time to spend with the boy, “Chef” tells a standard father-son bonding story in which a devoted dad passes on his wisdom. “Chef” believes in work, and as father and son scour and spruce up a battered taco truck that Inez’s wealthy first husband (Mr. Downey) gives Carl, the film earns points by eschewing magical thinking and showing the intensive labor behind the rattletrap’s transformation into a jazzy-looking mobile kitchen.Food trucks, Twitter wars and salsa music: “Chef” has its pinkie on the pulse of the moment.“Chef” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some strong language and sexual references.",0,23678226.0,31424003.0,0

From its robotic acting to its generic props (enough already with the self-motivated children’s toys), this shoddy sequel, tacked together with the cynicism of a carnival barker, suggests that the director, James Wan, is long overdue for a vacation.Traumatized by the events of the first film, from which we pick up immediately, Renai and Josh Lambert (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson) leave the police to deal with the murdered medium spoiling their home and move in with Josh’s mother (Barbara Hershey). We all know how that usually works out, and, sure enough, it’s mere minutes before the couple and their children are once again terrorized by malevolent spirits.A nasty shade wants to possess Josh’s body, though we must travel back to 1986 before learning who and why. Or maybe the answer lies with the underemployed phantoms lurking in an abandoned hospital — who knows?Certainly not the two klutzy ghost hunters from the original film, whose presence here is as redundant as Mr. Wilson’s B.F.A. in drama. Playing a character who does little but materialize and dematerialize in gloomy rooms, Mr. Wilson wears the same frozen expression throughout. It’s the face of a man contemplating a future in movies like this.“Insidious: Chapter 2” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

This slight effort by the prolific filmmaker Joe Swanberg flirts with fetishism, all right — the kind that finds titillation in images of half-naked dead women: hanging from a doorknob, on train tracks, in a bathtub with slit wrists. Some are tableaus Billy has created; others are actual murder scenes. Naturally, a detective (Simon Barrett) investigates Billy and his crew to see if there’s a connection.Mr. Swanberg, a mumblecore pioneer, has explored sexual issues before (“Autoerotic”) and dabbled in horror (with a segment in the anthology “V/H/S”). But “24 Exposures” plays like an exercise. With a thin plot — the usual parade of possible killers — it falls to the actors to provide zing.What we get are previous Swanberg collaborators like Mr. Wingard (a horror director himself, but an uncharismatic performer) and Mr. Barrett (also a director, but a decent actor here). Sophia Takal, as a naïve model; Caroline White, as Billy’s girlfriend; and Helen Rogers, as a gullible waitress, are appealing but largely subordinate to Mr. Swanberg’s male-skewed perspective.

Straining the seams of his thrash-metal T-shirts, Scott is a burly, balding obsessive whose face appears to have been molded from Play-Doh. With a hated doughnut-delivery job and his ailing grandmother for a roommate, Scott comes alive only as the tyrannical fulcrum of a weekly game of his own devising, bossing his friends through Tolkienesque adventures.But when one player leaves to save his marriage, Scott reluctantly recruits Miles (Garrett Graham), a charming übergeek with a popular blog and the least attainable fantasy of all: a gorgeous girlfriend. Fanning all of Scott’s insecurities, Miles is the perfect nemesis, and as Scott’s life gradually dismantles, the directors, Katie Graham and Andrew Matthews, indulge his reprehensible behavior.

Best known for losing her head to the king, first metaphorically, then literally, Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman, saucy), along with her sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson, sedate), entered the court of the king (Eric Bana, brooding and glowering) when he was still wed to Catherine  of Aragon (Ana Torrent). A man of considerable and changeable appetites, the king yearned for a male heir and anything in a frock who wasn’t the queen. His sexual wish was their command.According to this oddly plotted and frantically paced pastiche — written by Peter Morgan, directed by Justin Chadwick — the girls were more or less the Paris and Nicky Hilton of the Tudor court. In the film’s version of the Boleyn family saga, based on the novel by Philippa Gregory of the same title, they were pimped out by their scheming, ambitious father, Sir Thomas (a spidery Mark Rylance), who sought to advance the family on the backs of his daughters while Mrs. Sir Thomas  (Kristin Scott Thomas) clucked darkly from the sidelines. Forced to compete for kingly favors, the women were soon rivals, a contest that, in its few meagerly entertaining moments, recalls the sisterly love in “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”The story of Anne Boleyn may sound as if it’s been cut from classier cloth than that delirious Robert Aldrich film, but history tells a juicier story. One of Anne’s biographers, Joanna Denny, writes that while at the French court Mary got around (she was “passed on from man to man”),  which I don’t remember from high school or public television. Instead of letting the story rip, though, the film plays it safe and predictable by dividing the sisters into the bad brunette and gentle blonde, thereby displacing the courtly intrigue onto two warring women. The Boleyn sisters were the kind of trouble that can make for bodice-ripping entertainment, but they were also the kind of unruly women who sometimes risked burning.Anne faced the sword, not the stake, but that’s jumping ahead of this story and its galloping horses, bustling  gowns and rampaging royals. It’s a marvel that something that feels so inert should have so much frenetic action. Shot in high-definition video with a murky brown palette (perhaps to suggest tea-stained porcelain and teeth), the film is both underwritten and overedited. Many of the scenes seem to have been whittled down to the nub, which at times turns it into a succession of wordless gestures and poses. Given the generally risible dialogue, this isn’t a bad thing, despite Mr. Morgan’s previous credits (notably “The Queen”).

He Just Doesn’t Know It Yet.,"Bluff and bowlegged, with a neat side part in his hair and a spine as straight as a schooner’s mast, Brad Pitt strides into “War Machine” in a gust of masculine self-assurance. The sardonic tones of the accompanying narration — voiced by someone whose identity will be revealed later on — are an early indication that Mr. Pitt may not be the hero of the story. Glen McMahon, the four-star general he is playing, has no doubts on that score. McMahon, a man of many macho nicknames (the Glenimal, for example) is a man’s man, a soldier’s soldier, a warrior with the soul of a poet — the walking embodiment of just about every cliché in the book.But the particular book that inspired “War Machine,” “The Operators” by Michael Hastings, is a sharp, nuanced deconstruction of the modern military mythology. The book grew out of a notorious Rolling Stone profile of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who was put in charge of the war in Afghanistan in 2009 and proceeded to blow up his own career. Mr. Hastings, who died in 2013, sketched a rollicking, damning portrait of a commander in over his head, enthralled by his own hype and in less than perfect control of his mouth. That’s the guy Mr. Pitt is supposed to be.In adapting Mr. Hastings’s journalism, David Michôd, the writer and director of “War Machine,” also streaming on Netflix, has taken some risks of his own. The movie is fiction, but it hugs the shore of reality, occasionally running aground on the facts. It’s a bit awkward — though not unusual — for semi-invented characters to brush up against real people. Anthony Michael Hall plays a volatile colleague of McMahon’s who seems to be based on Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whose more recent adventures may provide fodder for a sequel. The actual President Obama appears on a television news clip, and is played later in a brief scene on an airport tarmac by an actor named Reggie Brown. Ben Kingsley wickedly impersonates Hamid Karzai, at the time the president of Afghanistan.That is a brilliant piece of casting. At its best, “War Machine” crackles with irreverent wit, even if American political craziness circa 2009 looks tame compared with the 2017 version. It takes a while to get going, though. A raft of secondary characters is introduced via voice-over, but most of them fade into the desert-camo background. The few that stand out — Mr. Hall’s fireplug, Topher Grace’s glib fixer — make the labored introductions superfluous. And as you follow McMahon through the first stages of his new assignment, you may wish for a speedier, snappier rhythm.Mr. Michôd’s satirical intentions call out for something like the rapid-fire cynicism of Armando Iannucci, creator of “Veep” and director of “In the Loop,” or the gonzo iconoclasm of David O. Russell’s “Three Kings.” But after a sluggish and chaotic start, “War Machine” finds its groove and becomes its own thing: a mordant, cleareyed critique of American war-making that is all the more devastating for being affectionately drawn.McMahon may be a blowhard and kind of an idiot, but he’s not a bad guy. His judgment can be questioned, but not his sincerity. He is beloved by most of the men in his charge and unflinchingly committed to them. Their belief in him is exceeded only by his belief in himself as a legendary, larger-than-life figure. Everyone knows that he runs seven miles every morning, sleeps four hours a night and eats one meal a day. He his devoted to his wife (a wonderfully sly Meg Tilly) even though, as she points out over an anniversary dinner, they have spent 30 days in each other’s company over the past eight years.McMahon is no tomcat, but no choirboy either. His attractive qualities of bluntness and loyalty are offset by a propensity for passive-aggressiveness in his dealings with civilian authority and a dogmatic attachment to some pretty dubious ideas. He is convinced that the war can be won and that he is the man who can win it. His hubris would be tragic if his overestimation of his own abilities were not so farcical.Mr. Michôd, whose previous films include “Animal Kingdom,” a gamy crime drama, and “The Rover,” a dusty post-apocalyptic thriller, gestures toward the grim futility of the war on the ground. A subplot involves a young marine (Lakeith Stanfield), who questions the strategy he must nonetheless carry out, with terrible consequences. But most of the action is far from combat, consisting of hushed meetings and heated arguments.“War Machine” effectively rebuts the evergreen notion that military leaders are held back from victory by politicians and bureaucrats. It’s not that the political and diplomatic aspects of American policy are excused, but rather that failure, to reverse the old saying, has a thousand fathers. McMahon, clinging to his faith in the dubious doctrines of counterinsurgency, chases after an illusory victory that his allies, colleagues and bosses don’t really believe in any more. Is he ridiculous or noble? A little of both, perhaps.But “War Machine,” as its title hints, is not entirely about him. Mr. Pitt’s performance is engaging and complicated — somehow recalling both the wily and ruthless Aldo Raine of “Inglourious Basterds” and the lethally stupid Chad Feldheimer of “Burn After Reading” — but the film’s most memorable words are none of the jargon that comes out of McMahon’s mouth. In one indelible scene, a German member of Parliament (Tilda Swinton) delivers a calm, respectful and unsparing demolition of the American position. It is too long and complicated to quote here, but in another scene an Afghan villager offers a three-word summary: “Please leave now.”",0,,,0

Worse, Duleep (Satinder Sartaaj) remains a handsome cipher, brooding in the shadows of his own story until, upon occasion, someone thinks to ask, “What troubles you?”His troubles are many: He was forcibly taken from Punjab as a boy and has lived in exile in England, where he has become a Christian like his guardians. And though Queen Victoria (Amanda Root, wasted) has taken him under her wing, Duleep wants to see his mother again. And he wants to be a Sikh. And he wants to rule Punjab.A dramatic life does not necessarily a dramatic film make. Some of this story is told in quick flashbacks; but most of it unfolds in conversations in handsome period settings. Throughout, the characters’ interior lives are opaque. At one point Duleep, returning from a thwarted trip to India, stops in Cairo. Handing out diplomas at a girls’ school, he spies a beautiful young woman. Cut to: They have tea. Cut to: They’re married. Cut to: They have three children. Soon, more brooding. (“Sir, something sits heavy on your mind.”)The movie perks up briefly when the great Shabana Azmi appears, playing Duleep’s mother, a woman losing her sight and possibly her mind. Ms. Azmi seems to understand what the movie needs: a jolt of emotion and some life, regal or otherwise.",0,,,1

As the Lieblings engage in exhaustive preparations for Lior’s bar mitzvah, we see a sweet-natured, high-functioning young man enjoy a level of assimilation — and attention — granted to few of the mentally disabled. A near-celebrity within his neighborhood, Lior seems unaware of his real-world limitations — a fact that worries his stepmother, Lynne Iser, though not his father, Mordechai.Patiently and delicately, Ms. Trachtman teases out the tricky dynamics of a family dealing with a disabled child. Lior’s devoted brother, Yoni,  sometimes resents being expected to take on parental responsibilities (“This is not my job”), while his older sister, Reena, recalls becoming a surrogate mother after the death of their mother in 1997.Most touching  is the 11-year-old Anna, who, as the youngest, laments her displacement as the center of attention. “It’s kind of annoying,” she tells us with charming candor. And watching everything in the household revolve around Lior, it’s clear that the price of his happiness may be steeper for some than for others.PRAYING WITH LIOROpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Ilana Trachtman; directors of photography, Slawomir Grunberg and Ari Haberberg; edited by Zelda Greenstein; music by Andy Statman; released by First Run Features.

It is also, unfortunately, a movie that is nowhere near as original as its monster,  a strain of malevolent, seemingly intelligent jungle vine with a taste for human flesh.Adapted by Scott B. Smith from his best-selling novel of the same title, and directed by Carter Smith (not  related to the author),  the film follows four attractive young Americans (Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey) as they join a handsome German, Mathias (Joe Anderson), on a trip to jungle ruins in Mexico to meet up with Mathias’s brother and his archaeologist girlfriend.In slasher-movie tradition, these happy wanderers prove as stupid as they are arrogant, disregarding the bad-omen appearance of a couple of spooky Mayan children, seemingly on loan from “Apocalypto” and rappelling down into the gloomy depths of a temple without a plan or a clue. Back in the day, Richard Pryor might have mined a comedy routine from this movie.With its numerous images of well-off first-world tourists being devoured by a third-world environment and forced to contemplate hacking off infected body parts, “The Ruins” could have been the most politically provocative horror film since “Bug” was released last year. It settles for gore and pain instead.“The Ruins” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, profanity and violence.",0,17402425.0,17432844.0,0

Directed by Baltasar Kormakur, riffing on the cheerful irreverence of Shane Black and the hyperbolic style of Tony Scott, the movie turns on a pair of seemingly bad guys who may be good. A reissue of the five-part comic series on which it’s based sets the scene nicely: “Two guys walk into a bank. It goes badly.” It does in the movies as well, although now the duo spring off the page courtesy of Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, one of the better odd couples to bond and bicker since Mel met Danny.A smooth operator, Bobby (Mr. Washington), and a fast talker, Stig (Mr. Wahlberg), are the resident ebony-and-ivory tag — but are they cops or are they robbers? Stig certainly sounds like a nod to Riggs, the funny, frantic cop played by Mel Gibson in the “Lethal Weapon” series, as does Stig’s jokey yammering, military-honed skill set and concern for animal welfare. (Mr. Wahlberg has the sweet appeal of the young Mr. Gibson if none of the unnerving dangerousness.) In Steven Grant’s original comic, Stig is called Steadman, and Bobby looks like a California surfer complete with a blond flop and goatee. The casting of Mr. Washington, augmented with a fully upholstered chin, underscores the “Lethal Weapon” connection even if he sexes up the joint in a way that Danny Glover’s family man never could.Written by Blake Masters, who embellishes the tricky story with generous repartee, the movie opens with Stig and Bobby edging around a Texas town and then settling into a diner for some breakfast and banter. An irrepressible flirt, Stig plays with a pretty waitress, but it’s soon clear that his heart belongs to Bobby. (Unlike in the “Lethal Weapon” series, there isn’t a dead wife or a living brood to bring anyone down.) Across from the diner there’s also a tiny bank that Bobby and Stig plan to relieve of $3 million belonging to Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos), the head of a Mexican drug cartel who, in turn, has recently relieved an associate of his head.That head, briefly seen peeking out of a satchel, is a cheerfully vulgar touch, as is the glib use of Mexican cartel violence. Both feel almost calculated to offend, but like many other action movies of this blithe type, “2 Guns” doesn’t take place in the here and the now but in a burlesque version of the same. Some of its artificiality can be chalked up to the usual mainstream filmmaking imperatives, like stars who are at once recognizably real and prettier, thinner and sleeker, with whiter teeth and glossier skin, like the operative for the Drug Enforcement Agency played here by Paula Patton. Even Mr. Olmos’s beautiful, craggy mug looks buffed. That same unreality principle extends to the story and Mr. Kormakur’s bright, uncluttered style, which instantly shake off the real world and its obligations, thrusting the film straight into fantasy. It’s an enjoyable place to be, even more so as this twisty film grows increasingly complicated and preposterous with the addition of some Navy types (James Marsden and Fred Ward, among others), a Central Intelligence Agency whack job (a funny Bill Paxton) swooping in on a black helicopter and empty gesturing at corrupt national institutions. Working with an editor, Michael Tronick, who doesn’t step on the sometimes wittily choreographed action by overcutting, Mr. Kormakur sets and keeps up a fast rather than frantic pace that never runs the movie off the rails even when the story nearly does. Much as he did in his last movie, “Contraband,” another thriller with Mr. Wahlberg, Mr. Kormakur has put his imprimatur on a pulp fiction that easily could have become another generic diversion instead of a fine genre one. “2 Guns” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence throughout, including a disturbing scene involving live chickens that’s both played for laughs and comes with a sharp, ethical jab.",0,73500000.0,75612460.0,1
367,2013-11-27,Black Nativity,"Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Jennifer Hudson, Tyrese Gibson",USA,Kasi Lemmons,"Drama, Family, Music, Musical",English,48.0,93.0,"Langston Hughes (based on the play by), Kasi Lemmons (written for the screen by)",2013,4.6,1839.0,51.0,2017-11-02 04:18:18,MANOHLA DARGIS,"Christmas in Harlem, and O Come, All Ye Songs","Sometimes it takes just one thing — a gesture, a look, the quality of light on a face — to fall for a movie. For me, that moment came in the musical “Black Nativity,” when several characters, including a young couple — Jo-Jo and his very pregnant companion, Maria (Luke James and Grace Gibson) — sing a sharply reworked “Silent Night.” “They say this is your punishment for such poor judgment,” Maria sings on a cold Harlem night. “How you gonna feed it?” That line slips by quickly, but with that two-letter word — “it” — the movie ferociously closes the gap between one homeless child born into poverty and all the forgotten rest.Directed by Kasi Lemmons, “Black Nativity” is itself a reworking of the Langston Hughes “gospel song-play” of the title. Originally called “Wasn’t That a Mighty Day!,” the play relates the Nativity story with all black characters, telling it partly through traditional carols and spirituals — from “Joy to the World” to “My Way’s Cloudy” — as well as through passages from the Gospel and Hughes’s writing. “There’s fire in the east/There’s fire in the west/There’s fire among the Methodists” is one of its funnier lines. Only two narratively thin acts long, it commences with Jesus’ birth and ends with songs and sermons that, for better or worse, suggest what it’s like to be in church. (“There’s nobody like the Lord!”) When it opened off Broadway in 1961, with a cast including Marion Williams, it turned the audience into a congregation. To open the play up, or maybe dust it off, Ms. Lemmons has jettisoned much of the original’s inner workings, including its comic shepherds, heavy sermonizing and Hughes’s staging instructions. Here, the time is now, and the place is principally Harlem. It’s there that the teenage Langston (Jacob Latimore) is sent by his struggling single mother, Naima (Jennifer Hudson), to spend Christmas with his grandparents, the righteously overbearing Rev. Cornell Cobbs (Forest Whitaker) and his warmer half, Aretha (Angela Bassett). A stranger to his grandparents — the plot hinges on a family quarrel — Langston moves in grudgingly, wearing the mask of masculine cool even as he sings “Motherless Child.” As the camera sweeps across 125th Street and past old Harlem and new, Langston’s world opens, and mysteries hover at the edge, including one named Loot (a quietly charismatic Tyrese Gibson).An actress turned director of “Eve’s Bayou” and “Talk to Me,” Ms. Lemmons has a tough time finding her tone. From scene to scene, the actors are good and then less so, while the direction wavers from assured to unsteady. The setup in Baltimore, where Naima and Langston are facing eviction, is unpromisingly static, as are Ms. Hudson’s and Mr. Latimore’s performances, which both improve dramatically when they start singing. Ms. Hudson is an innately warm presence who’s still finding her way as an actress, but she generates so much good will that even when she’s not letting loose that torrent of a voice, she holds your attention. The same goes for Mr. Latimore, whose character leads with his petulant child’s chin but follows through with beseeching eyes.“Black Nativity” uses its songs to advance the story — characters simply begin singing their hopes and fears — but it also uses them to represent both Langston’s reality and his fantasies. There’s always a degree of blissful unreality when someone starts warbling in the middle of the street in a musical, as happens in this movie. Or when Aretha — Ms. Bassett sings! (kind of) — has an imaginary duet with Naima through the magic of montage, the scene cutting between the women in different cities. But there’s something particularly liberating in musical dream sequences, in which anything can go and sometimes does, as when Langston dreams up a Nativity in Times Square with camels and turbaned celebrants in a sequence that mirrors Hughes’s own creative process. The only problem with that Times Square hallucination, with its spinning camera and swirling color, is that it feels too short, which is true of the movie over all, despite the dragginess brought on by its thin plot, clichés and bouts of overfamiliarity. And as you listen to the gorgeous “Hush Child (Get You Through This Silent Night)” or a blow-the-roof-off version of Stevie Wonder’s “As” — the executive music producer is Raphael Saadiq — it becomes increasingly clear that the entire movie probably should have been sung. Because, at her best in “Black Nativity,” Ms. Lemmons, who also helped write some songs, has found a way to exalt the past while remaining rooted in the present in a movie that flirts with nonrealist theatricality even as it barrels right toward old-fashioned cornball entertainment. “Black Nativity” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There’s a gun, but, otherwise, this is squeaky clean.",0,4894004.0,7013678.0,0

Lewis (novel)",2008,6.5,171620.0,67.0,2017-11-02 04:18:07,A. O. SCOTT,"Out of the Wardrobe, Into a War Zone","Here in the unenchanted world of ordinary moviegoing, it has been about two and a half years  since “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,” the first installment in Walt Disney and Walden Media’s mighty “Chronicles of Narnia” franchise. In wartime England, where the Pevensie children live when they’re not consorting with talking lions and battling witches, a year or so has gone by. But in Narnia itself, to which the four plucky Pevensies return in “Prince Caspian,” the second movie in the series, centuries have passed, and everything has changed. The grand hall where Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy were made monarchs of the realm has fallen into ruin, and the friendly woodland creatures with their homey British accents and computer-animated fur seem to have vanished from the scene.When the exiled child kings and queens are thrown back into Narnia (thanks to a sudden outbreak of special effects in a London tube station), they seem no longer to be in a children’s fantasy story but rather in some kind of Jacobean tragedy, a reminder that C. S. Lewis was, along with everything else, a scholar of English Renaissance literature. In a dark castle in a dark forest, men with heavy armor and beard-shadowed faces quarrel and conspire. Instead of fauns and Turkish delight, there are murder and betrayal, and a grave, martial atmosphere lingers over the story,  even when the spunky dwarfs and chatty rodents return. (Aslan the lion also shows up eventually, speaking in the soothing voice of Liam Neeson.)So “Prince Caspian” is quite a bit darker than “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,” both in look and in mood. It is also in some ways more satisfying. Its violent (though gore-free) combat scenes and high body count may rattle very young viewers, but older children are likely to be drawn into the thick political intrigue. The relative scarcity of digital effects in the first part of the movie allows the director, Andrew Adamson, and  the director of photography, Karl Walter Lindenlaub, to explore the beauty of the Narnian landscape by more traditional cinematic means. Its lush glades and rocky escarpments provide a reminder that the supernaturalism of fairy tales originates in the magic of the natural world.And tales of heroic adventure, however fanciful, are grounded in human problems of power, cruelty and conflict. “Prince Caspian” is named for its square-jawed, rather bland hero (played by Ben Barnes), but its major source of dramatic energy is the villain, Caspian’s uncle Miraz, who is played with malignant grandeur by the great Italian actor Sergio Castellitto. Miraz is a classic royal usurper, who has taken the throne from Caspian’s father, the rightful king, and who plans to pass it along to his own newborn son once Caspian is out of the way. His court is a viper’s nest of double-dealing and shifting allegiance.Cue grumpy dwarfs, swashbuckling mice and apple-cheeked Pevensies. And hail the popular struggle of the Narnian underground! Since the  Telmarines took over and suppressed the old magic, a hardy remnant of Narnians has been hiding amid the pacified trees, sustaining themselves with the legends of King Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Queen Lucy (Georgie Henley), Queen Susan (Anna Popplewell) and High King Peter (William Moseley). When these rulers return, they rescue Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), a small, angry Narnian taken prisoner by Miraz’s soldiers, and eventually join Prince Caspian, who exchanges some long, half-smoldering looks with Susan.In spite of this hint of romance, what ensues is basically a war movie, with elaborate battle sequences in a castle courtyard and on a grassy plain, accompanied by thundering hoofbeats, whizzing arrows, clanking swords and Harry Gregson-Williams’s rousing score. These sections are ostensibly what the public wants to see, and certainly what the producers pay heavily to bring to life. There is a risk of sameness and tedium, which Mr. Adamson does not entirely overcome, though he and his fellow screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, sprinkle in enough witty dialogue to keep the movie’s long middle from feeling like too much of a slog.The main characters, whose sometimes fractious sibling dynamic provided the first “Narnia” movie with a hint of psychological complexity, seem a little flatter here, as if they’ve grown accustomed to their jobs as action heroes. And “Prince Caspian” isn’t really about them, anyway, except insofar as the kids in the audience identify with their courage and good sense.The cloak of allegory in which Lewis swathed the Narnia books is worn lightly on the screen, and some of their charm and novelty has been  chipped away —  not so much by any lapse on the part of the filmmakers as by a sense of familiarity. Tales of good and evil set in enchanted lands populated by mythical beasts are ubiquitous these days,  which may diminish the power of each new spell. The Pevensie children  can withdraw to London between episodes, but moviegoers are unlikely, and also perhaps unwilling, to escape from Narnia and the other increasingly numerous, and therefore increasingly mundane, places like it.“The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). This rating may be a little misleading, since some of the violence is fairly intense, and some of the deaths may unsettle younger children.THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIANOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Andrew Adamson; written by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Mr. Adamson, based on the C.

Looking back nearly a year to the night rock’s elder statesmen gathered at Madison Square Garden for a concert to raise money for victims of Hurricane Sandy, it shows what celebrities and corporate honchos can accomplish when they pool their energies for the greater good. The actor Tony Danza, who appears briefly in the film, cites the phrase on the United States seal, “E pluribus unum” (“Out of many, one”), as defining the spirit of the event. “12-12-12” is not really a concert movie so much as it is a densely compacted scrapbook of moments onstage and off. A close-up examination of high-powered, mostly male teamwork driven by a collective sense of purpose, it includes too much self-congratulatory celebrity schmoozing and hugging for comfort. But that’s how it always is at these star-studded events. The Concert for Sandy Relief was very similar to the Concert for New York City, in 2001, which raised $65 million in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and there are flashbacks to the earlier event, which involved many of the same musical and corporate hands.The elders include Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Eric Clapton and Roger Waters, all now in their mid-60s to early 70s. If most look much the worse for wear (Mr. Springsteen is an exception), they still produce a mighty sound, and the image of Mick Jagger whirling and dancing through “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” is an astonishing vision of age-defying flexibility and confidence.“This has got to be the largest collection of old English musicians ever assembled,” he remarks from the stage. Consciously or not, “12-12-12” makes a generational statement about institutionalized rock culture and civic responsibility, and I wondered if the same spirit would be passed to succeeding generations of musicians. Younger performers include Kanye West (introduced facetiously as “the very humble Kanye West”); Alicia Keys, who performs “Empire State of Mind”; and Chris Martin of Coldplay, who sings “Losing My Religion” with Michael Stipe. But will they achieve the mythic stature of their baby-boomer forerunners? Or is this the end of something? The one moment of real drama occurs when James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Garden, is informed of a glitch that may have resulted in a sudden plunge of online donations. He loses his temper and issues threats. Harvey Weinstein, another of the event’s prime movers, spots Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, in the audience and summons him to help. There is just enough disaster footage to convey a sense of catastrophe, and the movie periodically cuts away to a bar in Red Hook, the Brooklyn neighborhood hit hard by the storm, for a sense of hometown solidarity. The fervor exhibited by Bon Jovi, Mr. Joel and, especially, Mr. Springsteen, that ultimate New Jersey boy, in his fiercely majestic performances of “Land of Hope and Dreams,” “Wrecking Ball,” and “My City of Ruins” lends “12-12-12” an impassioned personal edge. But for sheer entertainment, Adam Sandler’s uproarious off-color parody of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” injects the film with an inspired note of raucous comedy that undercuts any pretensions to solemnity. “12-12-12” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language.",0,,,0

Have you heard? On big screens across the nation women are behaving badly, really badly. And now, bringing up the rear of this summer raunch parade led by “Snatched,” “Rough Night” and “Girls Trip,” comes the rather tame “Fun Mom Dinner.” These mothers just want a night off for boozy shenanigans and some smoking in the girls’ room, which, of course, leads to harmless karaoke antics, mild flirtations, an Instagram faux pas and pot-induced paranoia.These gals don’t start out as reunited pals, though — they only know one another through their children’s school. There’s bad blood between Kate (Toni Collette), who’s too cool for the dreaded Mom circle, and Melanie (Bridget Everett), a brash taskmaster with strong feelings about traffic safety. They stand down after a few puffs of a peace pipe in the form of a marijuana vaporizer pen and some encouragement from the recently divorced Jamie (Molly Shannon), a social media oversharer, and the new-to-the-school Emily (Katie Aselton), whose marriage is in a rut.The director Alethea Jones, working from Julie Rudd’s thin script, opens with a dutiful montage of the women’s morning routines. (Cue the requisite baby poop disaster and the Go-Go’s singing “Head Over Heels.”) The continuous intercutting, however — must we keep checking in with the dads and kids? — eventually grows tiresome and distracting.All four actresses have a natural chemistry and manage to give some inner dimensions to these otherwise archetypal characters. Though Ms. Aselton’s Emily is only marginally more realized than the others, it’s Ms. Everett who delivers the most memorable lines (“Oprah and Gayle, care to open up the friendship circle?”) — not at all surprising for those familiar with Ms. Everett’s, um, less-than-wholesome wine-soaked cabaret stage work.",0,,,1
371,2013-08-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:17,MIRIAM BALE,Meet the Boys: A Mutual Lovefest,"The popularity of the British-Irish boy band One Direction has been fueled largely by extraordinarily active Twitter fans, mostly tween and teenage girls. But seeing “One Direction: This Is Us” is a chance to experience that high-pitched hysteria viscerally as the girls in the theater call out for their favorite band members. Affections seem equally divided, except for one member, Harry Styles, the obvious heartthrob, who resembles a less gnomish Mick Jagger.Though the 3-D effects in this concert film directed by Morgan Spurlock (“Super Size Me”) are barely noticed, its enhanced, real-life surround sound can be alternately terrifying and a little thrilling. The film contains enough gratuitous naked torsos that it is sure to satisfy those fans. But is it of interest to anyone else? It is a chance to ponder just why these five “boys,” who range in age from 19 to 21, are pegged as the new Justin Biebers. Unlike Mr. Bieber, they don’t seem to be musical prodigies. Only one plays an instrument onstage, and none of them dance well.Mr. Spurlock centers the film on performances that are not particularly riveting, as the guys slouch over microphones singing to girls in the crowds, and directly to the camera, about how they love their fans and think they’re perfect despite their stomachs and thighs. “They say what we want to hear and what no one say to us,” one fan says.The scale of the group’s intense following has been compared to Beatlemania, though it might be more accurate to liken One Direction to a tossed salad of 1960s British Invasion bands. It’s as if Mr. Jagger and Ringo Starr had been in Herman’s Hermits. The backstage performances, rather than those onstage, make the film watchable. Mr. Spurlock hopes to get across that, unlike past prefab boy bands, these are five very different characters who happen to be in a group. And that’s the truth: The members were put together on the “The X Factor” three years ago after each auditioned individually. (Simon Cowell, a judge on that show, is a producer of this film.) In a previous era, they might have been in rival bands of different styles. Instead, their popularity seems reflective of certain magpie tendencies today: an indiscriminate and imitative mixing of influences from the Backstreet Boys to classic rock, a borrowing of whatever is useful. With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history, it’s a shame that a filmmaker wasn’t hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional. In the end credits — Richard Lester-style scenes of the boys in costumes doing pranks — we see how this film might have been more successful: as an obvious fiction starring these appealing personalities rather than a tame and somewhat fake documentary.“One Direction: This Is Us” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild language.",0,,,1

The advocacy documentary “Vanishing Pearls,” which opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles and will have one-night engagements in cities across the country over the next three months, makes an impassioned case that the spill’s effects still linger.Nailah Jefferson’s film zeros in on the small Gulf community of Pointe à la Hache, La., about an hour from New Orleans, where the oyster industry has been devastated, leaving out-of-work fishermen and their families. The movie charges that legal settlements were slowly and ineffectively distributed. (Wes Tunnell, the marine biologist who provided the victim’s compensation fund with projections on how quickly the Gulf might rebound, expresses reservations about how his report was used.) More than one person compares fighting BP, which leased the runaway well, to fighting God.Don’t expect much in the way of balance — the claims administrator Kenneth Feinberg plays defense in an interview — or anything other than the standard info-doc presentation (talking heads, news clips). “Vanishing Pearls” is most illuminating when offering a historical perspective. The Pointe à la Hache fishing industry descended from a sharecropping model, with money flowing upward; the area’s African-American residents have a long tradition of fighting back (racism-driven) attempts to prevent their boats from operating independently in public waters. As its conscience, the movie selects Byron Encalade, a third-generation oysterman and president of the Louisiana Oystermen Association, who argues that it’s heritage, not just income, that’s being lost.",0,,,0

In his documentary “Encounters at the End of the World,” this professional madman and restlessly curious filmmaker travels to the blinding white of the Antarctic, where he meets melancholic scientists, brooding journeymen and various poets of the soul who, ensconced in the American headquarters, McMurdo Station,   have traveled so far beyond the familiar coordinates — so far beyond traditional cities, suburbs and banal existence — that they might as well be on another planet.Call it Planet Herzog. Though I’m certain that the men and the smattering of women in the documentary are far from ordinary — their fantastic milieu and haunted eyes suggest as much — part of what makes them memorable is how Mr. Herzog weaves them into his story. And make no mistake: from his familiar droning voice-over to his ethereally lovely images and stubborn fatalism, this is very much Werner Herzog’s story of the Antarctic and  not, as he intimates right up front, a heartfelt tale of “fluffy” penguins, an easy swipe at the palatable pleasures of the documentary “March of the Penguins.” Though there are, as it happens, some penguins here too, most memorably a Herzogean   creature that may trouble your dreams.Like many of Mr. Herzog’s movies, fiction and nonfiction, “Encounters at the End of the World” itself has the quality of a dream: it’s at once vivid and vague, easy to grasp and somehow beyond reach. Its inspiration can be found in his 2005 movie, “The Wild Blue Yonder,” a self-described science fiction fantasy (about outer and inner spaces, for starters) that mixes fiction with nonfiction. Its most striking nonfiction moments come courtesy of the underwater video images shot in the Antarctic by his friend and sometime composer, the guitarist Henry Kaiser, of divers swimming in the eerie blue under a shelf of crystal ice. (Mr. Kaiser produced this new movie and, with David Lindley, did  its plaintive, effective string-centric music.)These same underwater explorers return in “Encounters at the End of the World,” floating in cerulean amid otherworldly creatures, like fuzzy-looking clams that languidly snap open and close like fur castanets and an undulating jellyfish with silvery, near-transparent tentacles and what looks like a raw steak at its center. I could watch these surreal creatures for hours, and from the way he returns to these images, you get the sense that so could Mr. Herzog. But there are other sights and sounds to marvel at,  including  the Weddell seals that loll about indifferently on the surface, soaking up rays like fat, lazy tourists but, once underwater, create a symphony of electronic-like calls that one scientist accurately compares to Pink Floyd.One of the beauties of “Encounters at the End of the World” is that all the furry and floating animals are no more wondrous than the bipeds tramping through and around McMurdo: the linguist turned philosopher, the banker turned bus driver and the female adventurer who, for drama and odd entertainment, likes to have herself zipped up in a carryall bag.  (She’s her own baggage.) Mr. Herzog opens his mind, heart and eyes to all these wayfarers who — despite the persistent strain of melancholy that touches each and every person who appears on camera — seem eerily at peace at the bottom of the world. One reason may be that, like Mr. Herzog, more than a few evince a deep-felt pessimism about both the present and the future.If this were a nature documentary like any other, the casual talk about global warming and other calamities might cast shadows across this bright expanse. But there’s something about Mr. Herzog — including the accidental if now well-practiced comedy that colors even his most dramatic pronouncements — that inevitably keeps his pictures from growing too dark. One reason is beauty, which in his hands has a way of keeping the worst at bay; it is, after all, hard to fully despair in the face of so much of the natural world’s splendors. Another reason, I think, has to do with Mr. Herzog’s seemingly unshakable faith in human beings, who for all their misdeeds at times reach a state of exaltedness. They soar — just like that jellyfish.ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLDOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written, directed and narrated by Werner Herzog; director of photography, Peter Zeitlinger; edited by Joe Bini; music by Henry Kaiser and David Lindley; produced by Mr. Kaiser; released by ThinkFilm.

374,2014-07-11,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell","USA, UK, Canada",Matt Reeves,"Action, Adventure, Drama","English, American Sign Language",79.0,130.0,"Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Rick Jaffa (based on characters created by), Amanda Silver (based on characters created by)",2014,7.6,378487.0,90.0,2017-11-02 04:18:19,A. O. SCOTT, Neighbors Who Need Good Fences,"A quick montage at the beginning of “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” fills us in on what has happened since “Rise of the Planet of the Apes.” Three years have gone by for us in the audience, and about a decade for the assorted primates on the screen. James Franco and millions of other people are dead, victims of a lethal virus and the usual apocalypse-causing disease of hubris. After a period of violence and chaos, the survivors have cobbled together a reasonably stable society in the ruins of San Francisco, with Gary Oldman in charge. But this is not “Dusk of the Planet of the Humans.” The spectacle of yet another desperate population, huddled together in the wake of catastrophe to await the next zombie, alien, robot or monster attack, would be unlikely to inspire much excitement. The real interest lies across the battered Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin County, where our evolutionary cousins, under the benevolent guidance of an upright-walking chimpanzee named Caesar, have built their own civilization. In contrast to the bedraggled human colony, the ape encampment is a thriving city-state with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated (mostly signed) language and an educational system overseen by Maurice, the gentle, copper-furred orangutan who gave the first movie an extra fillip of soul.The sylvan, simian Athens in the Muir Woods is a remarkable achievement and an important part of what makes “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,” directed by Matt Reeves from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback, the best of this summer’s large-scale, big-studio franchise movies. Granted, this isn’t a very high bar to clear: “better than ‘Transformers 4’ ” barely counts as praise, even with an exclamation mark. But unlike that toy-smashing extravaganza — and unlike 2014’s visitations from the “Spider-Man,” “X-Men” and “Godzilla” money trains — “Dawn” is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about.Starting with the apes themselves. In the final credits, Andy Serkis receives top billing for his performance as Caesar, a role that continues to redefine screen acting in the digital age. His facial expressions and body language are so evocatively and precisely rendered that it is impossible to say where his art ends and the exquisite artifice of Weta Digital, the special-effects company, begins. The same is true of the other main ape performers: Karin Konoval (Maurice); Nick Thurston (Caesar’s son Blue Eyes); Judy Greer (Caesar’s wife, Cornelia); and especially Toby Kebbell as Koba, Caesar’s lieutenant and eventual nemesis.Koba, a survivor of scientific experiments, bears the physical and moral scars of human cruelty. When the apes encounter a scouting party from the city (led by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell), Koba is quick to sound the alarm. The humans, about to run out of fuel, want to restore an abandoned hydroelectric station in ape territory, and they ask Caesar for help. Koba warns that people are a violent, duplicitous, predatory species that should be fought if it can’t be avoided. Caesar, who saw the generous, tender side of humanity when he was hanging out with Mr. Franco and Freida Pinto, is willing to give our kind the benefit of the doubt. There is plenty of evidence — both in the movie and beyond it — to support Koba’s view, but the film comes down squarely, and maybe a little too squishily, on the side of tolerance and cooperation. The ape and human societies are parallel primitive patriarchies (women nurture and worry, while men lead and fight, a disappointing but hardly surprising failure of imagination on the filmmakers’ part), and they are threatened by symmetrical schisms. As Koba opposes Caesar, so does Malcolm (Mr. Clarke’s character) find himself increasingly at odds with Dreyfus (Mr. Oldman), who sees the apes as a mortal threat to be confronted with maximum brutality.The arguments — in essence, about whether the boundaries of solidarity should stay within the tribe or extend beyond it — give “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” a nice allegorical heft. The old movies, which blew the minds and troubled the sleep of many children in the ’60s and ’70s (including young Bobby Draper in Season 6 of “Mad Men”), arrived at a time of racial conflict, ecological anxiety and a general sense of social breakdown. Since then, cinematic technology has evolved from rubber masks to digital sculpture, and our fears and aspirations have mutated, too, making “Planet of the Apes” a less abstract, more hauntingly immediate story.And while “Rise” found room for exuberance in the shadow of catastrophe — partly because it seemed so justifiably excited by its own ingenuity — “Dawn,” its title notwithstanding, paints a darker, scarier picture of the future. It also has a grave, brooding beauty, intensified by Michael Giacchino’s wild and subtle score and by the deep, verdant shadows of Michael Seresin’s cinematography. Mr. Reeves has a fine sense of visual detail and also of the eloquence of nonverbal exchanges between characters, digitally enhanced and otherwise. (Ms. Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee, as her adolescent son, do especially graceful work in limited roles.) The film is full of small, memorable moments and crowded with distinctive personalities on both sides of the ape-human divide. In other words, it’s a satisfying movie and an example — a dispiritingly rare one these days — of what mainstream Hollywood filmmaking can still achieve. That we have progressed from “Rise” only as far as “Dawn” suggests many future sequels, which may, in this case, be a source of hope as well as dread, provided that civilization doesn’t collapse in the meantime. “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

375,2014-03-28,Hide Your Smiling Faces,"Ryan Jones, Nathan Varnson, Colm O'Leary, Thomas Cruz",USA,Daniel Patrick Carbone,Drama,English,69.0,81.0,Daniel Patrick Carbone (screenplay),2013,6.1,1452.0,83.0,2017-11-02 04:18:18,STEPHEN HOLDEN,A Boyhood Summer of Darkness,"Daniel Patrick Carbone’s haunting debut feature, “Hide Your Smiling Faces,” evokes a semi-rural 1950s America in which packs of neighborhood boys pass the time riding bikes, exploring the woods and engaging in ritualistic roughhouse games. The mood of the film, shot in areas of Sussex County, N.J., suggests a darker reflection of the same vision of boyhood adventure depicted in Terrence Malick’s “The Tree of Life.” Although the time feels like the 1950s, the appearance of a portable DVD player signals that it is set more or less in the present.As the local boys (there are no girls) explore the natural world in summer, this gorgeously photographed movie bombards you with imagined scents of ripeness and decay. The sounds of nature, combined with a spare and vaguely ominous electronic soundtrack, add enough atmosphere to augment an acute awareness of the great outdoors as a wild kingdom fraught with peril.Because the boys are left to their own devices during the day, and the adults remain in the background except at mealtimes, “Hide Your Smiling Faces” conveys life as the boys experience it: a pungent mixture of boredom, curiosity, fear and mischievousness, along with an anxious sense of being trapped.What little story exists focuses on Eric (Nathan Varnson), who is 14, and his 9-year-old sibling, Tommy (Ryan Jones), whom he bullies the way older brothers often do. In one of many challenges, Eric forces Tommy to learn to swim by carrying him into deep water and letting go, while Tommy howls with fear. Eric, driven by an inchoate rage and frustration he can barely express, is a little scary, because you sense that his impulse toward cruelty could tip over the line at any second. Their intimacy at certain moments feels almost stifling, as if they were physically conjoined.The main event of the summer is the death of a playmate, Ian (Ivan Tomic), a boy Tommy’s age whose body is found at the foot of a bridge. Did he jump, or did he fall? The movie doesn’t say. But in an early scene, Ian proudly brings his father’s loaded gun out of a barn to show Eric and Tommy, and the boys struggle for it. Before the gun can discharge, Ian’s father (Colm O’Leary) furiously rushes out of the house and scolds Ian, who runs into the woods while the brothers scatter. That gun (or another like it) reappears several more times. Whenever it does, you worry that someone will be shot.The subject of death comes up frequently in the boys’ idle conversations, and at times the dialogue sounds a little ham-handed. But it is the vision of the natural world in which the brothers cavort that lends “Hide Your Smiling Faces” much of its gravity. The opening image of a snake with a fish in its mouth begins a procession that includes a dead bird and the discovery of a dead raccoon, which Eric sets on fire. While wandering through the woods late in the movie, Eric encounters a brown bear. He pets the creature before both go their separate ways. By the end of “Hide Your Smiling Faces,” these boys of summer have blended so thoroughly with their environment that they seem inseparable from the rest of the wildlife.",1,,,0

Tolkien (novel)",2013,7.9,549627.0,75.0,2017-11-02 04:18:18,MANOHLA DARGIS,In the Middle of Middle-earth,"At the start of “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,” the second part of Peter Jackson’s extended-play adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s children’s book, Bilbo Baggins has a sword called Sting and One Ring to Rule Them All — eventually. We have a ways to go. As everyone on Earth and in Middle-earth surely knows, Mr. Jackson, having turned Tolkien’s trilogy “The Lord of the Rings” into three hit films, has given its prequel a blockbuster do-over in three separate 3-D movies. The first, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” a soporific 170 minutes released in 2012, lived up to its subtitle principally by moving at a snail’s pace. At 161 minutes the new one by contrast feels like a sprint. (The third, “The Hobbit: There and Back Again,” is set for world domination in December 2014.) Once again, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo, the homebody hobbit who has been enlisted by a band of boisterous dwarfs to help reclaim their lost kingdom and vast treasure from a gold-stoned dragon, Smaug, voiced with hypnotic, sepulchral menace by Benedict Cumberbatch. (The casting for Bilbo and Smaug constitutes a reunion of sorts because Mr. Cumberbatch plays, dazzlingly, Holmes on the BBC television show “Sherlock,” in which Mr. Freeman holds the center as Watson.) When the movie opens, Bilbo, the dwarfs and the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), are closing in on Smaug, who lords over the lost dwarf kingdom in Lonely Mountain. Having endured loads of trouble in the first movie — lions, tigers and bears, or rather trolls, orcs and stone giants — the travelers are in for more.And how: Mr. Jackson, like many contemporary directors given enormous resources to play with, likes to pile it on. With “The Desolation of Smaug,” he has taken roughly five chapters from the middle of Tolkien’s book and turned them into a relentless adventure tale, teaming with rowdy action, slavering enemies and Elven gymnastics. (It was written by Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro.) There are giant spiders, wolves called Wargs and one pleasingly familiar face, that of Legolas, the Elven heartthrob played by Orlando Bloom, who swoops into the mix and, like Luke Evans, as a mystery man named Bard, gives the movie some oomph. There’s also the skin-changer, Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), who divertingly transforms from man to beast and gives Bilbo and company shelter.There’s more, much more, including a layover in the Elven kingdom, where the imperious Elvenking, Thranduil (Lee Pace), gads about in flowing robes and locks like a petulant supermodel. He’s a bore and a drag — he imprisons the dwarfs and whines constantly — but Legolas, with his darting moves, is a delight, as is another Elven warrior, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). A filmmaker invention, Tauriel was created to femme up the nearly all-male world of the “Hobbit” and is one of the better realized and welcome liberties taken with a book that Tolkien, who fought and studied among men, wrote between the two world wars. So it’s irritating that she’s saddled with a romance, a pandering turn that suggests Mr. Jackson, unlike his female fans, can’t even imagine a woman without a man.It isn’t that the romance is badly handled: it actually creates a bit of a breather and shines some light into a galumphing, often grim movie. Rather, it’s the conventionality, the lack of surprise and poverty of imagination that’s gone into the creation of the only woman in the movie with an active, substantive role and which speaks to Mr. Jackson’s weaknesses as a director. Because when he is good — as in the first “Lord of the Rings” and in scenes here and there in its sequels and in this movie — he is very, very good. But when he is bad he’s a crushingly straight, unoriginal director who seems largely interested in topping himself with bigger, louder, more frenetic action and who all too often hits his beats as predictably as someone doing hack work for Jerry Bruckheimer. The good Mr. Jackson dukes it out with the bad throughout “The Desolation of Smaug.” There are, once again, too many busy, uninterestingly staged battles that lean heavily on obvious, sometimes distracting digital sorcery. But there are also pacific, brooding interludes in which the actors — notably Mr. Freeman, an intensely appealing screen presence — remind you that there’s more to Middle-earth than clamor and struggle. “They were come to the Desolation of the Dragon,” Tolkien writes partway through “The Hobbit,” in a line that conveys the stateliness of purpose of Bilbo’s journey and its foreboding, “and they were come at the waning of the year.” For a few pleasurable moments, Mr. Jackson pauses at the edge of this poetic cliffhanger — and then barrels right over. “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

From the moment his legs gave way during a 2006 Caribbean vacation, to the film’s improbably upbeat 2012 conclusion, Mr. DaSilva, a successful documentary filmmaker and just 25 when he received his diagnosis, ruthlessly chronicled his dismayingly rapid decline.Astonishingly, this is neither as depressing nor as arm-twistingly uplifting as you might expect. Mr. DaSilva’s experience behind a camera shows in his brisk pacing, clear narrative structure and the awareness that a story of sickness needs lighthearted distractions. So when he travels to India to work on another film project, and is too debilitated to finish, he cheerfully experiments with alternative therapies for his disease. And when the use of a wheelchair becomes unavoidable, he channels his frustration with New York City’s lack of ramps and subway elevators into developing a mobile application to chart disability-friendly businesses and services.Fueled by its maker’s uncompromising intelligence and unrelenting candor, “When I Walk” is also indebted to two women: Mr. DaSilva’s fiercely indomitable mother — whose no-whining policy can seem at times a little heartless — and the lovely Alice Cook, whose joy and anguish over her flowering relationship with Mr. DaSilva occasion some of the film’s most genuinely moving moments. Forced to become her partner’s eyes and hands, Ms. Cook displays a bravery and vulnerability every bit as impressive as Mr. DaSilva’s own.",1,,,0

In “Dealin’ With Idiots,” which he also directed, Mr. Garlin surrounds himself with a quirky, seemingly improvisational ensemble of comic actors (in the manner of, say, Christopher Guest’s usual players) to lampoon the obsessions of adults with children on a baseball team. The results are amusing if predictably mild.Mr. Garlin, playing a comedian, wants to gather material by recording interviews with the parents and coaches, and off he goes to their homes and workplaces. Richard Kind, a “Curb” alumnus, portrays a dim, harried husband. Bob Odenkirk, the officious coach, has a day job at a Kinko’s-like place, while J B Smoove, as his assistant, is a smooth operator in constant pursuit of sexual prey. Steve Agee (from “The Sarah Silverman Program”) is a suspicious, short-fused dad, and Fred Willard (from the Guest troupe) does his usual blustery, sanctimonious shtick. Intriguing but largely unexplored are a lesbian couple played by Gina Gershon and Kerri Kenney-Silver (from “Reno 911!”).Mr. Garlin has such a soft touch that at times the film feels feather-light, almost devoid of emotional traction. The suburban, sun-saturated Los Angeles ambience contributes a sense of anomie, which is reinforced by static moments following a joke (presumably to be filled by audience laughter). But as cable fodder on a steamy summer afternoon, “Dealin’ With Idiots” should be more than sufficient.",0,,,1

(She had strong ideas about cricket.) And in flashbacks to their childhood in Mumbai, they shared a knack for mischievously, yet ingenuously, testing the patience of their parents. There’s no doubt that they — in this case, Nikhil — will spend the entire movie fighting what the audience already knows is their destiny.While the film starts out as a seemingly fresh take on the romantic comedy, it is saddled with numerous contrivances and the clichéd trappings of the genre: big weddings, wayward souls and quick-to-judge elders. Mr. Malhotra fares well as the pragmatic Nikhil, and Ms. Chopra shines despite the material.It’s the treatment of her character, however, that is the biggest disappointment. Instead of heralding Meeta’s initial nerdy quirkiness, the filmmakers turn her into a twitchy, blinking, prescription-drug-fueled hypocrite who extols a live-for-the-moment mantra but is afraid to face her own family and mistakes.

SCOTT,Review: Salma Hayek Skewers a Boor in ‘Beatriz at Dinner’,"The hopeless polarization of American society is both a truism and a taboo. We may be divided by class, race, ideology and any number of other forces, but many of us also cling to the belief — or the delusion — that a larger consensus still holds us together. Failing that, we can at least still be nice to one another when the occasion requires. Can’t we?“Beatriz at Dinner,” a new film directed by Miguel Arteta and written by Mike White, unflinchingly addresses that question, and declines to provide a comforting answer. The setting is a dinner party at a Southern California mansion made awkward by the presence of the title character, a massage therapist played with regal composure and understated mischief by Salma Hayek. The differences of background and economic status between Beatriz and her hosts are obvious enough, and the film hardly ignores them. But this is neither a simple satire of privilege nor a mock-provocative comedy of diversity and its discontents. It’s about a clash of values, about unresolvable contradictions. Or to put it another way, about good and evil.Beatriz, who lives with dogs and goats and who works mainly with cancer patients at an alternative-healing center, is undoubtedly good. But because she is a Mike White heroine, she is also complicated, sometimes abrasive and not always pleasant to be around. She demonstrates obvious kinship with the characters played by Molly Shannon in “Year of the Dog” (which Mr. White wrote and directed) and Laura Dern in the HBO series “Enlightened” (which he created). Her righteousness doesn’t make her saintly. It makes her interesting.The same word could apply to her nemesis and dinner-party sparring partner, a rich and powerful real estate developer with the slightly too on-the-nose name of Doug Strutt. Played with almost indecent relish by John Lithgow, Strutt has the smile of a cat who swallows a bushel of canaries at every meal. He is a big-game hunter and an all-around winner at the game of life, for whom money and wives (he’s with his third, Jeana, played by Amy Landecker) are signs of achieved destiny. He’s boorish, blustery and also charming in his way. And while he and Beatriz have nothing in common, each can lay claim to a kind of integrity, an honest view of the world and their existence in it.The rest of the company is more ordinary — nice people, hypocrites, unable to comprehend the moral conflict raging in front of them. The hostess, Kathy (Connie Britton), who sincerely regards Beatriz as a friend, had insisted, over the objections of her husband, Grant (David Warshofsky), on including Beatriz after her car broke down in Kathy and Grant’s driveway. Grant is a business partner of Doug’s, involved in a deal that also includes Alex (Jay Duplass) who arrives with his wife, Shannon (Chloë Sevigny). Small talk is made and decorum is observed, until Beatriz figures out who Doug is and decides to confront him.Mr. Arteta — who collaborated with Mr. White on “Chuck and Buck” (2000) and “The Good Girl” (2002), and whose other films include “Youth in Revolt” and “Cedar Rapids” — doesn’t push the evening toward melodrama or farce. He directs with a dry, Buñuelian touch, savoring small absurdities and letting the larger themes hover in the soft Orange County air. It’s up to Beatriz to bring them up, to spoil the party and bring the movie to life.The seriousness of its themes in no way detracts from the delight in watching Ms. Hayek and Mr. Lithgow perform their eccentric, intricate dance. Their commitment to the idiosyncrasy and unpredictability of their characters creates an unusual kind of suspense, a slightly uncomfortable kind of increased alertness. Where will this argument go next? How will it end?Not well, unfortunately. I don’t mean that something terrible happens, but rather that the filmmakers don’t quite succeed in bringing their story to a credible conclusion. But having said that, I have to admit that I have no idea what such a thing might look like. “Beatriz at Dinner” is about unresolvable contradictions, after all, which may mean that its failures are less specific than systemic. I don’t blame Mr. White or Mr. Arteta. I blame capitalism. I blame America.",0,7115001.0,7115854.0,0

(As a former Chicagoan, I’ll confess to some affection for the location, around the corner from the city’s main screening room for movie critics.)There, Cassidy (Virginia Kull), an aspiring actress with no real prospects, takes a job as a courier for Barry (Ed Begley Jr.), a diamond importer who is seeing Cassidy’s mother (Marilu Henner). The job requires Cassidy to carry diamonds to nearby stores. The theory is that security firms get robbed; an ordinary woman on the street will not. And if she does get robbed, Alex (Ashton Holmes), Barry’s son, tells her, the business has insurance. Since they are both broke, the temptations are obvious.Mr. Singer, who wrote, directed and scored the film, mines a fair amount of comedy from Cassidy’s attempts to recruit an accomplice, Ray (Zach McGowan), her ex and a former drug dealer who, unfortunately for her and Alex, has embarked on a period of self-improvement.The characters’ musings about regrets — life is imperfect, you see — seem superfluous, the byproducts of an overwritten screenplay. Most of the movie’s pleasures come from Ms. Kull, a better actress than the one she plays, and the convolutions of the plot, which has a few good feints and dodges.",0,,,1

Space Cowboy Rides to the Rescue,"Talking about directing in blockbusters is sometimes nothing more than wishful thinking. Most are such impersonally operated machines — dedicated to the business of brand storytelling — that they tend to obliterate any whisper of individuality. That there’s a palpable directorial sensibility in “Guardians of the Galaxy,” along with other signs of genuine life, helps separate this latest Marvel cash grab from a lot of off-the-rack movie cartoons. Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats. Lifted by a cast of professional charmers and a “What, me worry?” vibe, “Guardians of the Galaxy” is one of those interstellar westerns about a motley group of appealing baddies who rise to the heroic occasion and ride to the rescue, on spaceships rather than Appaloosas. The John Wayne role here — or, really, the 1970s Harrison Ford one — belongs to Chris Pratt, an easygoing, comic performer who’s very good at putting up a persuasive cute-dumb front and then shifting into a slyer, more knowing register. Wearing a swinging duster and some fetishistic head gear, Mr. Pratt slides into “Guardians of the Galaxy” doing a Gene Kelly soft shoe, but is soon flexing his action-hero bona fides (bang-bang, etc.) as Peter Quill, a heavily armed professional scavenger.Quill is a good and a sometimes bad guy who fights and jokes amid swirling, polychromatic smoke and cascading words like Xandarians, Morag and the Celestial (and awesome) Head. He comes into possession of a pretty blue rock that everyone would risk death trying to get, hence a throwaway about “The Maltese Falcon.” You see, in 1539, some crusading knights persuaded the king of Spain to give them the island of Malta. ... That’s not what happens in “Guardians,” which is based on a comic that first hit in 1969, but no matter. What counts are the dreams of Quill and his compatriots, including a wisecracking raccoon and an ambulatory tree, which have been ushered into existence by the director, James Gunn, with an eye to those who don’t know or care about the source material.In other words, you don’t need to be held hostage by the Marvel Weltanschauung to enjoy “Guardians.” The story may be confusing and generic by turns, but if you shake off the bonds of narrative coherency it’s liberating letting the weird words — Yondu, Necrocraft, Sakkaran — just slide right past you, much like the zigzagging, exploding 3-D spaceships. What sticks are the fantastical landscapes, the beautiful creature designs and the actors delivering lively performances, even with strata of makeup and digital wizardry. Among the many amusements is the floating head (kind of like in “The Wizard of Oz”) that yells at a villain, Ronan (Lee Pace, with notes of “Star Wars” and “Prometheus”) who wants the blue rock so he can destroy Xandar, a post-racial Eden run by Nova Prime, a space-age Hillary Rodham Clinton (Glenn Close).Filled with a multihued populace, Xandar is shiny, clean and bright, and looks familiar because it evokes both our world (one building suggests the Gherkin in London) and your favorite tattered science-fiction paperback. It’s nice if a little ho-hum (as utopias tend to be in movies), particularly when compared with the darkly colored, visually seductive realms and spaces conjured up by Mr. Gunn and his team. From location to location, and character to character, the quality of the special effects meets the demands of the imaginative designs in sweep and detail. There are different ways to get lost in a movie, and while “Guardians” takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into — and, for the most part, keeps you in — a fully realized other world. That’s a relief, because the movie doesn’t start promisingly, opening with not one but two female clichés: the dead mother and the disposable chick. Both belong to Quill — he tells the chick, who enters with bed hair and not much else, that he forgot she was even there — and they suggest that however futuristic the movie may be, its sexual politics and worldview are antediluvian. (You have to wonder if the people who make these entertainments ever think about what such tired stereotypes say to young viewers, not to mention their own sons and daughters.) The sense that the movie’s appealingly old-fashioned jocularity, reminiscent of late Howard Hawks, has its fatal drawbacks dissipates with the introduction of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green, mean, not-so-jolly killing machine.However familiar, Gamora turns out to be better than most Strong Female Characters — you know those girls: They’re fierce and finally inconsequential — that the blogger Tasha Robinson went after in a recent post about the so-called Trinity Syndrome. This pervasive sexist disorder affects a lot of filmmakers and is named for the “Matrix” character whose trajectory doesn’t deliver on her exciting promise. Gamora is given more to do than make a splashy entrance and wear tight costumes, and Ms. Saldana remains a charismatic screen presence, even when she trades in her Emma Peel-ish catsuits for a miniskirt, a costume change that’s accompanied by the image of a soft female hand resting on a strong male shoulder. This is another movie that mock-skewers the stereotypes it embraces.It’s old news that the major studios, having long absorbed the lessons of B-movie titans like Roger Corman, are now primarily in the business of churning out big-ticket exploitation flicks. (As a studio executive said way back in 1975, “What was ‘Jaws’ but an old Corman monster-from-the-deep flick?”) It’s perfect, then, that Mr. Gunn, having started out working for Troma Entertainment, that gleeful purveyor of barrel-scraping trash, has been tapped by Marvel for its latest bid at box-office domination. He’s a funny guy who brings a light touch to cartoon violence, whether he’s going for giggles (as in “Slither”) or uglier yuks (“Super”). But in “Guardians of the Galaxy,” he also summons up some emotion and even quiet desperation amid the scares and the brutes like Drax (a terrific Dave Bautista). Given these moments of feeling, it doesn’t seem accidental that two of the brightest characters in the movie, which Mr. Gunn wrote with Nicole Perlman, are the raccoon and the tree, both surprisingly melancholic figures whose presence proves more resonant than their patter. The raccoon, Rocket (given an effectively grating screech by Bradley Cooper), is a nasty, often crude piece of work who’s never as funny as he thinks. But, much like the tree, a gorgeously rendered creature called Groot (Vin Diesel, in his finest role since “The Iron Giant”) — who nibbles his own tender sprouts and, in a nod to the 1931 film “Frankenstein,” offers a child a bloom — the raccoon carries with him an air of regret, a sense of loss and despair that, in the end, speaks more to our world than to that of the movie. “Guardians of the Galaxy” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The directorial debut of Helen Hunt, who plays April Epner, an anxious 39-year-old kindergarten teacher in New York City, it has all the ingredients of a slick, commercial farce, which it emphatically is not.In fact, the movie, based on a novel by Elinor Lipman, has enough material for two such farces. In one, a childless mother obsessed with her ticking biological clock becomes pregnant after clumsy breakup sex with her husband of less than a year. (Her obstetrician is played by, of all people, Salman Rushdie.) In the other, a woman who has just lost her adoptive mother is suddenly besieged by a garrulous local talk-show personality who claims to be her biological mother.The movie is unusually sensitive to the anxieties around adoption. Shortly before her death, April’s ailing mother (Lynn Cohen) argues that there is no difference between raising an adopted child and one of your own; her daughter should cease fretting and adopt a Chinese baby, she declares. April’s vehement refusal to consider the possibility rings as a tacit insult to her mother’s parenting skills, but the simmering conflict is never brought into the open.Ms. Hunt takes every opportunity to avoid easy comic shtick and cutesy-poo sentimentality in an effort to make her characters act and sound like real people. Where typical Hollywood comedies erase ethnicity, Ms. Hunt emphasizes  her characters’ various shades of Jewishness. April doesn’t seem especially religious, but in the opening scene she goes through a Jewish wedding ceremony with her childish husband, Ben (Matthew Broderick), who goes to live with his mother after their breakup. “Then She Found Me” also clearly indicates that the characters’ lifestyles are not unrealistically comfortable.All the stars, including Ms. Hunt, are pointedly deglamorized. April, alarmingly gaunt, with straining neck tendons, appears to wear little or no makeup. As her biological mother, Bernice Graves, Bette Midler is a blowsy, plump loudmouth and bottle redhead whose obsequious behavior makes much of what she says sound false. Indeed some of it is. In her first of several lies, she claims that April was conceived in a delirious one-night stand with Steve McQueen and relinquished for adoption after three days.April’s would-be romantic savior, Frank (Colin Firth), the recently divorced father of two children (one is  April’s pupil), looks as if  he is going to seed. Spluttering, neurotic and hot-tempered, he has all the romantic promise of an over-the-hill Lancelot astride a tottering nag. Frank also lives in a seedy suburban neighborhood far from any center of action. Mr. Broderick’s Ben is a bloated, inarticulate man-child. His two awkward sex scenes with Ms. Hunt (one in the back seat of a car) are desperate, joyless quickies that involve minimal undressing and leave April confused and Ben apologetic.It falls to Ms. Hunt to stir these character types and clichéd situations into a palatable stew of genuine human emotions.  As April cautiously makes her way, you can feel Ms. Hunt, both as director and actor, discarding sitcom conventions to shoot for something deeper and truer. And she achieves it, mostly through the shaded performances of Mr. Firth and Ms. Midler, as well as her own.Mr. Firth’s Frank is hyper-emotional to a degree rarely seen in male characters in mainstream movies. When Frank gets upset, which is frequently, his face reddens, he bluntly speaks his mind and he often excuses himself to go for a walk and let off steam. Ms. Midler’s Bernice is a credible portrait of a narcissistic drama queen with a good heart  beneath her celebrity bluster.Connections between the characters deepen in spite of misunderstandings and obstacles. After April and Frank acknowledge their mutual attraction, their wary courtship proceeds in fits and starts, but they keep at it. Life isn’t easy for April as she muddles along, but you feel she is headed in the right direction.“Then She Found Me” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some strong language and sexual situations.THEN SHE FOUND MEOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Helen Hunt; written by Alice Arlen, Victor Levin and Ms. Hunt, based on the novel by Elinor Lipman; director of photography, Peter Donahue; edited by Pam Wise; music by David Mansfield; production designer, Stephen Beatrice; produced by Pam Koffler, Katie Roumel, Christine Vachon, Connie Tavel and Ms. Hunt; released by ThinkFilm.

The film carries a trace of the sweep of a great screen epic along with the straightforward, explanatory qualities of mass-audience TV, and is never less than absorbing.Smoothly interweaving the perspectives of British rulers at the viceroy’s house in Delhi and those of their Indian staff, it offers a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the motives of Lord Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville), Britain’s last viceroy to colonial India, who oversaw the transfer of power. That process is still hotly debated: The partition of India, which created an independent India and Pakistan, led to the displacement of more than 10 million people and mass carnage in the resulting violence.Gurinder Chadha, the British-raised director of “Bend It Like Beckham,” closes the film with an ode to her grandmother, who sought refuge from Pakistan in India. As its personal entry point, the film offers a love story between Jeet (Manish Dayal), a Hindu who works as one of Mountbatten’s servants, and Aalia (Huma Qureshi), a Muslim who is betrothed to someone else and may end up on the opposite side of a new border.Famous figures — including Mohandas K.

Partly inspired by George Prochnik’s 2010 book of the same title, this elegant sermon by Patrick Shen on why we should dial down the racket of our daily lives will make you consider turning off and tuning out.Gathering academics, audiologists and other experts who share his anticacophony view, Mr. Shen aims to show that excessive sound can negatively affect our bodies as well as our minds. His style is compare-and-contrast: rural versus urban, the natural world versus the electronic and synthetic. Tranquil scenes from an Iowa monastery and a national park give way jarringly to the metallic din in a subway station and the deafening clamor of a restaurant. A visit to Mumbai (believed to be the noisiest city in the world) will leave your ears ringing.Shot over two years and in eight countries, the movie has a quirky lightness that prevents it from slipping into lecture. Its arguments range wide without going deep, but its factoids about the medical benefits of hanging out in a forest — and the cognitive costs of a noisy school or hospital — are fascinating and persuasive.At times, the film’s insistence on linking the silent to the sacred can border on preachy. But then we check in with Greg Hindy, a stoic searcher who stopped talking for a year while he walked across the United States.

SCOTT,"Mend Your Foolish Ways, Would-Be Church Bandits","Ice Cube’s recent movie roles, in the “Barbershop” and “Are We There Yet?” franchises, have emphasized his cuddly, family-man side. In “First Sunday,” which is not  a new installment in the earlier “Friday” series, he departs a bit from the upright-citizen persona, playing a man driven to crime by desperate circumstances.But “First Sunday,” the first   theatrically released feature film written and directed by David E. Talbert, is a comedy. Like Tyler Perry, Mr. Talbert has had a successful —  and to the white media, nearly invisible —  career as a playwright and theatrical entrepreneur, and his movie debut fuses social observation and raucous, clean humor with a message of redemption.Ice Cube, not exactly a mirthful performer, requires an antic sidekick, and he has a pretty good one here in Tracy Morgan. Mr. Morgan plays LeeJohn, the feckless stoner half of a hapless pair of robbers. Durell, Ice Cube’s character, is the more  practical half of the team. Because he needs $17,000 to prevent his ex-girlfriend from moving with their son from Baltimore to Atlanta, Durell decides to rob a church.What kind of person would rob a church? This question occupies most of the movie’s slow, talky middle third, in which an easy in-and-out safecracking scheme turns into a hostage drama. Durell and LeeJohn’s captives include the wise pastor (Chi McBride); his pretty, headstrong daughter (Malinda Williams); a shifty deacon (Michael Beach) and the flamboyantly queeny choir director (Katt Williams), among other easily recognizable church-movie stock figures.Mr.  Williams pretty much steals the movie by rolling his eyes and muttering under his breath. And if Mr. Talbert does not quite manage the shift in tone from rambunctious comedy to earnest uplift, he is nonetheless generous with both the characters and the audience. “First Sunday” sometimes feels more like a script read-through than like an actual movie, but its warmth is likely to carry you through the stretches of cliché and tedium.“First Sunday” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

389,2017-04-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-04-06 16:44:02,GLENN KENNY,Review: Al Pacino’s Journey With Wilde’s ‘Salomé’,"During the opening titles of “Wilde Salomé,” it announces itself as “a story about an obsession.” Early on in the documentary chronicling both a film and a theater production of the Oscar Wilde play, Estelle Parsons, the great actor, asks Al Pacino, the great actor who’s instigating the productions: “Why ‘Salomé’? You’ve done it! You not only did it once, you’ve done it twice. How many productions have you done?”Perhaps one reason Mr. Pacino is so dogged in his explorations of the play is because it’s one that few others would think to cast him in. The lead male role, that of Herod, a king who promises the title character anything if she will dance for him, is a meaty one, to be sure. But even more than that of the title character, a royal daughter who is determined to kiss the mouth of John the Baptist even if that requires his decapitation, Herod as a character is a figure balanced on the knife edge of Camp. And if there’s one mode of art that contemporary directors do not associate with Mr. Pacino, it’s Camp. (At least with intentional Camp.)Which is not to say that Mr. Pacino interprets the character in an entirely uncharacteristic fashion. And I don’t think that at any point in the documentary he even brings up Camp. But he does give Herod a fey, pansexually flirtatious side that one doesn’t normally associate with Mr. Pacino, who, in most performances, whether quiet or manic, is almost always masculine in a conventionally unambiguous way.How his approach to the character works is answered by “Salomé,” the film. In a feat of artistic derring-do, while Mr. Pacino was acting in a Los Angeles theater production of the play directed by Ms. Parsons, he was himself directing a film version of the play on a nearby movie-studio soundstage. Mr. Pacino’s documentary chronicles the feat; “Salomé” the movie shows the results of one of his efforts.Mr. Pacino’s interpretation of the character is not ineffectual, and it finds its match in a Salomé played by Jessica Chastain, appearing several years before she achieved screen stardom. Their exchanges, and the exchanges between Ms. Chastain’s Salomé and Kevin Anderson’s John the Baptist, are frequently shot in close-up. The concentration of the performers and the power of Wilde’s unusually baroque, even for him, language (he originally composed the play in French, as it happens) makes for some mesmerizing scenes. But whenever Mr. Pacino cuts away from these performers, a connection is severed. The viewer is made too privy to how, in this rendering, Mr. Pacino suspends the work uneasily between theater and cinema.In the documentary, there’s a scene in which Mr. Pacino opens a newspaper and sees an ad for the theatrical production blaring “Pacino Is Back.” He is immediately put off. “You know, this is the problem,” he says. “This is the problem with my whole life.” The movie never addresses it quite so explicitly, but “Wilde Salomé” is most fascinating as a portrait of a superstar actor who, for all his wealth and privilege, encounters unusual frustrations as he pursues genuine artistic ambitions.By the same token, though, not a lot of documentarians out there have the name-recognition clout to attract Tom Stoppard, Gore Vidal, Tony Kushner and, yes, Ireland’s Artistic Ambassador to the World, Bono, to weigh in on Oscar Wilde for them.Mr. Pacino clashes with Ms. Parsons, with his movie producers and others. While much of the offstage drama has an authentic tartness, some of it feels manufactured, as in a scene at the movie’s end that depicts Mr. Pacino asserting his aforementioned clout to get something the viewer has been persuaded to believe he will be denied. He becomes his own King Herod in a sense. The weird power dynamics at play throughout are almost as fascinating as the play with which Mr. Pacino professes to be obsessed.",1,,,0

He has said that this script sat dormant for 45 years. Realizing such a long-deferred passion project would be an accomplishment for anyone. Still, it’s hard to ignore that the harshly lit digital cinematography and the acting styles seem wildly out of step with the period, or that Mr. Sanders often clumsily frames his shots — with his lens in his performers’ faces — to hide contemporary backdrops.“Liza, Liza” is mostly so familiar — a standard teenage-lovers-on-the-lam tale — that it could have been set anywhere. With her boyfriend, Brett (Sean H. Scully), about to move East, Liza (Mikey Madison) runs away with him on a motorcycle trip up Big Sur. There are some signs of the times, including a druggy love-in, references to the draft, a roving gang of vaguely Mansonish thugs and a repeated Buffy Sainte-Marie song. But the question of whether the couple will consummate their relationship isn’t a sufficient source of tension.",0,,,0

As the title character in “Maleficent” — a divertingly different rethink of an awfully old story — she breezes through the movie, part superstar, part superfreak. Her red mouth slashes across the screen while her clothes billow like storm clouds, her body framed by enormous shimmering wings and her head capped by a pair of majestic horns. The wings allow her to soar, but the horns mainly give her character a distinctly Freudian kink, some phallic enhancement to go with the fairy tale enchantment. And, my, what big horns they are. She wears them like a crown in this live-action postscript to the visually stunning 1959 Disney animated musical “Sleeping Beauty.” This time, the focus isn’t on the beautiful, blond Aurora, who falls into a deep, bewitched sleep after pricking her finger on a spindle, but rather on the sinister scene stealer who cursed her in a fit of pique and a puff of acid-green smoke. As it turns out, Maleficent (it rhymes with magnificent) had her reasons and a back story to go with them. Soothingly introduced in voice-over by Janet McTeer, Maleficent’s story opens when she was a happy young fairy (Isobelle Molloy and Ella Purnell) living in, and flying over, the moors, a lush, computer-generated wonderland populated by cute uglies and delicately mossy, twiggy giants.Trouble enters in the form of a human boy, Stefan, a farmhand who’s caught pilfering a stone, a seemingly small act that reverberates as loudly as Klaxon horns. Maleficent forgives him; a friendship is born; time rushes by — it’s obvious that the filmmakers can’t wait to bring in Ms. Jolie — and the friendship evolves into a puppyish romance, sealed with a kiss. Stefan seems nice enough, if bland, and he’s played first by Michael Higgins and then, briefly, by Jackson Bews. Before long, though, Ms. Jolie has taken to the skies while, back in the human realm, Sharlto Copley has brought the adult Stefan ploddingly, disappointingly down to earth. Casting is destiny in a lot of movies; one look at the twitchy, shifty-eyed adult Stefan, and it’s clear that Mr. Copley won’t be continuing the romance.He doesn’t. Instead, he betrays Maleficent and, in one of the movie’s muddled sections, helps wage war against her land. Her wings literally clipped, Maleficent retreats into her dark place like a grounded Valkyrie, casting shadows over her world to go with her mood. Stefan assumes the throne and, years later, he and his forgettable queen have a child, Aurora. At this point, the filmmakers pick up the “Sleeping Beauty” thread and begin weaving it into Maleficent’s story, so, again, there are a christening and a curse, and Aurora is squired away by a troika of pixies (a tolerably amusing Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville and Juno Temple), who raise her in a forest cottage. There, she grows up (and eventually into Elle Fanning) under the gaze of Maleficent, which is where this rethink gets going.In broad strokes, “Maleficent” is Disney’s latest bid to recast a dusty story for a contemporary audience, one that has, over the years, complained with good reason about the company’s representations, particularly of female characters. For decades, Disney has responded with an array of plucky girls and women whose desires extend beyond romantic longing. Usually, they have adventures, and not just dreams, to go with their wasp waists and froufrou. Sometimes they save the day and their true love, which is better and more fun than waiting to be saved. Yet Disney heroines, whether princesses or not, have almost always ended up as reliably paired off as if they were boarding Noah’s ark. A notable exception is Queen Elsa in “Frozen,” a very different kind of heroine.That Elsa remains single in “Frozen” has inspired some widely, wildly divergent readings of that movie, with some commentators claiming her as a L.G.B.T. representation, and others denouncing her for the same reason. It’s entirely possible that “Maleficent,” partly because it’s narratively weak and Ms. Jolie is a powerful screen presence, will inspire its share of warring interpretations (and dismissals). The movie, directed by Robert Stromberg from Linda Woolverton’s script, draws on Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty” and Charles Perrault’s version of the tale. Despite this, the narrative linchpin isn’t Aurora: It’s Maleficent, who doesn’t fit the fairy tale template largely because of her relationships. Stefan angers her, but she so gets over him and soon shifts her attention elsewhere. Mr. Stromberg, a production designer making his feature directing debut, does best when he scales down, as in the lovely shots of Maleficent walking next to a floating, unconscious Aurora, an image that telegraphs more about their relationship than any line of dialogue. The action scenes, by contrast, are visually uninteresting, borderline generic and unnecessary. There are also far too many long shots when the digital renderings (especially those with human figures) pull you out of the story instead of keeping you immersed. But there’s so much to look at in the movie — from the wittily designed creatures to the shocks of bilious green and purple — that the battles quickly fade. (The colors are, as is a galloping race to the rescue, among the many nods to the 1959 “Sleeping Beauty.”)Ms. Jolie is, unsurprisingly, a visual marvel. Her face has been smoothed into an alabaster Cubist mask, and prostheses elongate her already sharp cheekbones; from some angles, it looks as if she had a second set of vestigial wings riding under her skin. The exquisite attention to detail in both the makeup and costume is routine in major productions like this one, of course, but the mixture of Old Hollywood glamour and contemporary fetishwear doesn’t just turn Maleficent into a pleasurable spectacle, it also serves a character who embodies both the past and the future. Ms. Jolie’s performance is similarly bifurcated, with a controlled physicality that, just when it seems to be edging into catwalk blankness, springs to weird life with grotesque facial contortions and spidery movements. Bruno Bettelheim, that great reader of fairy tales, saw “The Sleeping Beauty” as a story of sexual awakening. She wakes only when physically and emotionally mature enough, when she is ready for love and its familiar handmaidens: sex and marriage. It’s at that point, Bettelheim writes in “The Uses of Enchantment,” “the wall of thorns suddenly turns into a wall of big, beautiful flowers, which opens to let the prince enter.” That’s quite the metaphor, but for women, it has sometimes also been a curse, including in movies, where they have traditionally had to wait for a man to get them to their happily ever after. There’s no denying the attractions of that narrative for some of us: Even Lena Dunham got swept off her feet. But, come on! There’s more to life and certainly more to women, which is something that, however imperfectly, “Maleficent” grapples with. I’m still not sure if the movie’s smack-down between patriarchy and matriarchy is the way to go, but at least nobody here is warbling about what she wants before hitting the road to self-actualization.Consciously or not, coherently or not, “Maleficent” tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us. And while that may sound drippy, it’s exactly the kind of hokey that, movie by movie, may finally make a real difference. “Maleficent” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Exactly when she works, however, is a mystery, as she seems to spend most of her time hanging around the rubbish dump, where her patient Rand (a vibrant Sabrina Ouazani) and a group of Palestinian urchins scavenge for valuables. In the evenings, Chloe trudges back to Jerusalem to drink and party with her Israeli neighbor, Ava (Sivan Levy), a conflicted checkpoint guard.Walking an increasingly unstable path between two worlds, Chloe draws closer to Rand’s angry brother, Faysal (Yousef Sweid), her wobbling neutrality mirrored by the film. To help us feel the strain of that position, the writer and director, Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette, lobs a series of tragedies at her stunned heroine.“Both sides is no side,” Faysal lectures Chloe, but his student has so little personality — she’s a wide-eyed, weary cipher — that her moral turmoil is not only weightless but completely invisible.Grim, intelligent and vividly photographed by the director’s father, Philippe Lavalette, “Inch’Allah” works best when the camera alights on Ava and Rand, whose marvelously mobile faces convey all the complexity that Chloe lacks.

But repackaging a Norse god as an alien superhero takes chutzpah, not humor (unless you count the Viking ship that serves as his spacecraft), and movie studios have yet to lose money by assuming that their audiences have the intellectual discernment of newborns. So if the multiple idiocies on view strike you as neither here nor there, it’s probably because your eyeballs are too busy recoiling from the onslaught of disorienting 3-D effects, or else too distracted by the title character’s Popeye arms and really big mallet.Natalie Portman, playing the astrophysicist Jane Foster, certainly is. Ever since meeting her hammer-swinging hero (Chris Hemsworth) two years ago in “Thor,” Jane has been pining to subject the rest of his tool belt to scientific study. (Careful there, Jane; his mythological namesake was closely associated with fertility.) An opportunity arises when she’s invaded by an alien substance known as Aether (like the red weed in “War of the Worlds,” only more floaty) and whisked into a conflict between Thor and the Dark Elves. Newly emerged from hibernation and dead set on sucking every last bit of light from the universe — the screenwriters see no reason to tell us why — the Elves and their leader, Malekith (an unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston) are disappointing villains. Mostly, they just suck up the budget for fancy wigs and fancier contact lenses.Replacing Kenneth Branagh in the director’s chair, Alan Taylor (with six episodes of “Game of Thrones” under his belt) flits awkwardly between a dank, depopulated London and the organ-pipe architecture of Asgard, where Thor’s aging father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), makes pompous pronouncements. Lumbering extras, sporting helmets that give them the look of rutting rams, show up now and then to bash things, but the battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story.Not that we can blame Ms. Portman. Handicapped by technology that makes her head resemble a bowling ball perched on a pipe cleaner, and a character who spends an inordinate amount of time in a dead faint, she may be an unconvincing brainiac, but you’d be hard pressed to find an actor who looks better unconscious. If only Thor himself were more of a wag. But Mr. Hemsworth, voice pitched low enough for mystified worms to detect its vibrations, has neither the glint in his eye nor the lightness in his step that would signal some winking self-awareness. (Whoever wrote this poor man’s lines should be immediately injected with a serious dose of Aether.) What few jokes there are belong to Chris O’Dowd, as Jane’s clueless suitor, and the incomparable Tom Hiddleston, whose value here cannot be overstated. As the debonair flyboy in Terence Davies’s “The Deep Blue Sea,” he gave that scoundrel a heartbreaking fragility, and some of that carries over to complicate his portrayal of Loki, Thor’s scheming brother. Dancing above a leaden plot and lumpy dialogue, Mr. Hiddleston moves his fine-boned features and graceful body, as if what he were doing matters; he seems imported from a quite different movie.Rewarded with the best lines and most flattering camera angles, Loki, the master of illusion, is a genetic anomaly in a bulked-up bloodline. He’s also the spoonful of sugar that helps this medicine go down.“Thor: The Dark World” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Cool weapons, ugly monsters and lopped-off limbs.

SCOTT,"For One Man, Hawaii Is a Land of Problems","In a voice-over at the beginning of “The Descendants,” Matt King (George Clooney) challenges the myth, endemic among mainlanders, that Hawaii, where he lives, is a paradise on earth. His brief rant is buttressed by images of poverty and grime that are powerful but also slightly misleading, since Matt’s story is not — or at least not explicitly — one of deprivation or social inequality.Though he is a bit uncomfortable about admitting it (and though he tries to live a life of low-key, middle-class normalcy), Matt, a real estate lawyer, is as close to an aristocrat as it is possible for an American to be. His family tree stretches back to the earliest white settlers in Hawaii and includes indigenous royalty as well. This bloodline has devolved into a gaggle of pale loafers in loud shirts and sandals — Matt’s cousins — who own a pristine and picturesque tract of land on Kauai. Matt, the trustee of this precious birthright, is in charge of selling it off to developers.This land deal is big news locally, but it is in some ways the least of Matt’s problems, a reminder of the burdens of an identity he both takes for granted and wishes he could shed. His wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), lies in an irreversible coma in a Honolulu hospital after a boating accident. Shortly after Elizabeth’s doctors inform Matt that he is about to become a widower, he learns that she has made him a cuckold.Her impending death and the revelation of her past infidelity send Matt into a tailspin. The double wound also establishes what would seem to be Matt’s unshakable claim on the audience’s sympathy, which Mr. Clooney’s self-effacing charm helps to secure. But Mr. Clooney and the director, Alexander Payne (working from a script Mr. Payne adapted, with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, from Kaui Hart Hemmings’s novel), proceed to shake up our expectations all the same.The way Matt’s predicament plays out is surprising, moving and frequently very funny. Mr. Payne — immeasurably aided by a dazzlingly gifted, doggedly disciplined cast — nimbly sidesteps the sentimental traps that lurk within the film’s premise. He somehow achieves the emotional impact of good melodrama and the hectic absurdity of classic farce without ever seeming to exaggerate. There are times when you laugh or gasp in disbelief at what has just happened — an old man punches a teenager in the face; a young girl utters an outrageous obscenity; Mr. Clooney slips on a pair of boat shoes and runs, like an angry, flightless bird, to a neighbor’s house — and yet every moment of the movie feels utterly and unaffectedly true.Matt, who describes himself as “the back-up parent, the understudy” is suddenly forced to manage his two difficult daughters. The younger one, Scottie (Amara Miller), who is 10, is angry and confused, while her 17-year-old sister, Alex (Shailene Woodley), just seems angry. She has a troubled past, a bad attitude and a grudge against her mother that she refuses to relinquish in spite of Elizabeth’s condition.The emotional trajectory of “The Descendants” is familiar enough. It is about the fracturing and healing that take place within families. Matt needs to bond with his children, make peace with his wife and deal with the pesky politics of entitled cousins. As he works his way through these challenges and others, including a confrontation with his wife’s lover (Matthew Lillard), a lively and complicated mesh of plots and subplots takes shape, but the most striking and satisfying aspects of “The Descendants” are its unhurried pace and loose, wandering structure.In most movies the characters are locked into the machinery of narrative like theme park customers strapped into a roller coaster. Their ups and downs are as predetermined as their shrieks of terror and sighs of relief, and the audience goes along for the ride. But the people in this movie seem to move freely within it, making choices and mistakes and aware, at every turn, that things could be different.Matt in particular is overwhelmed, and sometimes paralyzed, by the necessity of choosing, and the brilliance of Mr. Clooney’s performance lies in his ability to convey indecision, hesitation and the precipitous tumble into error. Matt gets a lot of things right in the end, but along the way he mishandles nearly everything, sometimes because of impulsiveness and sometimes because he is paralyzed, unable to trust or locate his own best instincts.This actor’s instincts, meanwhile, have never been keener or more generous. Mr. Clooney, bolstered by his effortless magnetism, has always been an excellent ensemble player, and while he is at the center of “The Descendants,” he does not dominate the movie. Everyone in it is wonderful: Ms. Woodley (“The Secret Life of the American Teenager”), giving one of the toughest, smartest, most credible adolescent performances in recent memory; Nick Krause as her goofy sidekick, Sid; Robert Forster as Elizabeth’s permanently enraged father; Beau Bridges as Matt’s cousin Hugh.I could go on and on. As the wife of Elizabeth’s lover, Judy Greer, in just a few scenes, slices to the heart of the movie’s marital crisis. But each person who shows up on screen, even for a minute or two with nothing especially important to accomplish, has an odd and memorable individuality. “The Descendants,” streamlining Ms. Hemmings’s ample and engaging book, seems to unfold within a vast landscape of possible stories. What happens to Matt, Scottie and Alex is just a thread in a tapestry of incidents and relationships that has no real end.Mr. Payne, with a light touch and a keen sense of place — this Hawaii is as real and peculiar as the Nebraska of “About Schmidt” or the California wine country of “Sideways” — has made a movie that, for all its modesty, is as big as life. Its heart is occupied by grief, pain and the haunting silence of Elizabeth, whose version of events is the only one we never hear. And yet it is also full of warmth, humor and the kind of grace that can result from our clumsy attempts to make things better.To call “The Descendants” perfect would be a kind of insult, a betrayal of its commitment to, and celebration of, human imperfection. Its flaws are impossible to distinguish from its pleasures. For example: after what feels as if it should be the final scene, a poignant, quiet tableau of emotional resolution and apt visual beauty, Mr. Payne adds another, a prosaic coda to a flight of poetry. Without saying too much or spoiling the mood, I will say that I was grateful for this extra minute, a small gift at the end of a film that understands, in every way, how hard it can be to say goodbye.“The Descendants” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Certain Women’ Are Worlds Unto Themselves,"Though not technically a western, Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women” takes place in a region of broad skies, rocky landscapes and pent-up feelings. Human beings are sparse, and words are even scarcer. But Ms. Reichardt, a transplanted Easterner based in Portland, Ore., is a poet of silences and open spaces, and her plain-looking, taciturn films have their own kind of eloquence, the specific gravity of rare minerals.Working from short stories by Maile Meloy, Ms. Reichardt has composed a splintered group portrait. The three women who, in turn, occupy the center of the screen are loosely connected to one another. They live in the same town, and one of them is having an affair with another’s husband. This adultery is peripheral to the main drama, which is more oblique, and turns on frustrations and failures of communication that are all the more painful for being almost impossible to describe.ImageLaura DernCreditJojo Whilden/IFC FilmsLaura Wells (Laura Dern), a lawyer, contends with a difficult client (Jared Harris), a man whose profound unhappiness with the way things are threatens to erupt into violence. He’s pathetic but also frightening, and Laura tries to keep a safe, professional distance while holding onto her empathy for him, an effort that produces both a note of tension and a deep chord of melancholy.Tension and unacknowledged sorrow also define Gina Lewis (Michelle Williams), who is building a house in the countryside with her husband (James Le Gros) and daughter (Sara Rodier), who she sometimes feels are allied in a silent conspiracy against her. Their family disharmony is underscored — but also, somehow, potentially resolved — when they purchase a pile of old stones from an ancient rancher. Those rocks are at once symbols of transience and of permanence. They lend themselves to solid structures that are nonetheless fated to fall down.In all of Ms. Reichardt’s films — from “River of Grass” and “Old Joy,” through “Wendy and Lucy,” “Meek’s Cutoff” and “Night Movies” — the human presence feels fragile and contingent. And the stories of Laura and Gina, while interesting, deftly told and meticulously acted, also feel a little thin, more like anecdotes plucked from the stream of everyday life than like episodes of illumination. The third panel of this triptych is something else, though: a quiet, perfect vignette through which silent passion surges like an underground stream.ImageMichelle WilliamsCreditJojo Whilden/IFC FilmsIn it, Kristen Stewart plays Beth Travis, a young lawyer teaching a night class at a rural school. Ostensibly on the topic of education law, something Beth admits she doesn’t know much about, the course is mainly an after-hours opportunity for teachers to complain about their jobs. Also in the room, for unclear reasons, is a young ranch hand named Jamie (Lily Gladstone), who finds herself smitten with the instructor, and who pursues her infatuation with nervous dedication.This love story — as full of longing as a great pop song, but without any overt statement of passion — is embedded in the hard routines of Western life: long drives, repetitive chores, endless cups of coffee. Ms. Stewart manages the remarkable feat of being at once convincingly mousy and unmistakably glamorous. With her stringy hair, stooped shoulders and anxious smile, Beth is a weary, self-effacing drone, except to Jamie, for whom she is a radiant queen. And Ms. Stewart, a tremendously disciplined actress, holds onto just enough of the magnetism that made her a movie star to allow us to see the character both ways, and to understand the ferocity of Jamie’s attraction to her.That crush is the movie’s strongest source of heat, and it has the effect of rendering the other parts of “Certain Women” a little chillier and smaller than they might otherwise have seemed. The subtlety of the film is both an accomplishment and a limitation. It’s hard not to want more for these women, and to wish you could see more of them.“Certain Women” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, smoking and sadness.

But given censorship  — relaxed since the 1990s, but still there  — and a national reluctance to confront the ethnic scapegoating that occasionally results in the murders of large numbers of Indonesian Chinese, it’s a sign of changing times that the film could be made at all.The movie is a series of vignettes, practically blackouts, that jump back and forth in time and among a loosely connected group of characters centered on Linda, a young ethnic Chinese woman (Ladya Cheryl). All of them want to be someone or somewhere else. Linda’s childhood friend Cahyono (Carlo Genta), beaten up as a child for being a “Chinese brat,” wishes he were Japanese. Her father, a blind dentist  — the suggestion is that he blinded himself with a scalpel while trying to change his appearance  — wants to convert to Islam so that he can take a second, younger wife and possibly have a son.Linda, spunky and resentful, tells her grandfather that she is going to stop calling him engkong, an Indonesian word for grandfather, and start using the Dutch word opa. In the background televisions carry 10th-anniversary commemorations of the 1998 Jakarta riots in which hundreds of ethnic Chinese were killed.Boldest is a plot involving a wealthy, gay Indonesian  — he’s involved with an  “American Idol”-style show  — frustrated by his partner’s reluctance to engage in a particular sex act. He makes a deal with the dentist, whose mistress wants to sing on television. The resulting man-on-man-on-reluctant-man sex scene is discreetly filmed but more matter of fact  — and funnier  — than anything in Hollywood’s recent spate of bromances.“Blind Pig,” which won the Fipresci international critics’ prize at the Rotterdam film festival this year, has the spacey vibe of the work of the Thai director Pen-ek Ratanaruang, another Southeast Asian who has emerged on the Western festival circuit. Edwin’s concern with coherent narrative is glancing at best.The movie develops, as far as it does, through repeated visual motifs, jokes and symbols: the firecrackers (a Chinese invention) that Linda sets off to fend off both evil spirits and racist Indonesians; the dumplings the dentist’s wife patiently assembles, which appear to be filled with pork; the Stevie Wonder song “I Just Called to Say I Love You,” which characters sing throughout the film.And there is a pig, presumably blind and tethered in an empty field, which the camera lingers on several times. When last seen it has broken free and is trotting toward an indeterminate future. Freedom or dumpling filling? We’re left to wonder.BLIND PIG WHO WANTS TO FLYOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Edwin; director of photography, Sidi Saleh; edited by Herman Kumala Panca; art directors, Iqbal Raya and Eros Eflin; produced by Meiske Taurisia, Mr. Saleh and Edwin; released by BabibutaFilm.

That movie followed the misfortunes of Samantha (Najarra Townsend), who, after being drugged and sexually assaulted, found herself with an acute case of cloudy eyes, lesions, a putrefying complexion and a hunger for human flesh. Now Samantha appears to be history (“dead” would be a misnomer), and Riley (Matt Mercer), who attempted to seduce her in the first movie, has come down with her symptoms.But before he succumbs entirely to a nonlife of zombiedom, he is determined to track down BJ (Morgan Peter Brown), the man responsible for Samantha’s infection. In tow is his grandmother’s caregiver, Harper (Anna Lore), who’s not looking so healthy herself after giving Riley a kiss over drinks. (For that matter, neither is Riley’s granny.) Also on BJ’s trail is a police detective (the Scottish actress Marianna Palka, intermittently stifling her accent).The first “Contracted” benefited immensely from Ms. Townsend’s performance and expert, if nausea-inducing, makeup, as well as Mike Testin’s cinematography. Mr. Testin is back for the sequel, directed with brisk efficiency by Josh Forbes (a recent MTV Video Music Award nominee), as are the impressive visual effects. Mr. Mercer’s character doesn’t attract sympathy comparable to that for Ms. Townsend’s (Ms. Lore’s Harper fares better), but there is no holding back on the worms, dermatologic nightmares, venereal-disease metaphors and hints of future sequels.

O. SCOTT,"Howls of a Life, Buried Deep Within","Claireece Jones, the Harlem teenager at the center of “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” lives in a world of specific and overwhelming horror. She goes by her middle name, Precious, which seems like a cruel taunt, since nearly everyone around her thinks she’s worthless and lets her know it.Precious’s mother, Mary, played with operatic fervor by the comedian Mo’Nique, dispenses a daily ration of humiliation and abuse. The constant verbal and physical violence she directs at her daughter would be shocking even without the monstrous crime that hangs over their dim, dirty apartment like a cloud. Precious, overweight and illiterate — and played by an extraordinarily poised first-time actress named Gabourey Sidibe  — has a young daughter and is pregnant for a second time. The father in both cases, who is nowhere to be seen, is Precious’s father too.This information is bluntly presented at the beginning of Sapphire’s 1996 novel, a first-person narrative composed in rough, stylized dialect. In Lee Daniels’s risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Precious’s life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as “Push” achieves an eloquence that makes it far more than a fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does “Precious” avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings.Mr. Daniels, directing his second feature (after the vivid and eccentric “Shadowboxer”), is not afraid to mix styles and genres. In his determination to do justice to Claireece’s inner life, as well as to her circumstances, he allows splashes of fantasy, daubs of humor and floods of unabashed melodrama into the drab landscape of her struggle. Ugliness is all around her, but beauty is there too.There is something almost reckless about this filmmaker’s eclecticism, which extends from the casting — pop stars and television personalities alongside trained and untrained actors — to the visual textures and the soundtrack music. “Precious” is a hybrid, a mash-up that might have been ungainly, but that manages to be graceful instead. It’s partly a bootstrap drama of resilience and redemption, complete with a hardworking teacher (Paula Patton) wrangling a classroom full of disadvantaged girls. It’s also the nearly Gothic story of a child tormented by the cruelty of adults, as lurid as a Victorian potboiler or a modern-day tell-all memoir.Above all “Precious” is unabashedly populist in its potent emotional appeal — not for nothing did Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey sign on as executive producers around the time of the film’s debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January — and at the same time determined to challenge its audience’s complacency as only a genuine work of art can.Mary, brimming with rage, thwarted love and plain meanness, is a character bound to provoke discomfort. Even otherwise misogynistic hip-hop artists will pay tribute to the heroism of African-American mothers, and to see that piety so thoroughly dispensed with is downright shocking.Other provocations are more subtle but no less pointed. There are virtually no men in this movie. Precious’s father is glimpsed briefly in flashbacks of his assaults on her, and in the fantasy sequences that provide escape from her pain Precious hobnobs with handsome boys, but otherwise the only male character of significance is a hospital worker played by Lenny Kravitz. Otherwise, Precious’s cosmos, for better and for worse, is a universe of women: the social worker (Mariah Carey, scrubbed of any vestige of divahood); the teacher, Ms. Rain; her co-worker in the remedial education program, played by the comedian and talk show host Sherri Shepherd; and Precious’s fellow students.These characters all can be seen as surrogate mothers, aunts and sisters, who together provide Precious with a more functional family (to say the least) than what she has at home. But their love is also enabled by institutions and government policies. An unstated but self-evident moral of “Precious,” set during Ronald Reagan’s presidency and based on a book published in the year of Bill Clinton’s welfare reform, is that government can provide not only a safety net, but also, in small and consequential ways, a lifeline.I will leave it for others to parse the truth or the timeliness of this message. But “Precious” is, in any case, less the examination of a social problem than the illumination of an individual’s painful and partial self-realization. Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. “These people talked like TV stations I didn’t even watch,” she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance.And Ms. Sidibe, perhaps the least-known member of this movie’s unusual cast, is also the glue that holds it together. Nimble and self-assured as Mr. Daniels’s direction may be, he could not make you believe in “Precious” unless you were able to believe in Precious herself. You will.“Precious” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has frank depictions of emotional and physical violence, including the sexual abuse of a child.PRECIOUSBased on the Novel ‘Push’ by SapphireOpens on Friday in New York,  Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta.Directed by Lee Daniels; written by Geoffrey Fletcher, based on the novel “Push” by Sapphire; director of photography, Andrew Dunn; edited by Joe Klotz; music by Mario Grigorov; production designer, Roshelle Berliner; produced by Mr. Daniels, Sarah Siegel-Magness and Gary Magness; released by Lionsgate.

They’ve just performed their last song on a set that looks so artificial that you half-expect the Sharks and the Jets to leap into the frame. Instead, that Jersey music man Frankie Valli and the other Seasons, along with a crowd of central-casting types, gather one last time and together warble and fancy-foot down a back-lot street. They finish big and then they all stop, staring straight ahead as sweat pops and bodies tremble under the now harsh lighting. That’s entertainment, baby, and it is hard work. “Jersey Boys” is a strange movie, and it’s a Clint Eastwood enterprise, both reasons to see it. For those with a love of doo-wop, it also provides a toe-tapping, ear-worming stroll down rock ’n’ roll memory lane that dovetails with that deeply cherished American song and dance about personal triumph over adversity through hard work, tough times and self-sacrifice. It’s a redemption narrative that’s got a good beat, and you can dance to it. No wonder it’s been such a popular trip: The stage version of “Jersey Boys” opened in 2005 on Broadway, where it’s still going strong, and has long been printing money around the world, from Australia to South Africa. Like the original musical, the movie was written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice and has a clever, inviting narrative gimmick: all four of the Seasons take turns telling the group’s tale. This has led to the musical’s being sloppily likened to “Rashomon,” a comparison that works only if you’ve never seen that 1950 Akira Kurosawa touchstone. In “Rashomon,” four characters recount a traumatic episode in a forest — a woman is raped and her husband murdered — in separate, contradictory flashbacks. Together, the four versions don’t add up to one unified, coherently climaxing story: The mystery remains unsolved and the reminiscences remain contingent, which makes the film as much about storytelling as a crime.The stakes and tension are lower in “Jersey Boys,” which is narrated largely in chronological order by the group’s four members, sometimes while they’re talking right into the camera. Unlike “Rashomon,” these memoirists don’t necessarily return to the same scenes. Instead, their story opens with some text that sets the place and time (New Jersey, the 1950s) before settling on Tommy DeVito (a charismatic Vincent Piazza), who’s speed-talking while sauntering down a street. With the camera tagging along, he guides the story into a barbershop, where a young Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young), is nervously training, as a local gangster, Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken), holds court in a chair, telegraphing the Mob’s role in this story.The old-timey milieu of the barbershop, a favorite staging ground for films about the Mafia (including “The Godfather”), is an early indication of Mr. Eastwood’s self-consciously artificial approach. This is cemented in other early scenes, starting with Frankie and his parents slurping spaghetti while throwing around snatches of Italian, all in view of an ornamental wall clock that’s bracketed by images of the pope and Frank Sinatra. Minutes later, Frankie is out the door, waiting on a dark street and playing lookout for Tommy, who’s around the corner trying to steal a safe. A beat cop emerges from the shadows with a smile and asks Frankie why he’s out. Frankie says he’s wooing a girl and starts singing as if to prove it. The whole thing looks and sounds so canned — from the conspicuousness of a set that’s been vacuumed of the dirt of real life to the goofily contrived setup — it’s a surprise that the Bowery Boys don’t swing by, too. (Every scene seems to point to another film allusion.) If the family-dinner caricatures register as mildly amusing, the bit with the cop is played even more broadly. The events that immediately follow, showing Tommy, Frankie and a third pal trying to pinch the safe, actually crosses into full-bore slapstick. This escalation from small laughs to big ones helps establish an inaugural breeziness and serves as a reminder that, as a filmmaker and a performer, Mr. Eastwood has long put myth into play with realism. That tension reverberates throughout “Jersey Boys” as a mythopoeic tale emerges from thick accents (dis, dat and da odder), false starts, personnel shifts and name changes. A genius, Bob Gaudio (a very good Erich Bergen), enters the group courtesy of a mutual friend: Joey a.k.a. the future Joe Pesci (an amusing Joseph Russo who’s got Mr. Pesci’s “O.K., O.K.” down). Frankie rechristens himself Valley only to Italianize it as Valli, and then he and the other guys, including Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), land on the name the Four Seasons. They meet a producer, Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle, very good), and together find their groove. And, in 1962, they begin mining gold, starting with “Sherry” and “Big Girls Don’t Cry.”The songs and some of the actors pull you into the story even as other performers and some of Mr. Eastwood’s choices wrench you out. Mr. Young originated the role of Frankie on Broadway, and he persuasively approximates Mr. Valli’s patented strangled falsetto if not its weird beauty. Mr. Young certainly catches your ear and attention when he’s scaling those heights, but once the music fades, so does he. That’s partly because the Frankie of “Jersey Boys” turns out to be really dull: nice, square and uncomplicated to a fault. That might not matter if Mr. Young were a more expressive screen presence, yet he’s oddly inert, especially around his eyes, which here — partly because of Mr. Eastwood’s fondness for working with a dark, almost monochromatic palette — remain frustratingly opaque. It’s disappointing that Mr. Eastwood, a director who can convey extraordinary depths of feeling in his work, didn’t do more with this material. Frankie’s scenes with his family tend to be embarrassingly bad, including a blowout with his wife, Mary (Renée Marino), that devolves into a wincing battle between the selfish male artist and the volubly unhappy woman at home. It’s enough to make you wish that movies like these didn’t bother with the little women in the lives of these big men. Worse yet are the scenes with Frankie and his troubled daughter, Francine (played by different performers), whose role here is, appallingly, to do little more than pump her father’s tears. The family stuff seriously undermines the musical’s claims on the truth. “Jersey Boys” at first seems like a curious choice for Mr. Eastwood, particularly given the heft of many of his films. And it may be that he just liked the show. It’s hard not to think that there’s something personal here, too, as suggested by the clip from “Rawhide” — the 1950s television show that broke Mr. Eastwood — that plays before a character loses his virginity. This moment could be read as a Hitchcockian cameo or as a slyly suggestive joke about what turns boys into men. Yet, like the movie’s four finally harmonious narrators and its showstopping finale, the cameo is also a reminder that this isn’t just about a group, its struggles and comeback. It’s also about an American myth of success and all the singing, the smiling and the dissembling that goes into its making. “Jersey Boys” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

GOLD,Higher Calling? It’s the Family Business,"Films like Martin Scorsese’s “Kundun” and Bernardo Bertolucci’s “Little Buddha” acquainted American audiences with the Tibetan Buddhist belief that the souls of great lamas are reincarnated in newborns, who must be identified and then schooled to fulfill their destinies as spiritual teachers. But what happens if a designated youngster rejects that call?Jennifer Fox’s remarkable documentary “My Reincarnation” follows one such individual over the course of 20 years, only to find that destiny will have its way. In the late 1980s Ms. Fox (“An American Love Story”) served as the secretary of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, a master of the Dzogchen tradition of Buddhism who has lived in Italy for a half-century and built a teaching and spiritual center there, and was permitted to film it. His Westernized son, Yeshi, has been acknowledged since he was 5 to be the reincarnation of his father’s uncle Khyentse, a great Dzogchen master himself. Yeshi, though, in his late teens, strongly rebuffs a life expected by others, including his father, to whom he does not feel especially close.Ms. Fox returned 13 years later, filming off and on until about 2009. Yeshi — now in his 30s with a family of his own and a career in information-technology management — has, through dreams and visions, a slow but insistent spiritual awakening. When he finally travels to Tibet, he is met by hundreds of Khyentse’s followers, some of whom have hungered for his arrival for decades.These are among the film’s most successful scenes; others include those outlining the casual, ordinary home life of a Tibetan master. Still, an awful lot is packed into a bit more than 80 minutes — Yeshi’s journey, his father’s history, the growth of the Dzogchen movement, samples of Buddhist teachings — and the parts don’t always cohere. So the father-and-son story wins out.Especially in the early footage, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is an engaging, charismatic figure; by the end, Yeshi is finding his own footing, able to relate to a young, wired-in audience. “My Reincarnation” makes a pretty strong case: when the family business is enlightenment, listen to your dad.",0,92674.0,,0

Idealized types — which, because this is a Hollywood movie, means a lot of balloon breasts and itty-bitty noses — these avatars or “surries” allow their meat-puppeteers not just to act but also to feel by remote, a state of alienated affairs that has lowered the crime rate while also forcing lumpy, spotty, all-too-human naysayers onto machine-free reservations.So how does Bruce Willis fit into all this? Not comfortably. But then, if you were a bald action star forced into a dandified blond wig and an f/x face-lift, as he is to play his character’s surrogate, you would sneak looks for the exit too. Although he ditches his creepy counterpart fairly early, Mr. Willis has little to do but hit his predictable marks and mouth the generic dialogue. In this kind of industrial entertainment, particularly one that seems to be missing some connective narrative tissue, it’s hard to know if the writers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris (working from the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele), or the director, Jonathan Mostow, can be credited or blamed for what’s left on screen.“Surrogates” is rated PG-13.

(The title is disingenuous; other documentaries have also examined these questions.) The rise of big agriculture, we’re told, has led to an alarming reduction in the varieties of food being grown and has imprisoned farmers in debt as they have become beholden to the corporations that sell seeds and pesticides. Along with this sea change in the way our food is produced has come the rise of genetically modified crops, something that to many people is yet another case of humans’ manipulating nature with no idea of potential long-term consequences.These issues are for the most part voiced by small farmers, counterculture types and others who are earnest but don’t bring much gravitas or scientific evidence to the case. The film would be better if it had fewer shots of quixotic explorers sampling jungle plants while airy music plays and more hard information.

The decision is believed to have killed the disease along with the Scottish population, but when it surfaces in London, officials reveal that a hardy band of Glasgow inhabitants survived the epidemic and might hold clues to a cure.Enter the stoic, one-eyed mercenary Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra, of the television show “Nip/Tuck”), who is ostensibly entrusted with leading a team of soldiers into Glasgow on a mission to find a doctor-turned-political leader named Kane (Malcolm McDowell) and learn how the Glasgow contingent survived. Really, though, Eden is mainly on hand to impersonate another sci-fi hero, Snake Plissken from John Carpenter’s “Escape From New York,” and to punch, kick, run and shoot her way through situations shamelessly cribbed from Mr. Carpenter’s film, George Miller’s “Mad Max” trilogy, “Aliens” and other dystopian touchstones.“Doomsday” has an appealing punk-rock sneer, but aside from a few clever music cues — including a Fine Young Cannibals song that accompanies a deranged bacchanal given by fine young cannibals — swagger is, unfortunately, its only notable quality.The film’s bellowing, Mohawk-topped villain, Sol (Craig Conway), is a personality-free retread of Vernon Wells’s memorable Wez from “The Road Warrior.” Major supporting characters — including a squad leader, played by Adrian Lester, and a gruff yet caring boss, portrayed by Bob Hoskins — are so lifeless they could have been cast with inflatable dolls. The final chase, modeled on an epic set-piece from Mr. Miller’s second “Mad Max” movie, is likewise a bust, substituting gore, shaky camerawork and chop-chop editing for Mr. Miller’s symphonic build-up and release.Mr. Marshall gained a cult following with his 2002 debut feature, “Dog Soldiers,” about British troops menaced by werewolves in the Scottish highlands, and acquired serious (and well-deserved) critical respect for his 2005 film, “The Descent,” about a group of female spelunkers who encounter terrifying creatures while exploring a network of caves.In terms of story, “The Descent” and “Doomsday” are as different as two genre films can be, but the falloff in artistic quality is still quantifiable. Where “The Descent” was a slow, quiet, exquisitely modulated, startlingly original film, “Doomsday” is frenetic, loud, wildly imprecise and so derivative that it doesn’t so much seem to reference its antecedents as try on their famous images like a child playing dress-up. Homage without innovation isn’t homage, it’s karaoke.“Doomsday” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

But he won’t be throwing any telephones.Mr. Weinstein’s celebrated temper is addressed during “Unauthorized.” So is the founding ethos of the Weinstein brothers (Harvey and the more retiring Bob) to take a hard-sell approach to what was previously an afterthought of American movies: Their early success, like “The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,” “Cinema Paradiso” and, most notably, “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” proved there was big money in low-budget (and foreign) movies. The company’s subsequent purchase by Disney gave the brothers the financial clout to virtually corner the indie market. Their tactics were often ruthless; their enemies, presumably, legion.But most of this is dusty old news, and few of those enemies show up anyway in Mr. Avrich’s film, which compensates for a lack of revelation with portentous music and a rather ham-fisted narration by the actor Albert Schultz. When Mr. Schultz says Mr. Weinstein’s boyhood home was “a six-story, rent-controlled housing development in Flushing, Queens,” it’s as if he’s announcing that the subject had been raised by wolves. Mr. Weinstein’s departure from Disney is backed by the Puccini aria “Nessun Dorma,” which is simply musical overkill.Martin Scorsese compares Mr. Weinstein to Cecil B. DeMille; Peter Bart of Variety calls him “ a maverick.” The harshest testimony is delivered by the director George Hickenlooper, who died last year; his experience making “Factory Girl” for Mr. Weinstein sounds like a nightmare. The author Peter Biskind, a recurring presence in “Unauthorized,” was responsible for “Down and Dirty Pictures” in 2004, a far more sensational study of Mr. Weinstein’s behavior. Very little of that surfaces here.Ultimately, “Unauthorized” never recovers from its fallacious opening statement: How do you make a film like this, Mr. Schultz asks, when few subjects “are more determined to control their own image and the final cut than Harvey Weinstein?” If Mr. Weinstein plied his professional craft the same way he has controlled his image, his protégé Quentin Tarantino would still be working in a video store.",0,,,0

Stiff, vague bits of exposition establish that the youths had, indeed, been in some kind of maze. Now they are in a large industrial compound, saved from a nefarious organization called WCKD by another mysterious crew led by Janson (Aidan Gillen), a transparently shady guy himself. The teenagers are among the only people left immune to a virus that turns humans into zombielike mutants that shriek like velociraptors.Thomas discovers that Janson is stringing kids up, unconscious and riddled with tubes, for some reason related to the virus. That’s enough info for him to grab his friends and skedaddle. Their unlikely jailbreak sends them blinking into a blasted landscape of ruined skyscrapers and giant sand dunes, like some combination of Tatooine and Detroit, where they hope to survive long enough to find a fabled group of resistance fighters.“The Scorch Trials” adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre, but it’s at least less ponderous than its predecessor. The many chases and ludicrous narrow escapes offer respectable doses of adrenaline.“What do we do now?” a weary character asks near the end. With one last rousing speech from Thomas, that’s obvious: Make a third movie, due in 2017.“Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

GOLD,Review: ‘Wildlike’ Pits a Teenage Girl Against the Alaskan Wilderness,"In “Wildlike,” Mackenzie (Ella Purnell), a 14-year-old from Seattle whose father has died and whose mother is in rehab, is sent to live with her uncle in Alaska for the summer. But when the creep starts molesting her, she runs away, alone and desperate in strange if beautiful country. Scrambling to stay ahead of her uncle, Mackenzie eventually attaches to Bartlett (Bruce Greenwood), a middle-aged backpacker headed to Denali National Park, in the unspoken hope that he’ll help her get home.Written and directed by Frank Hall Green, this drama makes an odd-couple match not just of its main characters, but of film types. “Wildlike” pairs a small, nuanced story of sexual abuse and its fallout with a travelogue of spectacular vistas, as if immersion in the great outdoors could itself hasten recovery from trauma.Maybe it can. Mr. Greenwood (“Flight,” “Meek’s Cutoff”) is solid, every close-up revealing Bartlett’s confusion, frustration and eventual realization about what to do with this girl he cannot shake. As a teenage cipher, Ms. Purnell is less successful; her constant fingernail biting is supposed to convey anxiety, while she remains mostly in a sullen pout. (As Mackenzie becomes more trusting, she sheds the raccoon-eyed goth look.) Ann Dowd makes a brief but reassuring presence as a vacationer who hosts the two at her campsite.A final act — with Bartlett, Mackenzie and her uncle (Brian Geraghty) all on the same ferry to Juneau — is a misstep, unnecessarily juicing a previously low-key study. The “Wildlike” landscapes are exhilarating, but when the film works, it’s because of the interiors.",0,,,0

SCOTT,Revenge Is a Dish Best Served by a Robot,"“Law Abiding Citizen,” a blunt and sadistic revenge thriller starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler, occasionally pauses from the mayhem to stage a solemn debate about law, justice and morality. Mr. Butler, playing a family man whose wife and daughter were murdered by thugs, feels he was let down by the system, which gave one of the thugs a light sentence in exchange for testimony against the other thug, who was sentenced to death. Mr. Foxx, the prosecutor who made that deal, thinks that the system, however imperfect, did its job.But really, “Law Abiding Citizen” has about as much to say about real-life legal issues as “Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen” had to say about defense policy. And it has less ethical gravity than any three of the “Saw” movies. Though it sometimes puts on a serious face, this movie, directed with snarling, snappish style by F. Gary Gray (“The Italian Job”), wears its preposterousness with a certain pride. It’s about the cat-and-mouse game between two very smart guys, and it’s perfectly happy to be as dumb as it wants.Nick Rice, Mr. Foxx’s character, is slick and ambitious, proud of his 96 percent conviction rate and quite sure that he’s the cleverest and coolest person in the room. This does not seem like much of a stretch for Mr. Foxx, who is cashing in on his Oscar rather than going after a second one. Mr. Butler, for his part, displays a surliness that many in Hollywood seem to mistake for charisma, and suffers the anguish of violent bereavement as if it were an annoying gastrointestinal ailment.His character, Clyde Shelton, returns 10 years after the death of his family to tie up some loose ends. He dispatches the thugs, willingly goes to prison and starts doing dinner theater Hannibal Lecter for Mr. Foxx’s benefit. “Some lessons must be learned in blood,” Clyde declares, one of many portentous proverbs that he seems to have learned during his career as a military killing-gizmo specialist.The details of his job history are revealed, during a secret meeting in a tunnel somewhere, late in the movie. But don’t think I’ve spoiled anything. By the time I saw “Law Abiding Citizen,” I had already seen the trailer four or five times. Another 40 viewings would have added up to the running time of the whole film, without much loss of pleasure or nuance.Well, that’s not entirely true. Most of the fun in the feature-length “Law Abiding Citizen” comes not from the cleverly rigged explosions and bloodlettings — including one unleashed by a robot in a cemetery — but rather from the game and gifted supporting cast, who are not featured in the two-minute trailer version.Colm Meaney, Leslie Bibb and Bruce McGill are all much better than they need to be, as is Viola Davis in a few scenes as the mayor of Philadelphia, where this bloodbath takes place. You can’t help regretting that some of their characters will meet fiery or bloody ends. On the other hand,  the actors were no doubt paid well for their suffering.“Law Abiding Citizen” is rated R. It has a lot of grisly and sometimes imaginative violence and some swearing too.LAW ABIDING CITIZENOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by F.

Coiled yet cool, Billy has the liquid physical grace and bright eyes of a predator. He was built to win. Even his name, with its short syllabic bursts, sounds ready for ESPN exultations. That he’s played by Brad Pitt giving the quintessential Brad Pitt performance just seals the deal. It didn’t turn out that way, and in 2001 this high school star turned major-league washout was no longer a player but the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, the little team that could but didn’t.Well, sometimes it did. In 2001 the A’s actually finished second in the American League West, but that October, in the game that opens the movie, they lost the Division Series to the New York Yankees. The score was 5-3, but as numbers that flash across the screen suggest — $114,457,768 vs. $39,722,689 — that loss, in the final game of a five-game series, was nowhere near a humiliation. Based on Michael Lewis’s nimble, joyously entertaining nonfiction chronicle of the Athletics’ sprint toward the top despite the odds and dollar signs, “Moneyball” is an exuberant fictionalized look at how Mr. Beane helped transform the team, one of the poorest in baseball, into serious competition for the wealthiest franchises, mostly by ignoring everything he’d been taught about the game.The old baseball knowledge, as more than a few earlier movies have taught, was built on rich whiffs of romance and new sod, and highly subjective ideas about what it takes to win, including looking right for the part, having a certain stance on the mound, even a good face. Early in “Moneyball” there’s a funny scene of Billy (who of course has a great face), sitting around with his council of elders: the old-timers, mostly, who scour the country for the next big hope. The old men are jawing about the pluses and minuses of draft prospects, ticking off assets and defects but also body parts. At times they sound as if they’re looking for Saturday night dates, not athletes.Billy knows there’s something wrong about this received wisdom (one scout insists that an ugly girlfriend means that a player doesn’t have confidence), but he doesn’t have the tools to fix the problem. He gets them when he meets Peter Brand (a just-right Jonah Hill), a computer whiz with an economics degree from Yale and a big man’s waddle. (The character is based on Mr. Beane’s slim former assistant, the Harvard-educated Paul DePodesta, now the vice president for player development and amateur scouting for the New York Mets.) With his glasses and middle-management jackets, Peter looks like he should be crunching numbers at an accounting firm. But there’s a baseball clutched in his hand and a love of the game tucked deep in his being right alongside a radical way of understanding baseball statistics.Directed by Bennett Miller, from a sharp, sleek script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (and a story by Stan Chervin) that smartly borrows lines from Mr. Lewis’s book as well as its giddy irreverence, “Moneyball” is a story about how Billy, with Peter’s help and his laptop crammed with numbers, trades old knowledge for new. It’s a story of baseball and bean counters, the hunt and the kill, yet while there are on-field scenes, the movie is less about the game as a pastime or passion or even a cruel capitalist sport than as a great epistemological problem. What is the question? Billy asks his bewildered scouts right before hiring Peter, a guy with a poster of Plato hanging above his bed.Like “The Social Network,” which is about the creation of Facebook and yet so much more (it was also written by Mr. Sorkin) “Moneyball” is about a fundamental cultural shift and the rise of the information elite. Instead of going by instinct, Peter knows what he knows because he’s a disciple of Bill James, a once-marginal figure who, starting in 1977, began publishing an abstract that offered a new, rationalized way of looking at the game. In a nutshell, Mr. James looked at baseball statistics in a different light, less by breaking the numbers down in another way but by seeing that what appeared to be objective facts, like fielding statistics, were, as he wrote, “a record of opinions.” And these numbers didn’t just describe baseball; they gave the game its language, its “fiction and drama and poetry.”Like a linguist Mr. James studied that language, looked at its form, context, meaning, and called his new approach sabermetrics. Among other things he could see value in underappreciated, often underpaid and ignored players whom conventional thinkers saw as destined for the minors. In the movie Peter preaches this new gospel to Billy, who embraces it with born-again fervor, partly because it clarifies the mystery of why he never became the player he was drafted to be: he had the tools, as the scouts like to say, but they just didn’t work in the majors. (In reality it was a former general manager of the A’s, Sandy Alderson, now with the Mets, who introduced Mr. Beane to Mr. James’s work.)Mr. Miller, largely shaking off the official art-house pretensions of his breakout feature, “Capote,” takes all this seemingly dry, dusty, inside-baseball stuff and turns it into the kind of all-too-rare pleasurable Hollywood diversion that gives you a contact high. He still has his serious, or rather too-serious, side: he bookends the story with ophthalmologically close shots of Billy’s eyes shining in the dark, as if soliciting you to peep into the windows of a soul that, as much as any man’s or woman’s can be revealed, emerges through the script and Mr. Pitt’s fully inhabited, appealingly barbed performance. There are some overhead shots of the A’s emerald field too, including one of a large American flag being unfurled, that feel like the efforts of a director needlessly looking for big symbolic moments, perhaps particularly post-Sept. 11.He needn’t have bothered. The movie and its meaning are already there, in the details (the ugly rooms, the uglier clothing), the performances and especially in the emphasis on process and how teams and players are built and broken, saved and discarded. What works in “Moneyball” is showing not telling: the scenes of men doing and being and sometimes failing, as in the interwoven flashbacks to the young Billy, played by Reed Thompson. There’s an unnecessary Sorkin-sounding lecture toward the finish that explains what you already know; for the most part, though, the screenplay obscures huge chunks of exposition through the radio chatter of announcers and listeners. And it gives Mr. Pitt, who hurtles through the movie, a chance to scat like a juiced-up Ella Fitzgerald, working his phones and seemingly every other general manager in the country, as he transforms a new baseball philosophy into action.It’s hard to imagine anyone but Mr. Pitt in the role. He’s relaxed yet edgy and sometimes unsettling, as in his testy exchanges, bristling with tamped-down fury, with the A’s manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman, wearing a head of peach fuzz and a scowl). Though Mr. Miller holds onto the romance of baseball that Mr. James and others helped strip away (this is, after all, a tale of winners and losers), Billy doesn’t really change: he just becomes his perfect self. When he first goes after Peter, he moves in like a shark. Initially Peter can’t look Billy in the face, and when they talk, Peter keeps dropping his eyes, like the plain girl who can’t believe the hottest guy at school is even talking to her. But he is.“Moneyball” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Dhoni: The Untold Story’ Recalls a Cricketer’s Ascent,"You don’t have to understand cricket to enjoy a good cricket movie. “Lagaan” (2001), whose centerpiece was a rousing match of underdog (Indian) versus overdog (British colonials), got the heart pounding, even if you couldn’t follow all the ins and outs of the game. It was the rare Bollywood movie to reach across the aisle, as it were, attracting moviegoers beyond the faithful.To warm to the biopic “M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story,” you probably do have to be a cricket fan, and an indulgent one at that. Long (180 minutes) and languid, it takes you through the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the unflappable captain of the Indian cricket team that won the 2011 World Cup.Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput), as presented here, is a natural athlete — cricket wasn’t even his sport of choice as a boy — a nice guy and, in the end, something like a national hero. He meets setbacks with a pause (a kind of timeout) and a hard-to-read smile. Then he goes on. What makes him tick? That remains the untold story.The movie, written and directed by Neeraj Pandey, is not hagiographic or overly obvious. Instead, it’s something of a quiet muddle, with too many squandered or dramatically blurry scenes. (Even the song montages are wasted; in one we see three versions of the same action, as if the editor ran out of ideas or footage.)Mr. Pandey gets a bit of help from his star: Mr. Rajput lends Dhoni a poker-faced charisma and manages to convey some vague determination. But vague determination does not a hero make. I learned more about Mr. Dhoni — his enigmatic character and what marked him as a great captain — by reading about him after watching this movie than I did during three long hours.“M.S.

The delay probably explains why the film takes nearly 40 minutes to deliver a glorified walk-on from Melissa McCarthy, who wasn’t nearly as major a star when it was made, or why she and the other well-known actors look about a decade younger.Like the can that got lost in the pantry and is now showing telltales of botulism risk, this misbegotten mockumentary, directed by Guy Shalem and Cathryn Michon (though only Mr. Shalem was credited in 2007), hasn’t been improved by time. The movie tries to do for amateur cooking contests what “Best in Show” did for dog competitions, but the strained folksiness and tired stereotypes couldn’t be further from the snap and wit of prime Christopher Guest.The contestants include Sharon (Ms. Michon) and Pauline (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a pair of sisters from Minnesota. Sharon is engaged to a closeted African-American Lutheran (Gary Anthony Williams) whose mere existence the movie seems to regard as humorous.In a film with no shortage of wacky food names (“that-time-of-the-month crab puffs”) or kitchen disasters, Pauline’s creamed corn for the lactose intolerant is the only recipe that sounds remotely edible. What Ms. McCarthy does with sweet potatoes and way too many marshmallows is more likely to elicit a retch than a laugh — and suggests a culinary correlative to the way “Cook Off!” has been slapped together.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,"A Tale of Jacob, Esau and Muscles","At one point in “Warrior” we see Brendan Conlon, a high school science teacher, laying down the law — the law of physics that is — for his students. “Force equals mass times acceleration,” he writes on the board. That formula might be of use in thinking this new film from Gavin O’Connor, which grasps the Newtonian principles at the heart of pugilistic melodrama.“Warrior” takes place in the world of mixed martial arts, and it is appropriately blunt, powerful and relentless, a study of male bodies in sweaty motion and masculine emotions in teary turmoil.But like the brutal, brawling sport that provides Mr. O’Connor with a backdrop, a storehouse of metaphors and a pretext for staging some viscerally effective fight scenes, “Warrior” possesses surprising poetry and finesse. Which is not to say that it is subtle. The director’s impressive technique — and all the grace and discipline of his excellent, hard-working cast — is mustered with a single, unambiguous goal in mind. This movie wants to knock you out. It will.Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a dedicated educator and a devoted family man. His students adore him, and so does his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison). But Brendan’s roots and his future are entangled in more violent pursuits. He used to be something of a big deal on the mixed martial arts circuit, and now, to make some extra money — and perhaps also to find an outlet for the rage that simmers behind his kindly eyes and gentle grin — he fights for cash in parking lots. As hard as they work, Brendan and Tess have trouble staying afloat. They are, indeed, under water, carrying debt on their modest house in Philadelphia that is much larger than its post-real-estate-bubble value. And one of their children requires expensive medical care.Meanwhile Tommy (Tom Hardy), Brendan’s estranged younger brother, returns to the modest house in Pittsburgh where they grew up. Years before, Tommy and their mother (whose maiden name he has adopted) fled the boys’ abusive, alcoholic father, Paddy, a wrestling coach played with growling, broken-down grandeur by Nick Nolte. Tommy, a former Marine who served in Iraq, is not looking for reconciliation. He’s looking for a fight, and without forgiving his sobered-up, apologetic dad, he engages the old man’s professional services as he prepares to go into the ring.Unbeknownst to each other, both Tommy and Brendan — who is coached by an old friend (Frank Grillo) — are training for Sparta, a $5 million, winner-take-all tournament. Every sports movie needs a Big Game, and in Mr. O’Connor’s hands Sparta becomes a frenzied, fleshy opera: a grand, grunting, assaultive spectacle of redemption and revenge.Tommy’s style of fighting recalls that of the young, unbeatable Mike Tyson. He attacks with a combination of speed and strength that turns an opponent’s bravado into fear in a matter of seconds. Brendan relies more on technical finesse and a capacity to withstand punishment. Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgerton — an Englishman and an Australian playing a pair of Irish-American he-men — are physically potent actors, but the key to the movie’s effectiveness lies in their ability to convey fragility. These are tough guys, but you can only care about them if you believe that they can break.At the basic level of plot, what will happen at Sparta is never really in doubt. Though there are other imposing fighters in the Spartan ranks — including a fearsome Russian who recalls (though he does not physically resemble) Dolph Lundgren in “Rocky IV” — it is obvious that the bad brotherly blood between Tommy and Brendan can be expiated only one way, in a final showdown.Mr. O’Connor, who wrote the “Warrior” screenplay with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman, knows perfectly well that surprise is not the essence of sports-movie suspense. A few years back he directed “Miracle,” a rousing reconstruction of one of the most celebrated athletic moments in recent history, the 1980 victory of the underdog United States Olympic ice hockey team over its fearsome Soviet rival. It’s not as if knowing the outcome of the real story diminishes that movie’s impact. On the contrary, the sense of inevitability and improbability makes its triumphant finish all the more cathartic.The engine of inevitability in “Warrior” is not history but fate. Paddy’s constant companion in his lonely, sober old age is an audio-book version of “Moby-Dick.” That novel’s theme of monomaniacal, violent obsession and the Shakespearean cadences of its prose underline what is happening on screen in a way that is only occasionally heavy-handed. (And in any case a good fight picture, like a good fighter, can benefit from a heavy hand.) Brendan, Tommy and Paddy uphold traditional family values — the tradition, that is, of Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, King Lear and the fallen houses of ancient Greek tragedy.But if there is something primal and archaic in Mr. O’Connor’s fable of fathers and sons, he nonetheless grounds it in the painful realities of contemporary America. With arresting honesty and enormous compassion — but without making a big topical deal out of it — “Warrior” looks at an American working class reeling from the one-two punch of war and recession. Tommy and Brendan are too proud for self-pity, which makes the evident pain of their circumstances all the more affecting.They fight because every other way of being a man has been compromised, undermined or taken away. Patriarchal authority, as represented by Paddy, is cruel and unbending until it turns sentimental and pathetic. The roads to an honorable life promised by work and military service are mined and muddied by the greed and mendacity of the institutions — government, schools, banks — that are supposed to uphold integrity.In such conditions stripping down to your shorts and beating another guy senseless can seem not only logical, but also noble. The mock-gladiatorial theatrics of mixed martial arts may look tawdry and overblown, but the sport, perhaps even more than boxing, expresses a deep and authentic impulse to find meaning through the infliction and acceptance of pain. While the Conlon brothers are both fighting for the money, the real stakes are much deeper. Though their climactic confrontation is terrifyingly violent, it is also tender. And the most disarming thing about “Warrior” is that, for all its mayhem, it is a movie about love.“Warrior” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of fighting.WARRIOROpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Gavin O’Connor; written by Mr. O’Connor, Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman, based on a story by Mr. O’Connor and Mr. Dorfman; director of photography, Masanobu Takayanagi; edited by John Gilroy, Sean Albertson, Matt Chessé and Aaron Marshall; music by Mark Isham; production design by Dan Leigh; costumes by Abigail Murray; produced by Gavin O’Connor and Greg O’Connor; released by Lionsgate.

414,2017-07-21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:27,A.O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Valerian’ Is a Rave in Space (but Not Much Fun),"Much as I hesitate to predict the future in such crazy times, I feel I can say with certainty that 2017 will go down in film history as the Year of the Crazy Dane DeHaan Movie. Already so far we have seen Mr. DeHaan, a 31-year-old actor endowed with poise, intelligence and superb eyebrows, in Gore Verbinski’s highly puzzling “A Cure for Wellness.” If you missed that one, it was more or less “The Magic Mountain” with incest and bloodsucking eels.“Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,” Mr. DeHaan’s latest eyebrow-raiser — speaking of which, it also stars Cara Delevingne, perhaps the supreme superciliary celebrity of our time — is a bit harder to describe. It was written and directed by Luc Besson (“The Fifth Element,” “Arthur and the Invisibles”) a fact that promises greater emphasis on visual panache than on feeling or coherence.That promise is faithfully kept, but there is so much more going on. To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of “The Phantom Menace” into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea.Mr. DeHaan plays Valerian and Ms. Delevingne plays Laureline, who are not his-and-hers dental hygiene products but rather soldiers in some kind of space army. They are also at least potentially a couple, a fact which authorizes a lot of dialogue that might technically be called “banter” but that seems to have lost its snap after passing through Google translate a few times too many. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are as cute as a pair of baby salamanders.Their mission — do I have to do this part? — involves justice for the planet Mül. Before it was destroyed, Mül was a beachy paradise, a perpetual Ibiza on the morning after the best rave ever, populated by hairless lizard supermodels. The key to their bliss is a pocket-size dinosaur that excretes pearls. Only one is left in the universe. Valerian and Laureline are its intrepid pet-sitters.What about the City of a Thousand Planets? It’s a multicultural celestial metropolis where our heroes do a bit of chasing and fighting, and its population includes some fine specimens of modern digital and prosthetic creature design as well as a few that are a bit, let’s say, problematic. The City might be an interesting place to spend some time if a busy and chaotic story didn’t keep getting in the way, and if we were allowed to hang out for a little while longer with Ethan Hawke and Rihanna.She’s in this movie! Believe the posters, even though she shows up late and leaves early. She’s called Bubble, she dances on a stripper pole and changes costumes in the blink of an eye until Mr. Besson’s script cruelly casts her aside. Why? So we can ponder the villainy of Clive Owen in uniform? So we can watch Mr. DeHaan and Ms. Delevingne doing their finger-puppet Rock Hudson/Doris Day act? So we can come up with names for Valerian and Laureline’s babies?I don’t know, and I suspect Mr. Besson doesn’t either. Though it is based on a popular graphic novel series by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières, “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets” feels as if it were made up on the spot, by someone so delighted by the gaudy genre packaging at his disposal that he lost track of what was supposed to be inside.",0,,,1

Investigating our casual surrender of privacy rights every time we click the “Agree” button on those dense (and typically unread) online user contracts, the director Cullen Hoback outlines the real-life dangers of digital heedlessness. As the film illustrates, a random tweet or innocent Google search could summon a SWAT team to your door or transform you into a suspected terrorist.Actual horror stories aside, this concise and lively summary of the many ways corporations, law enforcement and government agencies gather, share and use our information — assisted by digital giants like AT&T and Google — is creepily unnerving.“Anonymity isn’t profitable,” one of the film’s more than 30 interviewees points out, and whether it’s cameras on Main Street or preinstalled software on your smartphone recording every keystroke, there has been an alarming rise in surveillance programs. While legal rulings on the programs remain shrouded in secrecy, they continue to serve multiple purposes, from attracting profits to deterring whistle-blowers and identifying protesters. If you’re planning a revolution — or just a political discussion group — better not tweet the location.Lightening the mood with clips from “South Park” and “Minority Report” (being arrested precrime is no longer science fiction), Mr. Hoback shows how digital executives like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook actively guard their own privacy while playing fast and loose with ours. Perfectly timed to coincide with the Edward J. Snowden brouhaha, “Terms and Conditions” wonders if our right to privacy has been lost forever. And, perhaps more saliently, if anyone cares.",1,55594.0,,1

Watching it is like gorging on a hot- fudge sundae in the good old days when few worried about sugar and fat. There are no bogus geopolitics weighing it down with a spurious relevance. Beautifully written and acted, “Tell No One” is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost.The story, which involves murder and depravity in high places, is so elaborately twisty that about halfway through the movie you stop trying to figure it out and let its polluted waters wash over you, trusting that the denouement will reveal all. It does and it doesn’t. When the truth spills out,  and ugly revelations pile onto one another in an extended final confession, the puzzle pieces fit more snugly than those of “The Big Sleep,” the granddaddy of impenetrable noirs. But one of the pleasures of both films is surrendering to a vision of corruption and evil that resists tidy explanations.The protagonist, Alex Beck (François Cluzet), is a kindhearted pediatrician in Paris who goes out of his way to help the poor in the clinic where he works. He is also a spiritual cousin of Scottie Ferguson from “Vertigo” in his obsession with a woman who may or may not be dead.As the story begins, he and his wife, Margot (Marie-Josée Croze), are revisiting the remote country lake where they spent summers as children and became sweethearts who carved their initials on a tree. Blissfully married decades later, they return to swim nude in the moonlight, then sprawl on the offshore raft where they have a minor squabble about real estate. Margot abruptly departs and disappears into the woods. A minute later Alex hears a stifled cry. Scrambling to shore, he is struck on the head while pulling himself out of the water. He remains in a coma for three days.While Alex, who was inexplicably pulled to shore, recuperates, Margot’s father, Jacques (André Dussollier), an imperious police inspector, identifies his daughter’s body in the woods. In the film’s most wrenching moment Alex comes apart in a drunken reverie remembering her cremation, as Jeff Buckley’s version of the early-’50s torch song “Lilac Wine” is heard on the soundtrack.On the eighth anniversary of Margot’s death, Alex, still numb with grief, is interrogated by the police after two bodies are unearthed near the site of her murder, along with a key to a safe-deposit box that contains incriminating photos and a bloodstained weapon that connects him to Margot’s death.Simultaneously, Alex begins receiving anonymous e-mail messages directing him to a Webcam video of a woman who appears to be Margot, gazing anxiously into a surveillance camera. An attached message warns:  “Tell no one. They’re watching.” He begins a desperate undercover search for the woman, suddenly believing Margot may still be alive.“Tell No One” is the second feature film directed by Mr. Canet, whose 2002 satire, “My Idol,” examined the warped mind of a sadistic producer of reality television. In that movie Mr. Canet played the producer’s aspiring young assistant forced to be his boss’s court jester (and his wife’s part-time lover) at a sinister country estate with a carnivorous aviary. Mr. Canet also appears briefly in “Tell No One” as the debauched son of Gilbert Neuville (Jean Rochefort), a billionaire politician and horse-racing magnate whose tentacles extend in every direction. In the film François Berléand, who played the producer in “My Idol,” portrays a sympathetic police investigator in charge of Alex’s case.The characters encompass a wide swath of Parisian society. Alex’s confidante and best friend, Hélène (Kristin Scott Thomas),  is the wealthy lover of his secretive younger sister, Anne (Marina Hands), a competitive equestrian. Through Hélène, Alex acquires a high-powered defense lawyer (Nathalie Baye), who begins to doubt Alex’s innocence after he flees the police.Just as Alex is about to be taken into custody, a gangster  (Gilles Lellouche), whose hemophiliac son’s life was saved by Alex in the clinic, rescues him and spirits him to a safe hiding place in a working-class suburb where young toughs delight in foiling the police. The rescue follows a thrilling chase sequence  worthy of “North by Northwest.” Like that 1959 classic, “Tell No One” is about an innocent man on the run with nowhere to turn. Mr. Cluzet may not be Cary Grant, but he is a convincing Everyman with a heart and soul stretched to the breaking point.“Tell No One” is pure, nasty fun. I watched it twice. It was even better the second time.TELL NO ONEOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Directed by Guillaume Canet; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Mr. Canet and Philippe Lefebvre, based on the novel by Harlan Coben; director of photography, Christophe Offenstein; edited by Hervé de Luze; music by -M-;  production designer, Philippe Chiffre; produced by Alain Attal; released by Music Box Films.

Curious gamers loved the scavenger hunt/ sub-Pynchon intrigues, engineered by benevolent creators representing a supposed organization; we learn about it, a little, which is not quite the same as playing along.Participants, tickled pink in interviews and video, underwent a mock induction, then followed cryptic instructions by notes and radio to visit a chapel, dance in public, lead a parade, even rescue someone in a tunnel. Mr. McCall keeps up an air of mystery and discovery, festooning shots of the city with loony voice-over directions, dropping pseudoscientific jargon and playful insinuations of cult activity, and featuring explanatory interviews that never entirely shake the feeling that we’re being put on.The Jejune Institute (as it was called) may well have been a liberating, if scripted, experience. Seeing the project crumpled into a quixotic movie, however, we’re simply sitting and watching other people play games. That can be interesting when we know the rules (sports) and sometimes when we don’t (the films of Jacques Rivette). But “The Institute” stumbles between documentary and exploratory simulation, at once confusing and pedantic. Personally, I prefer “Céline and Julie Go Boating.”",0,,,0
418,2015-06-24,"What Happened, Miss Simone?","Nina Simone, Lisa Simone Kelly, Roger Nupie, Al Schackman",USA,Liz Garbus,"Documentary, Biography, Music","English, French",75.0,101.0,,2015,7.6,9595.0,88.0,2017-11-02 04:18:21,MANOHLA DARGIS,"Review: &#8216;What Happened, Miss Simone?&#8217; Documents Nina Simone&#8217;s Rise as Singer and Activist","Partway through “What Happened, Miss Simone?,” an often electric, bracingly urgent documentary on the singer-musician Nina Simone, we reach that catastrophic year 1968, and the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On screen, photographs of other murdered black men flicker past — Malcolm X, the civil rights activist Medgar Evers and the Black Panther Fred Hampton — followed by a photo of a young black mourner holding a sign that reads: “You better kill all blacks.” I can’t be the only American who will despair at the relevance of those words in 2015.History changes our relationship with art, and when “What Happened, Miss Simone?” played at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it came across as a good, smart movie; now, in June — after nine black churchgoers were murdered by a suspect who claims to be a white supremacist — it feels like something altogether different. Simone started singing and playing piano in a New Jersey bar in 1954, the year of Brown v. Board of Education. By the time she had a hit in 1959, with the standard “I Loves You Porgy,” Emmett Till was dead, Rosa Parks had refused to give up her seat, and federal troops were protecting black students in Little Rock, Ark. A decade later, Simone’s songbook included “Four Women” (with the lyric “my skin is black”) and “To Be Young, Gifted and Black.” Directed by Liz Garbus, “What Happened, Miss Simone?” begins in 1976, with Simone performing at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. (The movie opens in theaters on Wednesday and will be available to stream on Netflix on Friday.) She had moved to Liberia two years earlier, a willing exile from the United States. “The America I’d dreamed of through the ’60s seemed like a bad joke,” she wrote in her 1991 memoir, “with Nixon in the White House and the black revolution replaced by disco.” Her memoir, “I Put a Spell on You” (written with Stephen Cleary), is part of a small if growing body of Simone studies that has swelled in recent years and includes assorted published histories and “Nina,” an unreleased biographical movie starring Zoe Saldana as the singer.The biopic will face a tough reception, partly because of the controversy over the casting of Ms. Saldana, whose skin was darkened for the role. If that doesn’t give you pause, then consider the words of Simone’s daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, who in “What Happened” says that while her mother rarely talked about how race affected her childhood, she was told that “her nose was too big, her lips were too full, and her skin too dark.” For Simone and the country she lived in and left, the country that made her famous when she played one role and rejected her when she played another, appearances were never just skin deep; they cut to the bone of her existence, much like her voice.That voice, purring or in full roar, anchors “What Happened,” which traces Simone’s life from her early childhood as a piano prodigy named Eunice Waymon to her troubled years — mentally, physically, spiritually — and finally her later return to glory. Ms. Garbus draws heavily on Simone’s personal history — family photos, diary entries — which she pieces together with generic archival images, news reports, concert footage, talking-head interviews and some needless dramatizations of a girl walking or at the piano. The clips of the real Simone singing and playing are flat-out wonderful. These span the entertainment gamut and include a somewhat surreal scene of her singing “I Loves You Porgy” on Hugh Hefner’s early-1960s television show, “Playboy’s Penthouse,” to a room filled with mostly white people in evening dress.As her fame grew, so did her social circle and civil rights activism. Her metamorphosis culturally and politically features a glittering cast of figures — James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry, among others — and makes for thrilling viewing. There’s a short clip of her singing “Mississippi Goddam” to Selma marchers in 1965; I’m pretty sure that’s Coretta Scott King watching in the lower right corner of the frame. For Simone, these were profound, life- and soul-changing times. “I don’t mind going without food or sleep as long as I am doing something worthwhile to me such as this,” she wrote in her diary. These entries can be eye-opening, yet they also can feel too intrusive, particularly as she struggles with what may have been bipolar disorder. Like a lot of documentarians, Ms. Garbus lets her choices speak for her, and she occasionally errs, both in some of her sight-and-sound juxtapositions and by folding in too much of Simone’s ex-husband, Andrew Stroud, who tends to run down his wife and her politics. Ms. Garbus also stumbles when she combines images of Black Panther members with Mr. Stroud grousing about Simone and what he calls, unchallenged, “extreme militant terrorists.” What’s missing are dialectics. Because when you see Simone read an unidentified poem at a 1969 festival in Harlem that asks, “Are you ready to kill, if necessary?,” she didn’t do so as a solitary black woman. She was reading a work by David Nelson, a member of a radical group of artists, and she was speaking for many. I imagine she still is.",0,,,1

The film, by Justin Bare and Matthew Miele, would be better if it spent less time gushing about how great Mr. Benson is and more time confronting some of the questions his approach raises.Mr. Benson, a Scotsman now in his late 80s, has taken photographs for People, Life and numerous other publications. He may be best known for a sequence he shot of the Beatles having a pillow fight in a hotel room in 1964.Mr. Benson tells stories about other memorable photographs and how he got them, and many celebrities, politicians and other figures praise his work. A number of them consider him a friend, we’re told repeatedly, and that raises an issue the film never really addresses. If you’re shooting portraits at Sears, sure, cozy up to your subjects, but if you fancy yourself a photojournalist, more detachment seems prudent. The film occasionally nods to this issue but leaves it underexplored.It also doesn’t scrutinize the role of Mr. Benson’s photography in furthering celebrity culture. He did serious work — documenting famine in Somalia in the 1980s, for instance — but the emphasis here is on his celebrity shots. Is taking pictures of O. J. Simpson naked in a locker room the best use of a photographer’s skills and time? In this adulatory film, no one ever asks.",0,17839.0,,1

One character, John Whittaker (Ben Barnes), a dewy English upper-class twit who brings his glamorous, somewhat older new American wife, Larita (Jessica Biel), home to meet his poisonous family, is so enamored of the songs that snippets of the lyrics seep into his dialogue.It may be a cute device that works for a while, but Mr. Elliott, who wrote the screenplay with Sheridan Jobbins, overuses it in a movie whose breathless, hyperkinetic style harks back to his 1994 comedy, “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.” (Since then Mr. Elliott has directed only two features, “Welcome to Woop Woop” and “Eye of the Beholder.”)This movie’s insistent jazz-age lilt is ultimately at odds with a play written in 1924  that attacks the hypocrisy, smugness and benighted values of the English landed gentry between the wars. The screenplay includes scattered Coward bons mots, but the witticisms don’t come as thick or as fast as in his later plays.“Easy Virtue” follows the travails of Larita, a brash, beautiful, widowed race-car driver from Detroit whom John meets in Monaco and impulsively marries.  John’s mother, Veronica (Kristin Scott Thomas), is predisposed to loathe her new daughter-in-law. And from the moment Larita steps out of John’s BMW roadster onto the Whittaker estate, she campaigns for Larita’s undoing.In its cold-eyed assessment of the English aristocracy “Easy Virtue” has none of the lurking Anglophilia found in Merchant-Ivory movies. The interior of the castle on the family’s 400-acre estate is shabby and filled with lumpy furniture that is as ugly as it is uncomfortable looking. Except for a Thanksgiving dinner that Veronica arranges, the food is unappetizing.Ms. Scott Thomas, deglamorized to play Veronica, is an embittered, snobbish dragon lady who derides Larita as a “floozy.” Larita’s allergy to pollen — she sneezes when given a tour of the castle’s attached greenhouse — symbolizes the unbreachable divide between the two women. Her gift of a Cubist painting turns out to be exactly the wrong present.Veronica’s husband, Jim (Colin Firth), disheveled and unshaven, spends his days tinkering in his automotive workshop. In the film’s most poignant moment he recalls the slaughter of all the men under his command during World War I. After the war this self-described member of “the romantic lost generation” drifted around France carousing and having affairs.John, the family’s golden boy, may be charming, but once in the shadow of his possessive mother, his independence and resolve dissipate rapidly. His two dreary sisters, Hilda (Kimberley Nixon) and Marion (Katherine Parkinson), both under Veronica’s thumb, become allies in her campaign to destroy his marriage. The little melodramas that erupt in the Whittaker household loom large. There is an accident involving the family’s Chihuahua for which Larita takes the blame; a local revue in which one daughter, at Larita’s supposed behest, scandalizes the family by dancing a can can without her scanties; a fox hunt in which the ever-spirited Larita, who abhors hunting as a blood sport, rides a motorcycle instead of a horse.As scandalous secrets are uncovered about Larita’s first marriage to a much older man who died of cancer, her callow young husband, with whom she has a spicy sex life, begins to withdraw. The movie uses ingenious visual symbols —  curved oval mirrors and stuffed animal heads —  to suggest the Whittakers’ warped Victorian values and the deadness of a culture Larita finds unendurable. You wouldn’t want to spend an afternoon with the dull, doughy-looking local gentry who attend the Whittakers’ parties.If Coward, later in his career, became an eloquent defender of all things English, “Easy Virtue” suggests that the ardent patriotism that took hold in the ’30s and ’40s had yet to assert itself.  The free-spirited Larita —  and by implication, America itself —  represents the brave new future; the Whittakers and all they stand for might as well be extinct.“Easy Virtue” is rated  PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.EASY VIRTUEOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Stephan Elliott; written by Mr. Elliott and Sheridan Jobbins, based on the play by Noël Coward; director of photography, Martin Kenzie; edited by Sue Blainey; music by Marius de Vries; production designer, John Beard; produced by Barnaby Thompson, Joe Abrams and James D.

Instead of Italy in the 1920s, the place of renewal is Jaipur, India, and the time is now.Its seven travelers are financially distressed men and women of retirement age lured by an invitation to “outsource” themselves for a stay at the newly opened Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur. Upon arrival, they discover a place that is far from the luxurious retreat “for the elderly and beautiful” that its advertising claims. But after much grumbling, most of them take it in stride and begin to flourish.With a cast that includes Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy, this leisurely paced two-hour movie is a reasonably tasty banquet for the same Anglophiles who embrace “Downton Abbey.” Although it’s not as tidy or comfy as that self-congratulating fantasy of British noblesse oblige or as elevated as the Merchant-Ivory films set in India, it’ll do nicely.Directed by John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love”), from a screenplay by Ol Parker and based on Deborah Moggach’s novel “These Foolish Things,” it begins with brief sketches of the travelers. Evelyn Greenslade (Ms. Dench), whose blog entries, read aloud, set the movie’s timeline, is a recent widow forced to sell her home after learning that her husband squandered their nest egg. Evelyn is a game, can-do woman who is first glimpsed in England trying to communicate over the telephone with a robotic operator at an Indian call center. Once in Jaipur, she takes a satisfying job instructing workers at a similar center on how to converse with overseas callers.Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Mr. Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are a quarrelsome couple who sank their life savings into their daughter’s failing start-up. Jean’s refusal to leave the hotel once they arrive, and her rejection of all things Indian while her husband happily explores the nearby temples, precipitate an inevitable explosion.Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) and Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) are adventurous older singles on the prowl for romance. At one point Madge tries to talk her way into an exclusive Indian club by claiming to be Princess Margaret, who, she is brusquely informed, died several years earlier. Norman, who in an early scene finds himself humiliated at a speed-dating event, is an indefatigable rogue with a pocket of Viagra.Graham Dashwood (Mr. Wilkinson), a retired High Court judge, grew up in Jaipur and is returning there for the first time since his youth. A gay man “more in theory than in practice nowadays,” as he puts it, Graham hopes to reconnect with his youthful Indian lover, whose family was disgraced when their affair was discovered.Muriel Donnelly (Ms. Smith), a xenophobic, racist termagant and retired housekeeper in need of a hip replacement, makes the trip because the surgery in India is cheaper and doesn’t entail a monthslong wait. The character has the screenplay’s meanest and snappiest lines, but it is beyond even Ms. Smith’s capacity to make Muriel’s eventual metamorphosis, from monster into sweet, caring old lady who befriends a low-caste Indian servant, remotely credible.Their host, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), is a wildly disorganized but enthusiastic young man who neglected to inform his guests ahead of time that the hotel has no working telephones and that some rooms are without doors. Mr. Patel (the lead in “Slumdog Millionaire”) is the movie’s comic grounding wire, whose hyperkinetic performance verges on slapstick. Sonny, under intense pressure from his haughty, domineering mother to give up the hotel and agree to an arranged marriage in Delhi, is in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae), a call center worker.The screenplay does a reasonably skillful job of interweaving its subplots and of creating some mild surprises. This is a programmatically feel-good movie whose tempered optimism and insistence that it’s never too late to leave your comfort zone and explore new horizons stays mostly (but not always) on the safe side of sentimentality. Besides its sterling cast, its ace in the hole is its pungent depiction of Jaipur’s teeming streets, which give an otherwise well-mannered movie a blinding splash of color.“The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild sexual situations.",1,46377022.0,46383639.0,0

BhattacharyaOne hour; not ratedThe title card at the beginning of “Rabindranath Tagore: The Poet of Eternity” assures us that the film is “a pro bono, noncommercial project” meant for schools and students. They deserve better, and so does Tagore (1861-1941), the Bengali poet, songwriter, musician, playwright, painter, philosopher and teacher who won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature.ImageRabindranath TagoreCreditPartha BhattacharyaDirected by Partha Bhattacharya, this hourlong documentary is full of encomiums and snippets of performances from the Tagore sesquicentennial in 2011. But the movie is so eager to convince us of Tagore’s greatness as a universal soul (it was Tagore, by the way, who gave Gandhi the name “mahatma,” or great soul) that it fails to give us the man or a clear sense of context. When, toward the end of the movie, we hear Tagore, with his flowing white beard, singing in a scratchy black-and-white clip, his high, light voice is surprising: You’re expecting the basso profundo of God himself.Though clearly a labor of love by Mr. Bhattacharya, “Tagore” is mostly clumsy as filmmaking. He gives us talking heads (the Dalai Lama and Prince Charles, among others) or shows us photographs of the long-dead famous — Albert Schweitzer, Bertrand Russell, Jane Addams — with words down the side and a voice intoning, “Bertrand Russell said ...”One thing that’s missing is a sense of Tagore’s reception in the modern world, beyond concerts and Unesco. Although he is still immensely influential in Bengal and east India, his star has dimmed in the West. Why? The economist Amartya Sen, who appears briefly in the movie, has written elegantly and persuasively on Tagore and that topic. His 1997 article in The New York Review of Books would be an excellent place for interested students to start a study.",0,,,1

Elgar’s stately march becomes an ironic refrain to the misadventures and regrets of the three recurring characters, two men and a woman, who navigate different stages in their lives at a film school. The unsubtle musical theme is also a sharp contrast to Mr. Hong’s casually brilliant feat of storytelling, akin to an ingeniously wrought suite of literary short fiction.The cycle, both comedic and poignant, begins with Jingu (Lee Sun-kyun), a disgruntled film teacher in his 30s, as he bickers with his wife over social plans. Jingu belongs to the hapless brotherhood that Mr. Hong has assembled and refined over a 12-movie oeuvre that includes “Woman Is the Future of Man”: young souls blundering through romantic and professional exchanges, not yet really where they want to be, and, through a mix of cluelessness, libido and misapplied principles, staying there.These guys often bear artistic aspirations and their hearts on their sleeves but range across a spectrum of likability. The scarf-wrapped Jingu — who browbeats a student (“Your sincerity needs a form”) and proclaims unbidden to a cute photographer in a park that he is a filmmaker — at first comes across as comically pompous and a little pathetic. But when he drunkenly embarrasses a professor at an outing with colleagues, and at a screening of his own movie is grilled over past personal indiscretions, it’s hard not to feel a little for his face plants.So fizzles the tale of Jingu the teacher, but what Mr. Hong does with the subsequent segments reconfirms him as one of contemporary cinema’s freshest innovators in narrative form, restlessly (and meaningfully) exploring point of view and how life does and doesn’t add up.That means not just switching vantages among characters but also within individual experience. The next portion of “Oki’s Movie” unceremoniously clicks back to Jingu as a film student (Mr. Lee again). Not yet overcompensating for career disappointments, Jingu spends his free time relentlessly pursuing a schoolmate, Oki (Jung Yu-mi), and plays down an echo chamber of rumors about a filmmaking prize that he might receive as the favored student of the respected Professor Song.The film shifts gears twice more: first to delve into the world of Song (Moon Sung-keun), reduced by a snowstorm to teaching a class of two starry-eyed pupils (Jingu and Oki), and finally to seeing things through Oki’s eyes. With her segment, also titled “Oki’s Movie,” Oki reflects on her relationships, analyzing separate strolls she took with Jingu and Song on the same park path. Mr. Hong, an avowed admirer of François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, outdoes himself here, neatly upturning our perspective on the vagaries of allegedly grown men.All of which might sound schematic on paper, but one of Mr. Hong’s qualities, underrated of late, is a self-effacing yet deeply considered style, applied in this movie to episodes as vivid and offhand as journal recollections (perhaps the filmmaker’s). A park, an anonymous restaurant, a street curb serve as quotidian settings for the stories’ rendezvous. Bracingly light on scene-setting cues, this 80-minute feature gets in and gets out, a model of editorial economy by a formidable sketch artist.The compact parts of Mr. Hong’s film can seem to fit together abruptly, without tidy explanation, and that may be partly why it has taken time for “Oki’s Movie” to find a run in an American theater. But to recall Jingu’s words, Mr. Hong has found yet another stimulating form for sincerity, not to mention irony and insight, and it’s worth savoring.",1,,,0

With its global brand recognition, “Jurassic World” comes with more muscle than the average big-ticket behemoth, one that’s been built on best-selling novels, three earlier flicks, theme-park attractions and the usual marketing tie-ins. Once again, dinosaurs are on the roam, an unpeaceable kingdom that is an index of the folly of man trying to play God. In reality, there’s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn’t take the reins on this.Mr. Spielberg may not have directed “Jurassic World,” but his fingerprints — and anxiety over his influence — are all over it. He’s one of its executive producers and gave his blessing to the director Colin Trevorrow, who has just one other feature on his résumé, the indie “Safety Not Guaranteed.” As is the case with every filmmaker hired to lead an industrial brand to box-office domination, Mr. Trevorrow was principally tasked with delivering “Jurassic World” in salable shape, which he has done. Actors repeat their bad lines without smirking, and digital dinosaurs stomp, scatter and gulp amid product placements for Triumph motorcycles and Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville chain. There are so many plugs for Mercedes that you may wonder if the targeted viewers are studio executives.That would be par for the course in an entertainment that’s as relentlessly reflexive as this one. Cinema is an insistently self-referential art (movies about movies being just one example), and filmmakers have long enjoyed drawing attention to the fact that, hey, you’re watching the big screen. Given Mr. Spielberg’s heavy shadow, it’s no surprise that “Jurassic World” almost immediately if obliquely nods at antecedents, including the first two he directed, with a character in the new one stating that “every time we’ve unveiled a new attraction attendance has spiked.” She’s talking about the movie’s dinosaur theme park, but she might as well be referring to all the special effects and other blockbuster add-ons that moviemakers use to try to blow the audience’s collective mind.Blowing minds rather than, you know, telling a good story is the driving imperative in “Jurassic World,” which takes place on an island turned luxury resort where thousands enjoy a very special kind of eco-tourism. There, the usual suspects convene, including a pair of bland young brothers (Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins), avatars for the sought-after demographic; the usual odd-couple cuties (Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt); and some standard-issue villainy that exists to feed the dinosaurs and our bloodlust. It’s a measure of how dumbed-down this movie is that while the three heroes in “Jurassic Park” were scientists, Mr. Pratt plays Owen, an indeterminate animal expert, and Ms. Howard plays Claire, a corporate stooge whose idiocy is partly telegraphed by her towering heels.The heels come across as a joke, or at least that’s how the filmmakers attempt to skew them, with Owen telling Claire that they’re “ridiculous.” That Claire can actually run from dinosaurs, over cement and through mud, without breaking a heel off or twisting her ankle like a film-noir dame, is played as a kind of triumph. Of course it’s a hollow one and it’s representative of how the filmmakers like to point out the very clichés (genre, gender, whatever) they embrace, as if merely acknowledging them were a critical move. By the time Claire is shooting a gun, still in heels, you may find yourself humming that old fake-feminist jingle: “I can bring home the bacon/ Fry it up in a pan/ And never let you forget you’re a man.” That Owen is the hero ensures that you’ll never forget, either.Dolling Claire up so preposterously is a glib tactic, although it’s unclear if the filmmakers were trying to tweak politically correct sensibilities or thought they were being clever, or maybe both. Whatever the case, the heels are just silly and a distraction given that they’re nowhere near as insulting as the rest of her. Owen may be a parody of a hunk, what with his greasy workingman hands, shirt-busting arm muscles and nicely coiffed chin hair, but at least he does cool stuff like wrangle raptors and, spoiler alert, Claire. She mostly just schemes and screams, before Owen melts her like an ice cube on a hot griddle, proving that, yes, she’s every bit as bad as Joss Whedon thought when on Twitter he called out “Jurassic World” as sexist: “She’s a stiff, he’s a life-force — really? Still?” Yes, still.Winking self-consciousness and movie love are Spielberg signatures and they suffuse “Jurassic Park,” which pivots on an entrepreneur cum carny, Hammond (Richard Attenborough, who directed “Gandhi”), who could be a stand-in for any Big Man of cinema. It’s Hammond who’s brought dinosaurs back to dangerous life, and while he has the vision thing down, he also likes to mention the money he’s spent on his spectacle, cementing the Hollywood analogy. By the end, his hubris nearly does him in and his plans flop, a cautionary fictional failure that spawned a real-life smash. Oh, the irony or, as one of the writers, David Koepp, said, “I was really chasing my tail there for a while trying to find out what was virtuous in this whole scenario — and eventually gave up.”Part of the pleasure of “Jurassic Park” is how seamlessly Mr. Spielberg’s deep love of movies worked with what was, back in 1993, bleeding-edge computer-generated imagery: the dinosaurs were cool, and the filmmaking fluid and vigorous. It’s a resolutely old-fashioned Hollywood adventure movie in many ways, but one that felt (feels) paradoxically alive because of Mr. Spielberg’s filmmaking talents and his absolute faith in movies. “Jurassic World,” by contrast, isn’t in dialogue with its cinematic reference points; it’s fossilized by them. From the first shot of a dinosaur hatching (signaling new beginnings, etc.) to one of a massive aquatic creature chowing down on a great white shark (get it?), it is clear that the only colossus that’s making the ground shake here is Steven Spielberg.“Jurassic World” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

425,2009-05-15,Tyson,"Mills Lane, Mike Tyson, Trevor Berbick, Cus D'Amato","USA, France",James Toback,"Documentary, Biography, Sport",English,83.0,90.0,James Toback,2008,7.5,11440.0,85.0,2017-11-02 04:18:09,A. O. SCOTT,Violence Embodied in a Boxer’s Rise and Fall,"The first thing you see in “Tyson,” James Toback’s powerful and troubling new documentary, is an old television clip showing Mike Tyson, on Nov. 22, 1986, defeating Trevor Berbick to win the W.B.C. heavyweight title. Just 20 years old, Mr. Tyson was the youngest fighter to win that belt, and to see him take it is to recall, especially in light of the shambling, thuggish caricature he would later become, what a dazzling and ferocious boxer he was in his prime.The only thing more astonishing than the speed of his combinations was their force, and his ability to blend quickness with brute strength quickly overpowered his early opponents, not many of whom lasted very long in the ring with him. Mr. Berbick, a taller, heavier and more experienced fighter, was done before the second round was over, and what the slow-motion video shows most indelibly is the terror on his face before the referee mercifully called a TKO.The essence of boxing is violence, but few fighters have refined it — have embodied it —  quite as effectively as Mr. Tyson has; he sometimes speaks to Mr. Toback’s camera about the murderous clarity he took into the ring with him. He says he used to imagine his fists smashing through his opponent’s faces and out the backs of their heads. The pure terror in Mr. Berbick’s eyes (and in those of most of the other fighters Mr. Tyson met during his rapid rise and brief reign) suggests that he might well have been capable of wreaking that kind of damage.But the damage surveyed in “Tyson” is mostly self-inflicted. Fear is certainly one of the film’s motifs, but it seems that Mr. Tyson suffers from at least as much as he inspires. “I’m afraid. I’m afraid. I’m afraid,” he says at one point, giving voice to his state of mind in the moments before a bout. He also remembers being bullied and humiliated as a child in Brooklyn, but in listening to his moody, rambling and frequently thoughtful disquisitions on his own life you are struck by intimations of a dread much deeper than the fear of physical harm or loss of face.With a single exception — his relationship with his trainer and mentor, Cus D’Amato — Mr. Tyson’s experience of the world has been marked by mistrust and suspicion, by a view of other people that is hard and pitiless. They are users, operators, “leeches,” he says, but he rarely claims to be any better. He is only human.Most of the movie consists of the former champ sitting in a house near the Pacific Ocean, speaking into the camera as if no one else were around. This produces an effect of almost unnerving intimacy — it is a bit scary to be so close to him — but also an upwelling, perhaps unexpected, of compassion. It is hard to imagine anyone more radically alone.Whether or not he deserves our sympathy is a fair question. It is easy, and not entirely unjustified, to look at Mr. Tyson, his left eye ringed by a Maori tattoo, his head shaved clean, and see a self-pitying, self-justifying man who squandered his talent and good fortune and caused much more hurt than his brutal profession required. He started out as a street criminal in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and was plucked from juvenile detention by Mr. D’Amato and his associates, who disciplined the young man’s natural volatility and turned him into a fighter.But Mr. Tyson never learned to control his brutish, self-destructive instincts. His brief first marriage, to the actress and model Robin Givens, was marked by accusations of abuse, and in 1993 he went to prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting a beauty pageant contestant in Indiana. By now he may be better known for ranting and press conferences and for biting Evander Holyfield’s ear during a 1997 fight than for the mighty pugilistic feats of his youth.And a lot of people, even passionate boxing fans, might prefer to forget about Mr. Tyson rather than spend 90 minutes in his company. But “Tyson” is worth seeing even if you have no particular interest in the sport or the man.It may lack the detachment and the balance that Barbara Kopple brought to “Fallen Champ: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson,” the 1993 documentary she made for NBC, but Mr. Toback’s film, partly because it restricts itself to Mr. Tyson’s point of view, offers a rare and vivid study in the complexity of a single suffering, raging soul. It is not an entirely trustworthy movie, but it does feel profoundly honest.From time to time the screen is divided into two or three almost identical images, and the sound is edited to make it sound as if Mr. Tyson is in dialogue with himself, his words echoing and overlapping. These effects emphasize the film’s main point, which is that Mr. Tyson is too mercurial, too self-contradictory, to be easily summed up.He is by turns boastful, angry, remorseful and bewildered, choking up when he recalls Mr. D’Amato, whose death in 1985 remains the central tragedy of Mr. Tyson’s life. He relates the details of that life with candor and feeling, and also with an analytical ardor that is moving because it reveals his struggle to figure himself out.Without the sympathetic presence of Mr. Toback, whom he has known for many years, it is unlikely that Mr. Tyson would have opened up in this way. And it is also likely that without Mr. Tyson’s presence, the director would have been unlikely to restrain his own self-indulgent impulses.Mr. Toback’s fascination with hyperbolic visions of masculinity predates his filmmaking career, going back at least to a notorious 1967 essay  on Norman Mailer. As a screenwriter and director — from “Fingers” to “Harvard Man” — he has been preoccupied with brutality, vanity and sexual conquest, and with the interplay between those elemental impulses and the refinements of art and culture.His protagonists tend to be variously romanticized versions of himself:  intellectuals seduced by fantasies of crime, risk, sexual wantonness and violence. Even in his most interesting projects he frequently loses track of the difference between exploring such fantasies and indulging them, but in “Tyson,” his first nonfiction film, he is held in check by the irreducible, excruciating realness of the man in front of the camera. The transaction between them is charged with a strange kind of magic. The filmmaker allows the fighter to have his unchallenged say to justify, condemn and contradict himself. In exchange Mr. Tyson has enabled Mr. Toback to make his best film, which is also, paradoxically, his most personal.“Tyson” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It has profanity and violence.TYSONOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by James Toback; director of photography, Larry McConkey; edited by Aaron Yanes; music by Salaam Remi, with the song “Legendary” by Nas; produced by Mr. Toback and Damon Bingham; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

O. SCOTT,The Darker Side of the Story,"I’m not sure this counts as a spoiler of anything other than Universal’s sleek and seductive marketing campaign — which has properly emphasized crows, swords and Charlize Theron’s hair — but there are actually some dwarfs in the new movie “Snow White and the Huntsman.” The small fellows who befriend the exiled princess here are nothing like the grumpy, sneezy, dopey guys you remember from the Disney version. The actors who play them (including Ian McShane, Eddie Marsan, Ray Winstone and the great Bob Hoskins, all digitally shrunken) might otherwise have been assembled for a nasty little Cockney gangster film. These dwarfs are industrious, but they don’t whistle while they work. Their most memorable song is a haunting dirge performed at the funeral pyre of a fallen comrade. So take note: There is nothing cute about this movie.And that feels right. There is something exciting about how seriously “Snow White and the Huntsman” takes its themes. Most of the fairy tales that have become fixtures of modern popular culture — including those, like “Snow White,” published by the Brothers Grimm in the early 19th century — emerged from the dark, violent folk landscape of early modern Europe. They are fables of innocence, but also of terror, dense with superstition and sexual anxiety. Walt Disney’s justly beloved 1937 animated feature, though it has some spooky, gothic visual touches, expelled most of the demons and turned the heroine into an emblem of chaste and cheerful domestic normalcy. Since then, Hollywood fairy tales have mainly tacked between wide-eyed romanticism and winking self-consciousness.“Snow White and the Huntsman,” directed by the first-timer Rupert Sanders from a script by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini, tries something new. Or maybe something old, even atavistic. Though it is an ambitious — at times mesmerizing — application of the latest cinematic technology, the movie tries to recapture some of the menace of the stories that used to be told to scare children rather than console them. Its mythic-medieval landscapes are heavily shadowed and austere, and its flights of magic are summoned from a zone of barely suppressed rage and dangerous power.Most of the power and nearly all of the rage belong to Ravenna, Ms. Theron’s golden-haired, furious queen. Having murdered the king on their wedding night and imprisoned his daughter in a tower, Ravenna preens in front of her liquid-metal mirror, plucks the hearts out of birds (with metal fingernail extensions apparently designed for that purpose) and terrorizes her subjects. She is loyally attended by her creepy brother, Finn (Sam Spruell) — a kind of Dorian Gray portrait of his flawless sister, the ugliness of whose soul seems inscribed on his leering, pitted face — but otherwise alone in the castle of her cruelty.The evil stepmothers of the past have been monsters of self-generating female narcissism, but Ravenna seems to be a woman with a legitimate grudge against a male-dominated world of sexual violence and patriarchal entitlement. With a slight shift of emphasis, “Snow White and the Huntsman” might have been her story, the tale of a victim turned righteous avenger. And it may be that being denied this status fuels Ravenna’s resentment. Her wrath is directed principally at other women: at the girls whose youth and beauty she steals to feed the spell that keeps her from aging, and at the blameless princess who threatens her simply by being young and alive.That would be Snow White, of course, played by Kristen Stewart at the precise point of intersection between action heroine and damsel in distress. Since Ms. Stewart has become, thanks to “Twilight,” the very embodiment of romantic indecision, there are two possible suitors chivalrously circling her. Or two unshaven dudes, at any rate, vying to protect her and dividing the audience into Team Handsome Prince and Team Huntsman.The “prince” is William (Sam Claflin), a childhood friend of Snow’s and the son of a nobleman who has remained loyal to the memory of her father. He is a gifted archer and a dashing enough young man, but there really is no contest. The movie is not called “Snow White and William.” The Huntsman, a hard-drinking, belligerent widower with no other name, has the advantage of being played by Chris Hemsworth — Thor! — with sly, gruff magnetism.After an overwrought beginning — during which drops of blood fall to the snow with a crash, and James Newton Howard’s score roars and howls like Wagner with a stubbed toe — the movie comes down to earth and springs to life when Mr. Hemsworth shows up. His huntsman, like the dwarfs, is a gruff human presence in a world that might otherwise have been too airily and abstractly fantastical.In turn, the roughness of those characters, along with the scratchy earth tones of Greig Fraser’s cinematography, make possible episodes of enchantment that feel fresh even to eyes that have seen everything under the digital sun. A terrifying slog through the dark forest, a serene sojourn in the garden of the fairies, a visit to an encampment of women and children — each of these scenes casts its own specific and effective spell.In this carefully imagined reality — the production designer, Dominic Watkins, has done exceptional work — Ms. Theron is, if not the fairest, then surely the most striking one of all. She has a remarkable ability to mix coldness and sorrow, and as the special effects etch lines on her face and then smooth them away, she at once invites and refuses sympathy. Ravenna, taught as a girl that beauty was the source of power, has made herself into a perfect aesthetic object and destroyed herself in the process. Snow White, rather than try to beat her in the contest of appearances, must create a new game, based on a different meaning of “fairness” and on her own modest, real-girl appeal.Ms. Stewart, stumbling through the forest and racing through an awkward, Shakespeare-lite speech to her hastily mustered good-guy army, understands the job perfectly and undertakes it in good faith. Her Snow White is part of an interesting new breed of warrior princesses — Katniss Everdeen is their current leader — whose ascendance reflects the convergence of commercial calculations and cultural longings. Long may they reign.“Snow White and the Huntsman” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Blood, monsters and whispers of sexual implication.",0,155081785.0,155136755.0,0

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Hidden Figures’ Honors 3 Black Women Who Helped NASA Soar,"“Hidden Figures” takes us back to 1961, when racial segregation and workplace sexism were widely accepted facts of life and the word “computer” referred to a person, not a machine. Though a gigantic IBM mainframe does appear in the movie — big enough to fill a room and probably less powerful than the phone in your pocket — the most important computers are three African-American women who work at NASA headquarters in Hampton, Va. Assigned to data entry jobs and denied recognition or promotion, they would go on to play crucial roles in the American space program.Based on Margot Lee Shetterly’s nonfiction book of the same title, the film, directed by Theodore Melfi (who wrote the script with Allison Schroeder), turns the entwined careers of Katherine Goble (later Johnson), Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan into a rousing celebration of merit rewarded and perseverance repaid. Like many movies about the overcoming of racism, it offers belated acknowledgment of bravery and talent and an overdue reckoning with the sins of the past. And like most movies about real-world breakthroughs, “Hidden Figures” is content to stay within established conventions. The story may be new to most viewers, but the manner in which it’s told will be familiar to all but the youngest.This is not necessarily a bad thing. There is something to be said for a well-told tale with a clear moral and a satisfying emotional payoff. Mr. Melfi, whose previous film was the heart-tugging, borderline-treacly Bill Murray vehicle “St. Vincent,” knows how to push our emotional buttons without too heavy a hand. He trusts his own skill, the intrinsic interest of the material and — above all — the talent and dedication of the cast. From one scene to the next, you may know more or less what is coming, but it is never less than delightful to watch these actors at work.Start with the three principals, whose struggles at NASA take place as the agency is scrambling to send an astronaut into orbit. Katherine Goble is the central hidden figure, a mathematical prodigy played with perfect nerd charisma by Taraji P. Henson. Katherine is plucked from the computing room and assigned to a team that will calculate the launch coordinates and trajectory for an Atlas rocket. She receives a cold welcome — particularly from an engineer named Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) — and is not spared the indignities facing a black woman in a racially segregated, gender-stratified workplace. The only bathroom she is allowed to use is in a distant building, and she horrifies her new co-workers when she helps herself to a cup of coffee.Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Monáe) also face discrimination. Dorothy, who is in charge of several dozen computers, is repeatedly denied promotion to supervisor and treated with condescension by her immediate boss (Kirsten Dunst). The Polish-born engineer (Olek Krupa) with whom Mary works is more enlightened, but Mary runs into the brick wall of Virginia’s Jim Crow laws when she tries to take graduate-level physics courses.“Hidden Figures” effectively conveys the poisonous normalcy of white supremacy, and the main characters’ determination to pursue their ambitions in spite of it and to live normal lives in its shadow. The racism they face does not depend on the viciousness or virtue of individual white people, and for the most part the white characters are not treated as heroes for deciding, at long last, to behave decently. Two of them, however, are singled out for commendation: John Glenn, portrayed by Glen Powell as a natural democrat with no time for racial hierarchies; and Al Harrison, the head of Katherine’s group, for whom the success of the mission is more important than color.Kevin Costner, who plays Al, is an actor almost uniquely capable of upstaging through understatement. He is also one of the great gum-chewers in American cinema, a habit that, along with the flattop haircut and heavy-framed glasses, gives Al an aura of midcentury no-nonsense masculine competence. He desegregates the NASA bathrooms with a sledgehammer and stands up for Katherine in quieter but no less emphatic ways when her qualifications are challenged.It’s a bit much, maybe, but Mr. Costner, as usual, does what he can to give the white men of America a good name. The movie, meanwhile, expands the schoolbook chronicle of the conquest of space beyond the usual heroes, restoring some of its idealism and grandeur in the process. It also embeds that history in daily life, departing from the televised spectacle of liftoffs and landings and the public drama of the civil rights movement to spend time with its heroines and their families at home and in church. The sweetest subplot involves the romance between Katherine, a widow with three daughters, and a handsome military officer played by Mahershala Ali.“Hidden Figures” makes a fascinating and timely companion to “Loving,” Jeff Nichols’s film about the Virginia couple who challenged their state’s law against interracial marriage, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967. The two movies take place in the same state in the same era, and focus on the quiet dramas that move history forward. They introduce you to real people you might wish you had known more about earlier. They can fill you with outrage at the persistence of injustice and gratitude toward those who had the grit to stand up against it.",0,169385416.0,169323813.0,1

One improbable thing leads to another, and suddenly the mouse is roaring, having been inducted into a sex club in which beautiful women in French lingerie crawl around on all fours as if auditioning for a remake of “9  ½ Weeks.” At one point a bony Michelle Williams shows up in a fabulous haircut and towering heels that would fell a lesser woman. Complications ensue.Directed by the first-timer Marcel Langenegger, whose background in advertising is belied by this movie’s sluggish pace, “Deception” was written by Mark Bomback, who did far better coming up with polysyllabic grunts and groans for Bruce Willis in “Live Free or Die Hard.” As written and directed, the characters in “Deception” are little more than avatars,  generic types (good guy, bad man, fatal blonde), that Mr. Langenegger moves from one busy setup to the next. The venerable cinematographer Dante Spinotti, whose credits include “The Insider,” here works with a dark, almost monochromatic palette and bathes the exteriors in an attractive gun-metal blue, but neither his work nor that of the expert production designer Patrizia von Brandenstein (“The Ice Harvest,” “A Simple Plan”) is enough to save the movie from itself.Cougar fans take note: Charlotte Rampling plays a sex club denizen, sometimes seminude.“Deception” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The first feature of its creative team, Tal Granit and Sharon Maymon, “The Farewell Party,” which won them an Ophir Award (the Israeli Oscar) for best direction, is set in a Jerusalem retirement home in which one resident, an amateur inventor, devises a “mercy-killing machine.” News of the device leaks to the home’s other residents. That inventor, Yehezkel, a robust bear of a man (Ze’ev Revah) and his wife, Levana (Levana Finkelshtein), a couple in their 70s, are distressed by the acute suffering of their friend Max (Shmuel Wolf), who is dying of cancer and against his will is kept alive by doctors. Max’s wife, Yana (Aliza Rozen), entreats Yehezkel to assist Max, however he can, in ending his agony.Enter Dr. Daniel (Ilan Dar), a retired veterinarian and a resident of the retirement home who has put down many animals. He agrees to help Yehezkel perfect the design of a machine that will allow Max to end his own life by pushing a button. Raffi (Rafael Tabor), a retired police officer, advises that a pretaped video from Max stating that he alone is responsible for his suicide will help avoid trouble with the law. But will it? The movie stops short of exploring the legalities.Among the members of the group, Levana, who has early-stage Alzheimer’s, is the only one who is morally opposed to euthanasia. But her attitude softens when she realizes to her horror that she is “disappearing.” Mr. Revah and Ms. Finkelshtein, who give the strongest performances, are touching as a deeply devoted couple.For all its sensitivity to the subject, “The Farewell Party” makes a number of tonal missteps of which the most glaring is the insertion of a musical number that upsets the movie’s otherwise sensible balance between the comedic and the morbid.",0,,,0
430,2012-06-29,Magic Mike,"Matthew McConaughey, Channing Tatum, Olivia Munn, Alex Pettyfer",USA,Steven Soderbergh,"Comedy, Drama",English,72.0,110.0,Reid Carolin,2012,6.1,120664.0,80.0,2017-11-02 04:18:15,MANOHLA DARGIS,The Body Politic,"The hip-pumping studs who work at the Xquisite dance club know a thing or two about making the ladies scream in delight. But nobody works the crowd like Magic Mike (a terrific Channing Tatum), the gyrating main attraction in Steven Soderbergh’s funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream. Then again, few directors can sell the goods — whether it’s Che in Cuba or Mike in a thong — as shrewdly as Mr. Soderbergh. A restive talent who toggles between big-studio and low-budget work, he has a genius for wrapping tricky ideas, like capitalism and its discontents, into commercial packages. Never before has he put them into cheek-baring chaps.Those cheeks, smooth as a hairless Chihuahua, will receive considerable attention, as will the rippling muscles, thrusting pelvises and the dancing, by turns snaky and acrobatic, that are on generous display in “Magic Mike.” Mr. Tatum, who shares producing credit (the movie was written by his production partner Reid Carolin), has said that the story is loosely based on his stint as a stripper in Florida, starting when he was 18, a college dropout and flopping on his sister’s couch. The dropout here is Adam (Alex Pettyfer), who’s crashing with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), while trying to get his life together. He receives unexpected help when he takes a job at a construction site, where he meets an older, regular employee, Mike, who’s initially contemptuous of the newcomer.But Mike has a heart of gold, which becomes evident as soon as he takes Adam under his wing, first at the construction site and then by bringing the younger man to Xquisite. Initially incredulous and unsettled at some of what he sees at the club, Adam changes his mind after he’s pushed onstage and, to the blunt throbbing of “Like a Virgin,” strips. He takes to the stage like an otter to water, slipping and sliding across it and into the lap of an obliging customer. When he comes offstage, a smile on his face and his saggy Jockeys stuffed with bills, he is a man reborn. It’s no wonder that, after this memorably frolicking night, Adam asks if he can be Mike’s best friend.What happens will be familiar if you’ve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie. An elastic genre popular in the 1920s and ’30s, these flicks usually involve a working-class young miss who comically scrambles or crudely tramps her way into a mink, swank digs and finally either tragedy or redemption, depending on whether she’s doomed or saved. Sometimes she also initiates an innocent into her life pretty much the same way Mike brings Adam into his world of sexual play, casual drug use and dance music. In the past the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here the stress is on Mike’s struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture.For the most part this isn’t a party scene built for doom, especially when Mike is dancing, bouncing and back-flipping. Set in Tampa (but also shot in California), a palm-lined wasteland that Mr. Soderbergh has washed in somewhat queasy-ugly bleached orange, the movie opens at the club with the owner-M.C., Dallas (a spectacular, amusingly sleazed-out Matthew McConaughey), running down the rules for the female clientele. “This is the ‘What can you touch and not touch’ rule,” Dallas says, the room erupting in appreciative woos. As he ticks off what customers can and can’t grope, his hands grab and graze different parts of his body, and then he wags a finger and repeatedly says “no.” “The law says that you cannot touch,” he continues. “But I think I see a lot of lawbreakers up in this house tonight.”The legal dos and don’ts suggest that the law of the father has been partly overthrown, even if the naughtiness remains hidden, away from the glare of the outside world. The club is something of a playground, a place where women and men teasingly, raucously switch traditional roles. Yet there’s a serious undertow to their interactions because the women pay men for a sexual pantomime that the men live off of. (The plot also involves Dallas’s plans to open a bigger club in which he’s promised Mike equity, a pledge that keeps Mike dancing and distracted from his own dreams.) From the way that Mr. Soderbergh shoots the opener, the lights shining into the camera and your eyes (you may flash on “All That Jazz”), it’s clear everyone is playing a role, including you.In “Magic Mike,” men exist to be looked at, and women do the looking, a reverse of the old cinematic divide between the sexes that finds so-called passive women who are looked at by so-called active men. In one school of thought Hollywood movies are always organized for the visual pleasure of the male spectator, which pretty much leaves the female spectator sidelined. There’s no leaving her out any longer — or the gay or confident heterosexual male spectator, either. From the way Mr. Soderbergh shoots the raunchy, often hilarious vamping dance scenes (Village People Plus), his camera lingering on the undulating bodies — the other strippers are played by Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Adam Rodriguez and Kevin Nash — it’s clear the director is out to maximize everyone’s pleasure.Much like Mr. Soderbergh’s movie, “Haywire,” starring Gina Carano, the mixed-martial-arts champ, “Magic Mike” is very much about the beauty of bodies in motion and the deep cinematic joys of watching good-looking people perform extraordinary physical feats. Since parting professional ways with George Clooney, whom Mr. Soderbergh helped transform into a star, the director has pinned some of his more severe projects to nonintuitive attractions like Ms. Carano and Sasha Grey, a former porn actress. He may have been bored with big stars, though that’s doubtful (there are a few headliners in “Haywire” and a boatload in “Contagion”). It may have been a matter of money, or he may have wanted to see what he could accomplish with non-Hollywood performers.The hard-working Mr. Tatum is scarcely non-Hollywood. In his carefully strategized career he has gone quickly from music-video anonymity and background brooding to serving as a co-star and now lead in bigger and bigger mainstream fare. (There’s also been the de rigueur host gig on “Saturday Night Live.”) He’s pretty, if not impossibly so, with the looks of the heartthrob next door and the wrestler’s neck, jug-handle ears and smiles that help bring him down to earth. Unlike, say, Matt Damon, though, Mr. Tatum hasn’t yet played smart on screen. He conveys earnestness to the point of goofiness, an air of unworldliness bordering on unintelligence that was comically exploited in the buddy comedy “21 Jump Street.” He doesn’t seem like an obvious fit with Mr. Soderbergh.“Magic Mike” sounds like a Soderberghian experiment and maybe it is, though not on a conspicuous level. Save for a luridly colored bacchanal, an entertaining attempt at drug-fueled, sex-spiked Expressionism, the movie has little of the formal experimentation that sometimes characterizes Mr. Soderbergh’s feature-film work. Yet the collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movie’s misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum’s heat and charm — and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike’s — with Mr. Soderbergh’s cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.Like some of Mr. Soderbergh’s other movies, including “The Girlfriend Experience,” about a New York prostitute,“Magic Mike” is also very much an inquiry into capitalism and its woes, which means that, like them, it’s also about movies. At one point Mike puts on a suit and glasses and tries to secure a bank loan. Mr. Soderbergh plays up the comedy between the stripper and flustered female banker (Betsy Brandt), who says she really, really wants to give him what he wants but can’t. Mike yearns to make his artisan furniture. The world, though, wants him to strip and shake his tail. That may not be the subtlest metaphor for the independent filmmaker struggling against the Hollywood machine, but like the rest of this movie, it works — beautifully.“Magic Mike” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Published in 1936 with the Spanish Civil War on the horizon, the book, interpreted as pacifist propaganda, found enemies on both sides.“Ferdinand,” the new computer-animated adaptation from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies), speaks to its own time in a different way, dutifully adhering to the template for contemporary children’s films while avoiding much personality or distinction. The be-yourself messaging is easy to comprehend. A growing-up montage is set to an original Nick Jonas song that sounds like ideal music to get put on hold to. The farm animals represent a cross-section of nations, from a Scottish Highland bull (voiced by David Tennant) to German horses. And the movie is bright and peppy enough to hold young viewers’ attention, though a faithful 1938 Walt Disney short showed more inventiveness in eight minutes.The expanded adventures of Ferdinand (John Cena as an adult) find him encountering new friends, including a misfit goat (Kate McKinnon, whose freewheeling comedy style doesn’t register in the cartoon format) and three hedgehogs (Gina Rodriguez, Daveed Diggs and Gabriel Iglesias). He buries the hatchet with the bulls who bullied him as a child. For some reason, Peyton Manning lends his voice to the one who always has an upset stomach.Unlike in the book, Ferdinand earns the arena’s cheers for not fighting, but the crowd’s sense of surprise will elude audiences attending “Ferdinand.”",0,70466891.0,53546717.0,1

Young teenage boys who still play with Transformer toys (or keep them under the bed).2. Older teenage boys who identify with the professional  doofus Shia LaBeouf.3. Somewhat older teenage boys who would like to play with the professional hottie Megan Fox.4. Boys of all ages who think it would be cool to go to war and run around the desert shooting guns.Of course, viewers can embrace several categories at once; say, those who collect toys and liked Mr. LaBeouf in the last “Indiana Jones” movie. Or those who fantasize about having sex with Ms. Fox while shooting guns, a vision that distills the auteurist ambitions and popular appeal of the movie’s director, Michael Bay.And make no mistake: Mr. Bay is an auteur. His signature adorns every image in his movies, as conspicuously as that of Lars von Trier, and every single one is inscribed with a specific worldview and moral sensibility. Mr. Bay’s subject — overwhelming violent conquest — is as blatant and consistent as his cluttered mise-en-scène. His images, particularly during the frequent action sequences, can be difficult to visually track, but they are also consistently disjointed. (And proudly self-referential: the only director he overtly cites is himself, with a shot of the poster for his movie “Bad Boys II.”) The French filmmaker Jacques Rivette once described an auteur as someone who speaks in the first person. Mr. Bay prefers to shout.The shouting here commences just as Sam Witwicky (Mr. LaBeouf) heads off to college having ridden shotgun on a battle royal between extraterrestrials in the first flick. While fighting over the fate of the planet, the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons hang out on Earth disguised as machines with cute nicknames, mostly fast cars, big rigs and military planes. The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), usually rolls as a Peterbilt truck tricked out with shiny chrome and red painted flames, while the car parked in Sam’s family garage, a screaming if now voiceless yellow 2010 Camaro, goes by Bumblebee. Every so often, the aliens convert to their true shapes, their articulated parts opening up like metallic origami.Given Mr. Bay’s predilection for action over introspection, it’s no surprise that he plucks Sam out of school right after he cracks his first textbook. Along with his unlikely girlfriend, Mikaela (Ms. Fox), Sam heads off to an adventure that reunites him with many of the first movie’s characters, including an embarrassing John Turturro as Simmons, who provides some wincingly unfunny comic relief, and some military beefcake in the hardbody forms of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. Also back, if not for long, are the Autobots Ratchet (a Hummer H2) and Ironhide (a GMC TopKick pickup), which have suffered a fate more terminal, at least to the brand, than any meted out by the Decepticons: General Motors has sold Hummer and discontinued the TopKick.There’s a serious disconnect in the movie between the image of power that those GM brands are meant to convey and the bankrupt car industry they now signify. That disconnect only deepens with the introduction of two new Autobot characters, the illiterate, bickering twins Skids (Tom Kenny) and Mudflap (Reno Wilson), both of which take the shape of Chevrolet concept cars. The characters have been given conspicuously cartoonish, so-called black voices that indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas. For what it’s worth, the script, by Ehren Kruger, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, also includes a crack about Simmons, who’s coded as Jewish, and his “pubic-fro head.”You’re not meant to take that seriously, of course, just like there’s nothing to the reference to President Obama being whisked out of danger instead of standing tall like Optimus Prime and the rest of the robotic heroes. But that’s the perverse genius of Michael Bay. Despite the tediousness of his stories and inanity of his visual ideas, he always manages to keep you laughing and shaking your head in disbelief at the outlandishness of his cinematic spectacles, with their orange explosions, armament fetishism and even their noxious stereotypes. The man just wears you out and wears you down, so much so that it’s easy to pretend that you’re not ingesting 2 hours and 30 minutes of warmongering along with all that dumb fun.“Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The movie is “Mad Women,” and this time Mr. Lipsky, who wrote and directed, throws in a political side plot that gives these sometimes satirical proceedings a skewed topicality.The film looks at the Smith family, which, like the families in Mr. Lipsky’s other movies (“Flannel Pajamas,” “Molly’s Theory of Relativity,” “Twelve Thirty”), has a lot of bottled-up emotions and pushes the boundaries of morality in one way or another.Harper (Christina Starbuck) is running for mayor of a small New York town. We hear her platform in flashbacks to her candidacy announcement, and if she calls to mind Hillary Rodham Clinton at first, by the speech’s end she is well left of Bernie Sanders. Harper has some personal issues to manage along with her politics. There’s the statutory rape case against her husband (Reed Birney, a Lipsky regular). Also, there’s her cancer.Despite all that is going on with Harper, the movie’s real focus is her daughter Nevada (Kelsey Lynn Stokes), who is supportive of her mother’s emotional needs in the extreme. That leaves her with a lot to explain to Otto (Eli Percy), her new romantic interest.Mr. Lipsky is skilled at creating taboo-busting characters and letting them reveal themselves in the kinds of long, detailed scenes actors love. (Here, Mr. Birney and Ms. Starbuck are especially good.) He’s less skilled at bringing his brash strands together into a succinct package. This film overstays its welcome and has pacing problems. But its eclectic characters certainly linger.",0,,,1

SCOTT,"Review: In ‘The Reagan Show,’ No Grenada but Lots of the Arms Race","For anyone (like this critic) who came of age in the 1980s, “The Reagan Show” will be like a quick trip through a time warp. It all seems so long ago, and yet it also feels as if it were happening right now. The television journalists with their trench coats and stentorian inflections. The president on horseback. “Evil Empire.” “Trust, but verify.” “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”But for viewers seeking either to refresh their memories of, or to learn something new about, the 40th president, this documentary, directed by Sierra Pettengill and Pacho Velez and made up of ’80s-vintage archival video, will prove puzzling and unsatisfying. It dwells, as people often did back then, on the remarkable fact that Reagan had been an actor in Hollywood, but it does not chronicle the path that took him from the movies to the California governor’s mansion on his way to the White House.Nor does it deal with his campaigns, or with his role in the ideological transformation of American politics. Domestic policy is all but invisible. There is nothing about tax cuts, supply-side economics, the air traffic controllers’ strike, AIDS or the Supreme Court. No Grenada, no El Salvador, no Lebanon. The Iran-contra scandal gets a bit of attention, but only as a sidebar to the film’s main preoccupation, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.That is a great and consequential story, of course, and focusing on it saves “The Reagan Show” from triviality. The improbable diplomatic bromance between Reagan, an unbending anti-Communist, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the reform-minded general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, yielded many memorable moments on the public stage. Their negotiation of an arms treaty also provides a rare and encouraging example of successful peacemaking between rival countries. While thin on strategic or historical analysis, the film does provide a glimpse at the characters of the two leaders.Reagan himself, though, remains something of a cipher. What you see in these videos, many of them recorded as part of a novel administration initiative called “White House TV,” is mostly what you might remember or expect. The president seems like an affable, charming man, at once comfortable in his own skin and oddly detached from his surroundings, with a ready supply of quips, quotations and anecdotes to defuse whatever tension or discomfort might be hovering in the air. If you were predisposed to hate him, you might be surprised to feel a twinge of affection. If you already admired him, you may want a more robust hagiography.But, in any case, you will have to go elsewhere to assess the consequences of his style of leadership, and of the movement he helped bring to power. There are many fine books, of course, and a brilliant essay by Joan Didion. The rhetorical questions posed by earnest talking heads of the era have been rendered moot by history, but Reagan’s legacy remains a live and contentious issue. His name is still routinely invoked, on the left and the right, with reverence and rage. “The Reagan Show” helps attach a face to the name, but it doesn’t accomplish much more than that.",0,,,1
435,2016-10-28,Gimme Danger,"Iggy Pop, Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton, James Williamson",USA,Jim Jarmusch,"Documentary, Music",English,72.0,108.0,Jim Jarmusch,2016,7.2,3590.0,94.0,2017-11-02 04:18:25,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"Review: Iggy Pop Bares All, and Nothing, in ‘Gimme Danger’","Considering the frenzied psychedelic circus it might have been, “Gimme Danger,” Jim Jarmusch’s reverent documentary portrait of Iggy Pop, one of rock’s ultimate daredevil provocateurs, is downright prim. There are casual confessions of self-destructive, out-of-control behavior by Iggy Pop and his band, the Stooges. But you don’t see it. You only hear about it, and it’s glossed over as yesterday’s bad-boy antics.The film includes no retrospective scenes of indiscriminate drinking and drug taking, rampant sexual behavior or fights among bandmates. Iggy Pop is not shown vomiting onstage or rolling around on broken glass, both of which he was known to do. Not a groupie is to be seen. His current wife — his third — is mentioned but not introduced. Which is strange for a film about rock music’s closest equivalent to Dionysus. For the film’s intents and purposes, Iggy Pop hasn’t had a personal life outside of rock ’n’ roll.Perhaps the director, who calls the Stooges “the greatest rock ’n’ roll band ever,” worried that hair-raising tales of past excesses would undermine this exercise in canonization. “Gimme Danger” also inexplicably leaves out Iggy Pop’s solo career, when he released the great albums “The Idiot” and “Lust for Life.” That said, “Gimme Danger” is still plenty entertaining and includes many moments of foaming-at-the-mouth musical fury.The spine of the documentary is an in-depth interview with Iggy Pop, 69, who tells his story in a deep, almost feral growl. Occasionally, his face lights up with a demonic grin, and you glimpse the soul of a proudly unrepentant wild man, who even more than Frank Sinatra, did it “his way” and lived to tell the tale.But between those tantalizing flashes of the anarchic hell raiser, he comes across as a smart, articulate chronicler of his own history and a musician fully aware of his influences and proud of his place in the annals of rock. Other members of the Stooges are interviewed separately and offer little of interest. The most informative is James Williamson, who left the band in the early 1980s and became a successful electronics engineer. He returned after the death of the guitarist Ron Asheton in 2009.In performance footage, Iggy Pop is a live wire. Cadaverous and sinewy, with dyed blond hair, burning blue eyes and a chiseled torso, he is an extraordinary specimen. His look, he says, was partly inspired by Hollywood pharaohs like Yul Brynner in “The Ten Commandments.”For those who imagine that feverishly working out and losing enough weight can preserve a perfectly toned body at any age, images of Iggy Pop, over 60 and performing shirtless, reveal that there is no forestalling the ravages of time. At a certain point, the flesh starts hanging off the bone, no matter how skeletal the frame.Iggy Pop, born James Newell Osterberg Jr., recalls growing up in a trailer home outside of Ann Arbor, Mich., with amazingly supportive parents. It was Soupy Sales, an early television idol, who instructed his audience to limit their letters to 25 words or less, and it’s advice that Iggy Pop took to heart when he began writing songs. While working in a record store, he discovered the avant-garde music of Harry Partch and other experimental composers. When he was briefly managed by Tony DeFries, David Bowie’s manager, he turned down the opportunity to star on Broadway in “Peter Pan.”“Gimme Danger” is handsomely designed and embellished with stop-motion animation depicting scenes from Iggy Pop’s childhood. It makes a strong case for a man who is widely credited with being the first rock performer to dive off the stage and into the audience, as the protopunk rebel who spawned a lineage that includes the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and those who came after.The closest “Gimme Danger” comes to a Rosebud moment of revelation is Iggy Pop’s recollection of how, as a teenager, contemptuous frat boys rocked the family trailer back and forth.“Ever since,” he says, his eyes blazing, “I’ve been out to get ’em.”“Gimme Danger” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for drug content and some strong language. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes.",1,,,0
436,2014-08-15,Boyhood,"Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Elijah Smith, Lorelei Linklater",USA,Richard Linklater,Drama,"English, Spanish",100.0,165.0,Richard Linklater,2014,7.9,307565.0,97.0,2017-11-02 04:18:19,MANOHLA DARGIS,From Baby Fat to Stubble: Growing Up in Real Time,"The first shot in “Boyhood,” Richard Linklater’s tender, profound film, is of a cloudy sky. The second is of a boy staring up at that sky, one arm bent under his head, the other flung out straight on the ground. He’s a pretty child with calm eyes, a snub nose and a full mouth. It’s a face that you get to know and love because, even as this child is watching the world, you’re watching him grow. From scene to scene, you see the curve of his jaw change, notice his thickening brows and witness his slender arms opening to embrace the world and its clear and darkening skies.Filmed over 12 consecutive years, “Boyhood” centers on Mason (Ellar Coltrane), who’s 6 when the story opens and 18 when it ends. In between, he goes to school; argues with his sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater, the director’s daughter); and watches his mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette), struggle with work and men while paying the bills, moving from home to home and earning several degrees. Every so often, her ex-husband, Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke), roars into the children’s lives, initially in a 1968 GTO. It isn’t a dad car (although it does belong to one: Mr. Linklater). It is, rather, the same model of masculine cool that rumbles through “Two-Lane Blacktop,” one of Mr. Linklater’s favorite movies, and which he’s slipped into films like “Slacker” and “Dazed and Confused.”The GTO is a minor authorial marker, and probably helped keep costs down in this relatively inexpensive production. (The movie was heroically bankrolled from the start by its distributor, Jonathan Sehring of IFC Films.) More practically, it works as an expressive emblem to go along with Mason Sr.’s absences, his careless parenting, on-and-off facial hair and earnest bohemian rhapsodies. Unforgiving observers may write Mason Sr. off as a deadbeat, but, like Olivia, who sometimes lobs expletives at her unfazed children, he’s deeply loving. These aren’t movie parents with formulaic arcs and storybook solutions, but characters whose honest, raw hurt and moments of casual grace carry the shock of the real. These are people you know, maybe people like you.The realism is jolting, and so brilliantly realized and understated that it would be easy to overlook. In “Boyhood,” Mr. Linklater’s inspired idea of showing the very thing that most movies either ignore or awkwardly elide — the passage of time — is its impressive, headline-making conceit. Starting in 2002, he gathered his four lead actors each year for a three- to four-day shoot, working on the script as they went along. (The consummate anti-slacker, Mr. Linklater also shot during that period a clutch of shorts and features, including “Before Sunset,” the second in a trilogy of films with Mr. Hawke; a fictional adaptation of “Fast Food Nation”; and a weirdly touching comedy about a murderer, “Bernie.”)What emerged from those dozen years is a series of meticulously textured and structured scenes set to the rhythm of life. The structure is crucial. Mr. Linklater has long experimented with nontraditional narratives, from the baton-relay form of “Slacker,” in which he leaves one character to follow the next, to the peripatetic ramblings of his “Before” trilogy. His films are sometimes mischaracterized as having no plot, perhaps because they may seem so, when compared with aggressively incident-jammed mainstream movies. One of the fascinating things about “Boyhood” is that a lot happens — there are parties and fights, laughter and tears — but all these events take place in a distinctly quotidian register and without the usual filmmaking prodding and cues.ImageMr. Coltrane as Mason at age 9.CreditMatt Lankes/IFC FilmsInstead, the movie ebbs and flows from year to year, interspersed with temporal signposts like a Britney Spears song or a Nintendo Wii. One minute, Mason is looking quizzically at Olivia while she chats with a professor, Bill (Marco Perella); the next, he’s with his sister and Bill’s children, Mindy (Jamie Howard) and Randy (Andrew Villarreal), in the backyard the two families now share as one. Some of the transitions are imperceptible, especially when Mason is younger, and all are meaningful. Midway through, when he strips off his shirt to go swimming with his father and then asks about girls, you see the last traces of baby fat and true childhood. By the next section, Mason has shot up and slimmed down, and is now talking to girls, not just about them.For a filmmaker known for the loquaciousness of his characters, Mr. Linklater has an almost un-American rejection of overexplanation. When you first meet Mason at 6, gazing at the sky while lying on a patch of grass, he looks a touch beatific. He also looks like a little kid staring into space. Is he happy, sad or bored? And when he gazes at a dead bird, what does he think?; how does he feel? Mr. Linklater doesn’t say. Instead, he fills the frame with a close-up of Mason’s face, letting the silence and weight of death linger. Mr. Linklater’s characters can talk a blue streak, but rarely in his work, and never in “Boyhood,” do you hear the hum of his narrative design under their words. The film’s visual style is precise, unassuming to the point of seeming invisibility and in the service of the characters, with compositions that remain unfussy and uncluttered, even when the rooms are busy. When Mr. Linklater films a landscape, your eye locks not on the camerawork but on the beauty of these spaces and the people in them — the enveloping greenness of the neighborhood in which Mason first rides a bike, for instance, and the tranquillity of the watering hole that, years later, he swims in with his dad. Mr. Linklater is especially fond of showing two people walking and talking, and you learn as much about the characters’ relationships from how they inhabit space — his two-shots speak volumes — as from what they say. He’s a poet-geometrician of intimacy. It’s almost surprising that no one seems to have made a movie like “Boyhood” before. Its closest counterpart is probably the “7 Up” series, Michael Apted’s multipart documentary project that since 1964 has dropped in every seven years on the same, more or less, British women and men, beginning when they were 7. Watching seemingly carefree children thrive and fail as they age — or, more prosaically, turn into dreary, respectable citizens — can be like a knife in your heart. It can also be somewhat eerie, simply because the series compresses decades of a human life into scenes that are, by turns, seamless and jagged — an eeriness that “Boyhood” shares as 12 years of Mason’s life slips by in 165 startlingly fast minutes. We’re here today, gone tomorrow.Radical in its conceit, familiar in its everyday details, “Boyhood” exists at the juncture of classical cinema and the modern art film without being slavishly indebted to either tradition. It’s a model of cinematic realism, and its pleasures are obvious yet mysterious. Even after seeing the film three times, I haven’t fully figured out why it has maintained such a hold on me, and why I’m eager to see it again. There are many reasons to love movies, from the stories they tell, to the beautiful characters who live and die for us. And yet the story in “Boyhood” is blissfully simple: A child grows up. This, along with the modesty of its physical production — its humble rooms, quiet moments, ordinary lives — can obscure Mr. Linklater’s ambitions and the greatness of his achievement. It’s no surprise that watching actors naturally age on camera without latex and digital effects makes for mesmerizing viewing. And at first it may be hard to notice much more than the creases etching Mr. Hawke’s face, the sexy swells of Ms. Arquette’s belly and Mr. Coltrane’s growth spurts. You may see your own face in those faces, your children’s, too. This kind of identification is familiar, as is the idea that movies preserve time. André Bazin wrote that art emerged from our desire to counter the passage of time and the inevitable decay it brings. But in “Boyhood,” Mr. Linklater’s masterpiece, he both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year. He isn’t fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty. “Boyhood” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains some familiar expletives and scenes of domestic violence.",1,18859617.0,19321777.0,1
437,2015-08-14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:22,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"Review: In ‘People Places Things,’ Jemaine Clement Navigates Life as a Newly Single Dad","The fleeting pleasures of “People Places Things,” Jim Strouse’s winsome trifle of a comedy, derive almost entirely from the charm of its star, Jemaine Clement, the New Zealand-born actor best known in America as one-half of the musical comedy duo Flight of the Conchords.Mr. Clement plays Will, a married 40-year-old graphic novelist and teacher of comic book art whose college classes are perceptive, witty mini-essays on drawing and narrative (illustrated by Mr. Strouse, a faculty member at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan). The story begins at a fifth birthday party for Will’s twin daughters (Gia and Aundrea Gadsby) in his family’s Brooklyn brownstone. In the middle of the celebration, Will goes upstairs and finds his wife, Charlie (Stephanie Allynne), having sex with their friend Gary (an ill-used Michael Chernus), an Off Broadway performance artist. From its opening moments, “People Places Things” seems at odds with itself. It is realistic about New York place names yet disconnected from reality. Will, who is handsome in an appealingly scruffy way, is a faithful husband with a warm, self-deprecating sense of humor and an acute roving intelligence. Only a fool would trade him for Gary, a glum, pudgy blob. Although this cowering, monosyllabic marshmallow makes several more appearances in the film, Mr. Strouse’s screenplay doesn’t give him a single likable trait.Charlie speaks in double talk. Announcing the end of her marriage to Will, she says she loves him. “The problem is I don’t love my life,” she explains. A whiny, high-strung control freak and compulsive scold, she is such a pill that you wonder what the brokenhearted Will, who moves to Astoria, Queens, could possibly have seen in her. The story jumps ahead a year. After class one afternoon, Will is approached by Kat (Jessica Williams), a talented student who offers to introduce him to her beautiful 45-year-old mother, Diane (Regina Hall), a teacher of American literature at Columbia. When they meet, it is obvious that they are compatible. At the very moment when “People Places Things” has a chance to soar, it turns prissy, indecisive and picayune. The story meanders along with too-cute scenes of Will bonding with his daughters. Meanwhile, Charlie, now pregnant, plans to get married. As the movie fizzles, Mr. Clement’s endearing performance breathes what little life is left into a movie that, much like the insufferable Charlie, can’t make up its mind about where to go or how to get there. “People Places Things” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

It’s a giddy, touchingly resonant image of freedom — the animated girl is as liberated from shoes as from the laws of nature — one that the director Hayao Miyazaki lingers on only as long as it takes your eyes and mind to hold it close, love it deeply and immediately regret its impermanence.The girl is running parallel to an island road, her eyes wildly fixed on a small car perilously whipping around hairpin bends in a raucous storm. Her name is Ponyo (gurgled and voiced by Noah Cyrus, Miley’s younger sister) and she was once some kind of half-human, half-fish daughter of the sea. But she found a boy, the 5-year-old Sosuke (Frankie Jonas, yet another one of those brothers), or rather he found her, rescuing her by scooping her into a pail. The two were separated — as fated characters invariably are — but she’s found him. Now, as she races along the surface of huge peaking waves she has summoned up by the force of her power, Ponyo is expressing not only her bliss, but also ours.“Ponyo” is the latest masterwork  from Mr. Miyazaki, the influential Japanese animator who has advanced the art with films like “Princess Mononoke,” “Spirited Away” and “Howl’s Moving Castle.” The new film, despite the initial distractions of the recognizable voices crammed into the English-language version (a subdued Matt Damon, a fine Betty White), shares thematic and visual similarities with his earlier work, notably its emphasis on the natural world, its tumults and fragility. (As Mr. Miyazaki once put it, “All my animation and comics involve land, sea and sky — they all revolve around what happens on earth.”) But “Ponyo,” which takes some inspiration from “The Little Mermaid,” Hans Christian Andersen’s macabre fairy tale, has a narrative simplicity, or rather the clarity of a distillation.Despite the connection to Andersen’s tale, there is nothing remotely ghoulish about “Ponyo.” No blood and only a few anxious tears are spilled. Far more than Mr. Miyazaki’s other recent films, this one obviously has been  created for young viewers, who will have no trouble grasping its broad story or understanding why the characters do what they do, as when Sosuke, worried about prowling cats, places a leaf over the pail with the goldfish girl. At that point Ponyo is as big as Sosuke’s hand. With her broadly smiling, pale human face and wiggling, red fish body, she looks a little like one of the girls that the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara likes to draw, minus the scowl. She also looks a bit like a well-dressed tadpole.Like the other characters, with their clean lines and bright splashes of color, Ponyo tends to pop slightly on the screen. Although Mr. Miyazaki  eschews the deep space of 3-D animation (over his dead body, as he recently suggested), he is acutely sensitive to texture, an awareness that translates into different visual designs for individual scenes and which intensifies the emotional register of those same scenes. The softly smudged field of grass that surrounds Sosuke’s house like a blanket is striking partly because you can see the touch of the human hand in each blade. The blurred pastel quality of the grass, the softness of this green mantle, convey a feeling of comfort that in turn summons up words like warmth, home, love.Under the ocean the colors are more saturated and the lines often sharper. In this magical realm of undulating creatures and twinkling lights, Ponyo’s father, a wizard named Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), practices his mysterious art. From the prow of a submerged vessel, Fujimoto — the long tendrils of his rusty red hair waving around his head like octopus tentacles — releases potions that restore the health of the pollution-choked waters.It’s hard not to think of the wizard, particularly when he gently and very cleanly curses the human world and its harmful ways, as something of a Miyazaki self-portrait. Whatever the case, like his creator, Fujimoto can’t keep Ponyo under wraps: she springs from the sea, exploding into the world with a reckless, infectious, almost calamitous exuberance.This is nature unbound, or maybe it’s the image of childhood right before culture takes over and initiates its relentless tsk-tsking, telling us to mind our manners, shut our mouths and sit up in our seats. Smitten with Sosuke, Ponyo decides she wants to be human, a wish that involves a visit from her mother (Cate Blanchett) and almost upends the balance of the world. As in the original Andersen fairy tale, which turns on a mermaid who dies because she falls in love with a landlocked prince, humanity has its costs. Not to worry: no one dies in “Ponyo” or even coughs. Its sting is so gentle you might miss it. But when the ocean rises in this wonderful movie, each leaping wave stares out at us with a baleful eye as if in watchful and worried wait.PONYOOpens on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki; United States production directors, John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Peter Sohn; English-language screenplay by Melissa Mathison, translated from the original Japanese by Jim Hubbert; music by Joe Hisaishi; produced by Toshio Suzuki; released by Walt Disney Studios.

About to realize those fantasies is Zoinx (Susan Ziegler), one of three female aliens whose overabundance of “big feeling” is believed to be destroying their planet’s ozone layer. Bald as eggs and with gills secreted beneath their Elizabethan collars, the aliens hope to save their home by getting their hearts broken — a task at which humans are thought to excel. Who knew “The Bachelorette” was beaming into outer space?Photographed in crisp black and white by Nat Bouman, this enormously likable movie keeps sexual politics on the back burner and the universal search for connection front and center. The budget probably had trouble stretching to a box of tinfoil, but the film’s pleasures are in the details, like Jane’s casual warning to “watch out for the syringes” when she and Zoinx ponder a Coney Island swim.A clever subplot involving the odd-couple relationship of two government agents — as well as actual news footage of a 2010 U.F.O. scare in Chelsea — cements the lighthearted tone, and toilet-flushing noises exemplify the sophistication of the special effects.

When they meet on a train to Tokyo, the provincial Nana Komatsu (Aoi Miyazaki) — attired in pink-and-white innocence — is dazzled by the sultry Nana Osaki (Mika Nakashima), a struggling rock singer in brooding black leather. By accident they become roommates; by design they help each other navigate troubled romances and conflicting dreams.Stylishly directed by Kentaro Otani, “Nana” is an opposites-attract story that plays out with disarming sincerity.

GOLD,"Review: In &#8216;That Sugar Film,&#8217; a Bitter Truth","In “That Sugar Film,” Damon Gameau, an engaging Australian actor-director who has been off refined sugars for years, shifts his consumption for two months to include 40 teaspoons of sugar a day, the average Aussie’s intake. And he isn’t scarfing candy and soda: Instead, to highlight the hidden sugars in so-called healthy alternatives, he consumes products like low-fat yogurt, juice and cereal.If this sounds like Morgan Spurlock’s “Super Size Me,” in which Mr. Spurlock ingested McDonald’s menu items for a month, it should; Mr. Gameau has followed Mr. Spurlock’s playbook almost page for page. Like “Super Size Me,” Mr. Gameau keeps a team of doctors and nutritionists handy, and the health effects are alarming. Within three weeks, he starts to develop fatty liver disease, and by the end incurs early Type 2 diabetes and increased heart-disease risks.He also travels across Australia and the United States, investigating the consequences of a high-sugar diet and discussing health and business-related issues with scientists, physicians and journalists (including Michael Moss, a former reporter for The New York Times and author of “Salt Sugar Fat”). Mr. Gameau’s breezy blend of computer imagery, musical numbers, sketches and offbeat field trips makes the nutrition lessons easy to digest.The food-doc shelf is crowded with good-for-you movies, including “Fed Up,” “Fast Food Nation,” “Food Inc.” and, yes, “Super Size Me.” “That Sugar Film” is a worthy addition, entertaining while informing. Timely, too: Just last week, the Food and Drug Administration proposed requiring companies to list added sugar in their labeling.",0,,,1

What Could Be Scarier?,"A creaking, shrieking haunted-house amusement and a solid addition to the recently resurrected Hammer Films — the company where Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing once reigned — “The Woman in Black” makes the most of its old-fashioned virtues. Duded out in a period frock coat and pocket-watch chain for his first post-Potter film role, Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a British lawyer who, years after his wife, Stella (Sophie Stuckey), died in childbirth, has the haunted eyes of the eternal mourner. It’s no wonder too, given that Stella, a beauty in luminous white, periodically hovers around him, either because she’s a ghost or a figment of his enduring longing and grief.The story, based on a 1983 novel by Susan Hill and adapted by Jane Goldman (who had a hand in writing “Kick-Ass” and “The Debt”), weaves together a compendium of familiar themes. Arthur’s employer, who’s all but run out of patience with his doleful solicitor, gives him one last chance to prove his worth: he’s to travel to the remote village of Crythin Gifford to sort out the large estate of a woman who’s recently died. So Arthur parks his son with the nanny, boards a train and heads straight into the creeping mists and mysteries of an isolated hamlet where the children scatter when he approaches, and the adults have darts in their eyes if not pitchforks in hand.Something wicked does come, of course, slowly and at times with unsettling effectiveness. It seems there’s a ghost troubling the area, haunting the estate and sowing great misery, though appearances, like apparitions, can be deceiving. Bewilderingly, most of the villagers treat Arthur with unexplained hostility, glowering and slamming doors. Undaunted, he secures a sympathetic ally in a friendly local, Mr. Daily (Ciaran Hinds) — who drives a Silver Ghost Rolls-Royce, indicating, along with the clothing, that the story takes place between 1907 and the start of World War I — and a strange confederate in Mr. Daily’s dotty wife (Janet McTeer, enjoying herself). With their aid Arthur begins poking about the estate that, set high on an isolated marsh, comes with both gravestones and spooks.Schooled in the art of the quiet boo, Mr. Watkins fills the film with squeaking doors and floorboards, pools of black, long silences and an assortment of moldering toys. Less gore is more here, and what a relief. “The Woman in Black” isn’t especially scary, but it keeps you on edge, and without the usual vivisectionist imagery. Mr. Watkins doesn’t paint the screen red; he daubs it on, a restraint that serves his slow-building story and creates a nice chromatic contrast with a palette that’s heavy on white, black, dun brown and gray. Here, when a young girl chokes up a spittoon of blood, the red splattering across her creamy pale skin, the image keeps on giving.Mr. Radcliffe makes a sturdy, sympathetic center for the tale, even if the ghost of Potter past hovers in his every gesture. Despite Mr. Radcliffe’s best efforts (including the choice to go period), the lingering Potter effect is only natural given that Hogwarts was the actor’s training ground. It will take time before many of us will be able to see the actor instead of his famous character, and time for him to shake that role off too, though it helps that Mr. Radcliffe is no longer encumbered by Harry’s mop and especially his glasses. A movie actor’s eyes can be his most expressive tool, one that Mr. Radcliffe, who has a pretty blue pair framed by thick brows — the eyes suggest watery lightness while the brows convey a heavy weight — wasn’t able to make full use of as Harry.Those eyes get a workout in “The Woman in Black,” but Mr. Watkins’s smartest choice is to make use of Mr. Radcliffe’s long tenure as an action star. There isn’t much by way of dashing heroics here, but Arthur is almost continually on the move, including during a successful long and nearly wordless interlude in which he wanders through the vacated estate, its snaking hallways, locked and suddenly unlocked rooms alive with scraping, rasping and murmuring. At times Arthur looks so small engulfed in all that darkness, and so helpless, much like one of the children who haunt the story without investing it with much feeling. With Mr. Watkins’s creeping camerawork it’s Arthur who keeps the story steadily moving forward inch by inch, shiver by shiver.“The Woman in Black” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

After a brief opening montage showing the history of the Meyerses, a middle-class household in Birmingham, Ala., the movie alights on the five days before Christmas 2016. We soon learn that one of its main characters is running for Congress. Even though it’s the middle of December. This is a little distracting.The writer-director David E. Talbert showed similarly questionable craftsmanship in his 2013 film, “Baggage Claim.” “Almost Christmas,” though, eventually represents a substantial improvement; I suspect this is because he seems to have left a lot up to his appealing and talented cast. As the widowed patriarch Walter, Danny Glover shows his mastery of playing it bighearted; Gabrielle Union and Omar Epps have real charm and chemistry as former high school sweethearts thrown together for the holidays; and J. B. Smoove does his egocentric Lothario bit with customary aplomb. Mo’Nique, playing a superspirited sister-in-law, is simply magnificent, investing even tired lines like “I got vibrators older than that child” with a ferocious warmth that coaxes uninhibited laughter. She should get another Oscar for this. (It’ll never happen.)Marital infidelity, drug dependency and selling out are among the topics of the dramatic threads, and for most of the movie the comedic material outpaces the serious stuff. The most affecting subplot has Walter trying to reproduce his recently deceased wife’s sweet potato pie. It’s one of many crowd-pleasing bits in a movie that at its best seeks a warm, direct connection with its audience.“Almost Christmas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and themes.",1,41715860.0,42065185.0,0

The setting is a softly lighted bedroom in which two people are murmuring sweet, dirty nothings under a white sheet. You don’t see who they are until there’s a cut to under the sheet, bringing you close enough to Michael Fassbender and Penélope Cruz to feel like an interloper. Wrapped in a radiant intimacy, these two beauties search each other’s bodies with tender looks and caresses, her lashes fluttering at his touch. It’s as if they were adrift in “the world of light” of Mount Olympus described by Homer in “The Odyssey,” that place where “gods live their days of pleasure.” Gods fall though, few as mercilessly or memorably as those in “The Counselor,” a tale of good and evil, but because it was written by Cormac McCarthy, mostly evil. Mr. Fassbender plays the title character, a corrupt, unnamed, high-flying Texas lawyer. He moves fast, as does this film, which soon jumps from Olympus to a garage in Mexico, where men and dogs slip through shadows, then jumps north of the border where another woman rides a horse, flanked by a cheetah chasing a jack rabbit. The hare escapes in a swirl of dust, but by the end of this scene, Mr. Scott has seized your attention with a primitive, predatory vision, one red in tooth and claw.The cheetah is tame; the woman, Malkina (Cameron Diaz, scary and freaky), profoundly less so. Both live with Reiner (an excellent Javier Bardem) and a second cheetah in a lavish desert compound, a kind of a Donatella Versace delirium, with bulbous bodybuilders manning the gates and sleek rides purring in the drive.A nightclub owner, Reiner has a dangerous sideline doing business with a drug cartel with which he has negotiated a deal involving the Counselor. It hinges on a huge coke shipment that’s under way when the movie opens, putting you in the midst of an operation you have to catch up to even as the Counselor hurtles forward, hopscotching from place to place as other characters enter and exit.From all the ellipses, as well as the eccentric, mesmerizing poetry of his dialogue, Mr. McCarthy appears to have never read a screenwriting manual in his life. (That’s a compliment; this is his first produced film script.) Although there’s a fairly blunt, near-archetypal aspect to the main characters — their expensive homes, sports cars and designer clothes speak the language of money fluently — the plot remains deliberately unobvious for a long time. A truck rumbles out of a garage and somewhere else a motorcyclist breaks the speed of sound on a highway. In between, the Counselor has long conversations — filled with jokes, archaic words, odd cadences and frightening anecdotes — with both Reiner and another man, Westray (Brad Pitt), a philosophical cowboy in a white Stetson and tailored Western suit. Mr. Scott manages all these swiftly spinning parts with impeccable control and a lucid visual style. The story may be initially elusive, but there’s a clarity, solidity and stillness (the camera moves but doesn’t tremble) to his images that augment the narrative’s gravity and inexorable momentum. The beauty of the landscapes is about all that feels coherent in an often unrecognizable, unsettling world. Like the Counselor’s lover, Laura (Ms. Cruz), the natural world is a reminder of another reality beyond the brutal one the cartel, Westray and the others have made. And it’s these reminders that anchor you, if only during the progressively unnerving hour when you don’t know what is happening but do know — from the menacing talk to the grim-reaper smiles — that it will turn out badly.Nothing is spoken in “The Counselor” even as everything is said. Westray, sly as a fox, and Reiner, his face jutting into the frame like a cathedral gargoyle, share bloody tales that only make ghastly sense later. This is no country for anyone.Every so often, someone says something that puts the stakes and intensifying throb of fear into unambiguous perspective. Westray tells the Counselor that the cartel will “rip out your liver and feed it to your dog.” This isn’t a warning; it’s a statement of fact. The Counselor scarcely blinks and may smile. “My back,” he later says while driving his Bentley, “is up against the wall.” Mr. Fassbender, softening his face and speaking with the measured calm of a reasonable, thinking man, makes the Counselor seem too rational for this madness. “Have you been bad?” Laura asks him at one point. It’s a playful question asked in innocence in a world that proves almost devoid of it. It’s no surprise when the violence — cold, methodical, almost surgical and entirely thrill-free — does come; the surprise is how long it takes to arrive. This delay of the inevitable worst helps amplify the dread, your trepidation stoked by Reiner and Westray’s stories, Malkina’s dead-eyed stare, the prowling cheetahs and the rumbling truck. Mr. Scott’s seriousness isn’t always well served by the scripts he films, but in Mr. McCarthy he has found a partner with convictions about good and evil rather than canned formula. The movie’s title may make cruel sense — the Counselor is a man who himself takes no counsel — but a truer encapsulation of its worldview is “No Exit.” “The Counselor” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

When they are accidentally separated, the film attaches itself to the enterprising Marlon, whose good looks and guileless disposition grease his search for work and lodging.But Marlon’s initiation into the ranks of squatters and toilet cleaners is substantially less harrowing than his flight from Colombia, revealed in increasingly violent flashbacks framed by his obsession with the manipulative Reina. This unhealthy bond is Marlon’s curse and the movie’s backbone, and it’s a testament to the skill of the writers, Jorge Franco and Juan Rendón (adapting Mr. Franco’s novel), that their attachment remains compelling despite Reina’s long absences from the screen.Lifting the veil on the immigrant dream to reveal the frequent wretchedness beneath, Simón Brand directs with the help of an impressive supporting cast, including John Leguizamo as a squirrelly photographer and Margarita Rosa de Francisco as Reina’s alcoholic mother.

Guess what? People put in positions of authority, like prison guards, sometimes abuse that authority, and in startlingly cruel ways.Billy Crudup, playing Dr. Zimbardo, is the most recognizable name in the cast, and he does nice work portraying a man who, as the experiment spirals out of control, is torn between protecting the students and protecting his research. But it’s the young actors playing the students who really make an impression.Michael Angarano is downright terrifying as a guard who patterns his behavior after a particularly nasty character in the prison movie “Cool Hand Luke,” which had come out in 1967. The students playing prisoners adopt attitudes ranging from rebellious to meek, but none are immune to the brutal treatment of their overseers.The experiment’s methodologies and meanings have been analyzed endlessly over the years, and the film doesn’t delve deeply into these interpretations and critiques. It doesn’t need to; this stark and riveting version of events speaks for itself.“The Stanford Prison Experiment” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and intensity.",1,,10000.0,1

Expanding on their short film “Waiting for Something” — shot mere months before Lindsey’s cocaine-related death in 2010 at 29 — the filmmakers returned to the singer’s hometown, Memphis, to check in with those who remembered him best. Interspersing candid interviews with raw performance footage captured in places as diverse as delis and world tours, the film narrowly avoids straight-up hagiography. In that sense its greatest asset is Lindsey himself.Distilled from a weeklong series of confessional, often poignant conversations, Lindsey’s life story merges a typically hard-luck childhood with an atypical work ethic. Traumatic early experiences hint at the reasons behind his celebrated volatility and prolific musical output, both as a solo artist and as a member of numerous bands, but the filmmakers are as coy about connecting the psychological dots as they are about aligning his drug use with his death.Instead they cede narrative structure to their interview subjects, which may fulfill some goal of objectivity but cheats the viewer of depth or a clear point of view. The result is a frustratingly superficial look at a smart, driven and sometimes frightened young man who always felt as though he were “racing against time.”",0,,,0

As it happens, the title of this Indonesian action flick was changed because “The Raid” alone wasn’t available in the United States. That’s too bad because the apartment complex teeming with villainy in which much of the story takes place — and into which some dozen and a half Special Forces officers storm — turns out to be a massive roach motel. Characters check in, but they don’t check out. It’s no wonder that so many of the dead, who pile up quickly, register as a queasy, macabre joke.There’s no question that the Welsh director Gareth Huw Evans has his genre fundamentals down and, to judge from some scenes and setups in “The Raid,” he’s watched his share of movies by masters like Johnnie To and cult figures like Park Chan-wook. Mr. Evans doesn’t approach the imaginative and technical levels of those better-known directors, but he seems to have an ace up his sleeve with pencak silat, the explosive Indonesian martial art that’s the main draw here. Yet while pencak silat may be unfamiliar to some Western viewers, the way that Mr. Evans visually exploits it in combination with the unimaginative rest — the mousetrap setup and tight fight spaces, the bad blood and cruel deaths — soon makes the movie grindingly monotonous, a blur of thudding body blows.The story nominally centers on one of the tactical team rookies, Rama (the fast, fluid Iko Uwais), who, despite his face-and-fist screen time proves as largely incidental to the choreographed mayhem as the rest of the characters. And turmoil there is, from the moment the team breaches the building, where it’s set upon by hordes of criminals heeding the call of a murderous mastermind, Tama (Ray Sahetapy). On and on the evil floods in, springing out of apartments and doorways with firing guns, flashing blades, hammering hands and eruptions of thrusting, jabbing right-angled elbows. The standout is the suitably named Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian, one of the movie’s fight choreographers), a commanding physical presence whose hair hangs in front of his face like a shredded curtain.“The Raid: Redemption” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film provides a veritable cornucopia of death, complete with impaled, riddled, battered, broken bodies and one near-decapitation.",0,1200000.0,,0

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘Allied,’ With Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, Uncorks a Favorite Vintage","“Allied,” Robert Zemeckis’s deft and diverting World War II romantic thriller, operates a bit like “Casablanca” in reverse.It’s about how the problems in this crazy world don’t amount to a hill of beans next to the troubles of two people in love. The singing of “La Marseillaise” figures prominently and tearfully in the plot. The city of Casablanca itself functions for the lovers, played by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, much in the way that Paris does for Ilsa and Rick. It’s the scene of their first bliss, the place they’ll always have when things get complicated elsewhere.I don’t want to press the comparison too far. For one thing, there is more Alfred Hitchcock than Michael Curtiz in this movie’s DNA. For another, whereas “Casablanca” put forth a spine-stiffening anti-fascist call to arms, “Allied” offers the comforts of elegant escapism. Its moral complexities and political ambiguities are intriguing rather than troubling, its ethical and emotional agonies a diversion from rather than a reflection of our own.Which is just fine with me. There are nits to pick, of course. Mr. Pitt, playing a Canadian wing commander in the Royal Air Force, has apparently drawn inspiration from the trees in the great forests of the North. He is handsome, trim and efficient, but the same might be said of a wooden canoe, and his character’s stoical reserve often feels more like an empty space than a deep pool of untapped feeling. This changes toward the end, but the final minutes of “Allied” also provide some grounds for complaint. They are puffy and sentimental, the cinematic equivalent of a cloying dessert following an otherwise well-prepared meal.If I may pursue the culinary metaphor, and supplement it with a different comparison: “Allied,” while neither haute cuisine or haute couture, is like an expertly tailored suit or a properly cooked classic dish. It’s not so much a work of art as a triumph of craft, and therefore a reminder of the deep pleasures of old-fashioned technique and long experience.Mr. Zemeckis has made more ambitious, more dazzling films — as a dogmatic anti-Gumpian, my list of favorites would include “Back to the Future,” “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” and “Cast Away” — but this one may be the purest and most relaxed demonstration of his mastery.Like Steven Spielberg’s “Bridge of Spies,” it infuses a venerable genre and a familiar period with new interest. The first shot, of Mr. Pitt’s character, Max Vatan, parachuting into the Moroccan desert, is hypnotically beautiful and strange. Your eye keeps recalibrating the perspective, anticipating Max’s touchdown when he is still far above the ground and then blinking in surprise when he finally lands. The rest of the film produces a similar effect, teasing your expectations and concealing cards in its impeccable sleeves.Once in Casablanca, Max is introduced to Marianne Beauséjour, a French resistance fighter who is his partner on a dangerous mission. Their orders are to pretend that they are married, and they end up giving themselves wholeheartedly to the performance, and to each other. Marianne explains that part of her method is to make sure that, whatever the details of the imposture, the feeling is real. That assertion will haunt the second half of the movie, which follows the couple to London.At this point I’m reluctant — though not as reluctant as some of the trailers — to say more. “Allied” is, among other things, a marvel of structure, a perfectly bifurcated story that manages a drastic shift in tone with exquisite aplomb. Max and Marianne set up house in Hampstead; she gives birth to a daughter during an air raid; he commutes to a mostly deskbound job, and the audience is free to appreciate the work of a superb supporting cast that includes Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan and Simon McBurney.Ordinary life during wartime — a shuffle of tedium and hysteria, bureaucratic entanglement and everyday pleasures — is evoked in fine detail. Mr. Zemeckis and the screenwriter, Steven Knight, plant almost imperceptible clues that blossom into sinister and scary possibilities in a way that is both shocking and satisfying. You have an itchy premonition that something terrible is going to happen, and when it does the itch is scratched.“Standard operating procedure for intimate betrayal” is a military catchphrase that haunts “Allied,” a plausible portrait of a midcentury marriage that is also a fantastical piece of trompe-l’oeil storytelling. Ms. Cotillard, in a remarkable series of frocks, hats, coats and trouser suits, is the key to the film’s spell. Is Marianne a stylized studio-era feminine ideal, or a film noir femme fatale — or something else entirely, a modern woman decked out in Hollywood hand-me-downs?You would not mistake this for an old movie. The language is too raw, the sexuality too frank, the politics too cloudy. But you might nonetheless feel like an older kind of moviegoer while you’re watching it: an adult, for one thing, whose intelligence is respected by an intricate, thematically thorny plot even as your thirst for visceral excitement is slaked by clean and breathless action sequences. You also get to look at beautiful people in (and half out of) beautiful clothes. The fundamental things apply.“Allied” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). I’m shocked — shocked — to find swearing, sex and smoking going on in this establishment. Running time: 1 hour 56 minutes.",1,40069087.0,40098064.0,0

Directed by Tom Vaughan from a screenplay by Matthew Newman, this witless, offensively sexist farrago stars a flabby Pierce Brosnan as Richard Haig, a self-satisfied professor of English romantic poetry at Cambridge and a serial womanizer who sleeps with his students. When his latest girlfriend, Kate (Jessica Alba), an American, informs him she’s pregnant, he promptly throws up.A chip off the old block, he is following in the footsteps of his father, Gordon (Malcolm McDowell), who has an advanced case of satyriasis. A vain, bilious misanthrope, Gordon has all the charm of a troll dragged up from a sewer outlet under a bridge. After the baby is born, he sarcastically refers to him as “the little turd.”Determined to change his ways and to be a good father, Richard moves with Kate to Los Angeles, where she falls in love with Brian (Ben McKenzie), a charisma-free dullard, and complications about parenting ensue. Who should appear but Kate’s zany older sister, Olivia (Salma Hayek), whom Richard was trying to seduce the very evening Kate announced that she was pregnant? In the most excruciating moment of a 99-minute film that seems to last for three hours, Ms. Hayek imitates the grunts, groans and howls of different men in the throes of orgasm. They could just as easily be my suppressed cries of agony at having to endure one of the worst films to sport the label “romantic comedy.”“Some Kind of Beautiful” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language, sexual content, some nudity and drug use.",0,,,1

GOLD,"Review: ‘Short Skin,’ an Anatomical Sex Comedy","“Short Skin,” an Italian film directed by Duccio Chiarini, bills itself as a coming-of-age sex comedy, and the premise certainly suggests as much. As hot-blooded as any 17-year-old gangly, anxious, bookish virgin can be, Edoardo suffers from phimosis, a condition in which his foreskin is so tight that it cannot pull back over the head of his penis. Arousal is actually painful. While his friend Arturo can spend the summer chasing girls quite willing to take their libidos out for a test drive, Edoardo dare not. Yet his sensitive nature attracts the girl across the street; a new, more experienced flame; and even a kindhearted prostitute.In its publicity materials, the film invokes “American Pie,” but it’s nowhere near as buffoonish as that teenage sex farce or any other in the long history of young-lust cinema. (Nor is it as cartoonish as, say, Italian sex comedies of a certain era.) Thank heaven for small favors.Instead, the film opts for a somber if gentle tone that, given the story, is equally ill suited. Apart from the occasional shot from behind Edoardo of someone looking at his penis — a doctor, his parents, his little sister — there are few laughs. An octopus bought at a fish market for a specific exercise recalls the pie in “American Pie” (and the liver in “Portnoy’s Complaint”).As Edoardo, Matteo Creatini is an offbeat leading man: tall, thin, curly-haired, forever moping. It’s not even clear that this relentlessly morose teenager can smile until the closing scene. Mr. Chiarini should have taken the advice Arturo offers Edoardo at one point: Loosen up.",0,,,0

SCOTT,Hundred Acre Gang Is Back in Town,"It may be easiest to describe “Winnie the Pooh,” an ever so slight, entirely charming new Disney animated feature, by saying what it is not. It is not “Cars 2.”It is not very long, not very loud and not in 3-D. It has no attention-grabbing celebrity voice work, and the only pop-cultural allusions it makes are to other stories and films about Pooh and his friends. Which is not to say that the movie is obnoxiously self-referential, but rather that it is comfortable with itself and confident in its ability to amuse and beguile young viewers.The partial Americanization of Winnie the Pooh, starting in the 1960s, was one of Walt Disney’s most brazen and successful acts of appropriation. Public-domain fairy tale princesses like Snow White and Cinderella may have been easier to conquer than A. A. Milne’s beloved bear of very little brain, and the first “Pooh” featurettes — collected in “The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh” — triumphed by respecting both the look and the sensibility of the literary source. Disney’s animated landscapes evoked E. H. Shepard’s lovely illustrations with such care that the book seemed to be coming to life on screen.The new “Winnie the Pooh,” directed by Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall, makes similarly witty use of typography, sending its characters scrambling over lines of type, which serve as obstacles, means of rescue and invitations to surreal jokes that are both sophisticated and accessible to newly literate members of the audience. Like Milne’s books, the movie is partly an initiation into the delightful errancies of language, which fashions sense and nonsense out of the same materials.The story partly turns on the difficulties of English spelling and reading comprehension. Christopher Robin leaves a note that is wildly misconstrued by his stuffed-animal companions, who conjure monsters out of the fog of their own confusion. They also are in search of Eeyore’s tail, and Pooh himself, true to form, is on a perpetual quest for honey.Much silliness ensues, a few lessons are broached, and the characters now and then burst into song. These tunes are passable, but the real musical treats come early and late, via the vocals of Zooey Deschanel. The vocal performances are lively without being showy — Craig Ferguson is a particularly fine Owl — and the film as a whole is decidedly modest, seeking not to reboot or update the Hundred Acre Wood, but rather to brighten it up a bit and get it back to how it used to be.Over the years, Disney, perhaps resting on the perennial merchandising popularity of Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and the others, allowed quality control to slip. Movies like “The Tigger Movie” (2000) and “Piglet’s Big Movie” (2003) were for the most part limp, unimaginative attempts to pander to the preschool market — a tradition that continues in “The Ballad of Nessie,” a cloying, unconvincingly preachy short (with some nice background animation) that accompanies “Winnie the Pooh” in theaters. But the feature itself, like its bumbling, goodhearted hero, has a sweet, silly integrity that only grows more irresistible over the years.So it is good to see Pooh again, along with Rabbit, Owl and Eeyore (my own Milnean avatar) — and to discover a new path back into the old, classic story. “Winnie the Pooh” may not be a movie that grown-ups seek out on their own, but it may make some of them jealous of the 4-year-olds who are making the noble bear’s acquaintance for the first time.WINNIE THE POOHOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Stephen J.

SCOTT,Navigating Between Faith and Skepticism,"There is something remarkable — you might even say miraculous — about the way “Higher Ground” makes its gentle, thoughtful way across the burned-over terrain of the American culture wars. The film, directed with disarming grace and sharp intelligence by Vera Farmiga (who also stars in it), is about the conflict between skepticism and religious faith, but it does not treat that battle as an either/or, winner-take-all proposition. Movies about belief and believers frequently succumb to woozy piety or brittle contempt, but “Higher Ground” belongs, along with Robert Duvall’s “Apostle” and Michael Tolkin’s underappreciated “Rapture,” among the elect. Focused with sympathetic intensity on the ordeal of a single soul, it illuminates, as though from within, a complex spiritual struggle.Based on a 2002 memoir by Carolyn S. Briggs — originally called “This Dark World” — “Higher Ground” tells the story of Corinne Walker, played as a child by McKenzie Turner, as a teenager by Ms. Farmiga’s sister Taissa and in adulthood by the director herself. The young Corinne belongs to what appears to be a main-line Protestant congregation, where the pastor (Bill Irwin) urges the children to invite Jesus, whom he describes as a polite neighbor, into their homes.But it is only later, when she joins a tightly knit, ecstatic band of worshipers, that Christianity becomes a significant force in Corinne’s life. A bookish, freethinking adolescent, she falls in love with Ethan (Boyd Holbrook, later Joshua Leonard), who plays guitar and has a troubled, sensitive face that is almost a mirror of her own. She becomes pregnant, they marry young, and a near-catastrophe nudges them from the life of feckless young rock ’n’ rollers and literary dreamers onto the path of salvation.“Higher Ground” flashes back to Corinne’s earlier life from an opening scene of her baptism, in a sun-dappled pond surrounded by rustling trees and happy faces. Though her subsequent experiences will be marked by growing ambivalence, the joy of that moment is never entirely dispelled. Corinne is smart and capable, and while her childhood was shadowed by the unhappy marriage of her parents (John Hawkes and Donna Murphy), she is hardly a desperate pilgrim clinging to easy consolation.Nor is her church, in spite of some cultlike aspects, depicted as an outpost of repression and hypocrisy. Especially when Corinne is with her friend Annika (the amazing, earthy Dagmara Dominczyk) — who speaks in tongues to God and with easy candor about sex — she feels loved and listened to. The patriarchal ways of the pastor (Norbert Leo Butz) and his wife (Barbara Tuttle) grate on Corinne, in part because they stifle the intellectual curiosity that feeds her faith.But the secular world has its own compromises and blind spots. Corinne’s gradual move away from her circle of believers (and Ethan) is not presented as an unequivocal liberation. What faith and doubt have in common is that both are hard work, and the hard-won wisdom of “Higher Ground” is that human nature does not necessarily distinguish between saints and sinners.I don’t mean to make it sound as if the movie, which was written by Ms. Briggs and Tim Metcalfe, were preaching or making an argument. Nor does it aim for a soft middle ground of nervous tolerance. Instead, it presents the subjective facts of Corinne’s life as precisely and clearly as it can, refusing to condescend or sentimentalize anyone, and inviting you to sift through the nuances and find the answers for yourself.As you might expect, given her professional background — a breakthrough performance in “Down to the Bone,” and she nearly stole “Up in the Air” from George Clooney — Ms. Farmiga lavishes solicitous attention on her actors, virtually none of whom strike a false note. The story has one or two (like a visit from Corinne’s feckless sister, played by Nina Arianda), and there are a few fantasy sequences that feel jarring and superfluous.Ms. Farmiga’s greatest asset as a director may be her own face, a remarkably subtle and expressive instrument. Corinne is a woman of complex temperament and shifting moods, at some times searching for a simpler self, at others impatient to give voice to the full range of her thoughts and feelings. And all of the gradations of happiness, worry, fatigue, anger and mischief that she undergoes — in other words, the full range of her individuality — are at play in Ms. Farmiga’s features.“Higher Ground” ends on a daring note of irresolution. Earlier, Pastor Bill has made reference to Revelation 3:16 — “because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I shall spew you from my mouth” — a verse that seems unequivocal in its condemnation of uncertainty. And the expectations of the audience may mirror this impatience. But there is nothing tepid about Corinne’s confusion, and there is also evident passion in Ms. Farmiga’s embrace of it.“Higher Ground” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). No one is without sin.HIGHER GROUNDOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Vera Farmiga; written by Carolyn S.

O. SCOTT,"Rain, Heavy at Times","The information supplied about Noah in the Book of Genesis is scant — barely enough for a Hollywood pitch meeting, much less a feature film — but his story is among the strangest and scariest in the Hebrew Bible. At its center is what appears to be an unnerving example of divine self-doubt. Disgusted with his creation, God decides to wipe the slate clean and start again, only to relent and allow Noah, a 500-something-year-old father of three, to save his family and a boatload of animals. Many versions of the tale — including that Sunday-school and summer camp song that has been stuck in my head for decades — emphasize the happy outcome: the rainbow, the dove, the cute paired-off beasts, the repopulation of the flood-cleansed earth. But Darren Aronofsky, in his ambitious fusion of Old Testament awe with modern blockbuster spectacle, dwells on the dark and troubling implications of Noah’s experience. “Noah,” Mr. Aronofsky’s earnest, uneven, intermittently powerful film, is both a psychological case study and a parable of hubris and humility. At its best, it shares some its namesake’s ferocious conviction, and not a little of his madness.Through five features, from “Pi” to “Black Swan,” Mr. Aronofsky has refined his taste for extremity and his mastery of a queasy, feverish camera style. He specializes in intimate portraits of people whose sense of reality is coming undone, and Noah, played with rabid gloominess by Russell Crowe, is no exception. The difference between him and Mr. Aronofsky’s earlier protagonists is that Noah’s mental equilibrium is bound up with the fate of humanity, and that his actions may have a lesson to teach us.But even though the scale of this film — the size of its budget and the breadth of its themes — is larger than anything this director has attempted before, “Noah” is less an epic than a horror movie. There are some big, noisy battle scenes and some whiz-bang computer-generated images, but the dominant moods are claustrophobia and incipient panic. The most potent special effects are Mr. Crowe’s eyes and the swelling, discordant strains of Clint Mansell’s score. Once the waters have covered the earth and the ark is afloat, a clammy fear sets in, for both the audience and the members of Noah’s family: We’re stuck on a boat full of snakes, rats and insects, and Dad’s gone crazy. Noah’s instability — he walks up to the boundary that separates faith from fanaticism, and then leaps across it — is not, strictly speaking, in the source material, and I will hardly be the first or last to note that Mr. Aronofsky, who wrote the screenplay with Ari Handel, has taken some liberties with the text. For example, while the Bible does note that “there were giants in those days,” it does not specify that they were six-armed stone colossi with the voices of Nick Nolte and Frank Langella. These figures, known as watchers, are cousins of Peter Jackson’s Ents and Michael Bay’s Transformers, and part of a vividly, if not always coherently imagined, pre-diluvian reality.The earlier chapters of Genesis (the snake, the forbidden fruit) are rendered as brightly hued hallucinations, but the post-Edenic world is a blasted, desolate, shadeless landscape from which Mr. Aronofsky and his cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, have drained every warm and living color. (That is, until the CGI trees sprout from a magic seed to supply building materials for the ark.)Noah, one of the last descendants of the peaceful line of Seth, is a vegetarian and a nomad, camping out on the brown hillsides with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and their children. The family is occasionally harassed by marauders from the line of Cain, a clan that has blighted the planet with greed and industry, killing off animals and strip-mining precious minerals. Their leader is a shaggy, bellowing warlord named Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone), conveniently the object of Noah’s justified vengeance as well as of fully merited divine judgment.But Tubal-Cain is also something of a humanist, or at least a proponent of the idea that humanity, for all its cravenness and corruption, might be worth saving. He has a sly, passionate energy that the terrified, humorless Noah completely lacks, and he tempts Noah’s middle son, Ham (Logan Lerman), to betray his father. Tubal-Cain may be a brute and a deceiver, but his nemesis is, at least potentially, a genocidal lunatic. The way Noah sees it, he has been chosen not to save mankind but to ensure its annihilation.Mr. Crowe has no problem playing this kind of monster. He specializes in portraying righteousness pushed to the point of murderous, monomaniacal rage. He also benefits from the presence of gentler, more emotionally flexible performers, and here he has, in addition to Ms. Connelly (in a variation on her role as the capable, patient wife in “A Beautiful Mind”), Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins.Mr. Hopkins is gleefully hammy as Methuselah, Noah’s grandfather and the film’s resident wise wizard. Ms. Watson is Ila, a character invented as the love interest for Noah’s eldest son, Shem (the blankly pretty Douglas Booth), and as a partial answer to the “be fruitful and multiply” imperative. Ila’s presence quickens the ethical dilemma that supplies the film’s dramatic pulse, as Noah is forced to choose between obedience and love, with potentially suicidal results either way.“Noah” is occasionally clumsy, ridiculous and unconvincing, but it is almost never dull, and very little of it has the careful, by-the-numbers quality that characterizes big-studio action-fantasy entertainment. The riskiest thing about this movie is its sincerity: Mr. Aronofsky, while not exactly pious, takes the narrative and its implications seriously. He tries not only to explore what the story of the flood might mean in the present age of environmental anxiety and apocalyptic religion, but also, more radically, to imagine what it might have felt like to live in a newly created, already-ruined world, and to scan the skies for clues about what its creator might be thinking. “Noah” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). “And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and only Noah remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.”",0,101160529.0,101200044.0,0

He’s not a child at all, but somewhere in his mid-30s, which can seem light-years away for a woman who has been of a certain age for decades. So when he jostles Doris (Sally Field), she braces for the usual morning-elevator scrum. Instead, he straightens her lopsided eyeglasses. With this one small, human kindness he does something that astonishes Doris, something that doesn’t often happen to the world’s invisible women: He sees her.Not that Doris, who’s in her 60s, tries to be invisible, exactly. From her cat-eye glasses to the headscarves that make her look hastily regifted, she seems like someone yearning to be seen. But wrinkles have a way of making women disappear one crease at a time, and Doris, who’s in mourning when the movie opens, has done her part to vanish. When this kid — he turns out to be a new co-worker, John (Max Greenfield, an effortless charmer) — notices Doris, it changes everything. Doris is more than just surprised by his attention, she is also transformed. He makes her visible, most importantly to herself, a revelation that turns Doris into a woman who desires and is desired in turn. It’s a ferocious awakening.It’s also a fairly slow, gaudy bloom. Like his heroine, the director Michael Showalter eagerly oversells the goods. Right off, he throws in a lot that’s hard on the eyes and ears. There’s Doris’s dowager-dumpster wardrobe and topsy-turvy Staten Island house, along with her mutterings and facial contortions, which seem one tic away from a medical diagnosis. As he puts these messy parts into play, I kept thinking no, no, no, no. It’s all much too much (those shoes, that hair!) and together they announce that you’re in for an ingratiatingly cutesy slog about a lovable kook — except that the movie and Doris aren’t easy to love, which is partly why they work.The movie starts big and broad at the funeral for Doris’s mother, where everyone is shedding stage tears. Seated pointedly alone, Doris looks ashen enough that she wouldn’t be out of place next to Mom in the open coffin. The whole thing is as dire as the priest’s eulogy, but a few beats later, when Doris’s brother, Todd (the great character actor Stephen Root), speaks to her with unforced feeling, the movie shifts into something more complex. Mr. Showalter continues to play with comic tone and mood — he folds in some slapstick, enables the mugging and stages several cringing fantasy sequences that encourage you to laugh at Doris. It feels cruel, specifically because she isn’t an ordinary American movie protagonist: She’s an older, frumpy, lower-middle-class woman who works in a cubicle.Indirection can be a beautiful tool in comedy and so it is in “Hello, My Name Is Doris,” which uses this funny, outwardly ridiculous character to tell a simple story about a love that rarely speaks its name, including in movies: that of an older woman for a much younger man. These kinds of screen stories have always been few and far between, and it’s instructive, given the prevailing cultural horror of aging, that some of the more memorable ones turn on her-or-his pathology, whether it’s the deranged actress in “Sunset Boulevard” or the traumatized boy-man in the cult film “Harold and Maude.” Doris has issues, mostly grief and social isolation, which Ms. Field makes movingly real with a performance that reveals its truth incrementally.Less interestingly, Doris has also become a hoarder. The home that she shared with her long-term invalid mother has become — with its bric-a-brac, bounty of old shampoo bottles and stacks of magazines — a showcase for their obsessive, compulsive behavior and an overly obvious manifestation of Doris’s struggles. Mr. Showalter doesn’t hang out in the house much, but the pack-rat motif allows him and his co-writer, Laura Terruso, to pad the story with some family storming and stressing. This mostly concerns Todd and his wife, Cindy (Wendi McLendon-Covey), urging Doris to declutter and insisting that she visit a therapist (Elizabeth Reaser).Doris’s burgeoning friendship with John, meanwhile, leads her down alternately goofy and sweet avenues involving online stalking, late-night clubbing and new alliances, including with his girlfriend, Brooklyn (Beth Behrs). Doris’s female attachments, including with her best friend, Roz (Tyne Daly), are particularly appealing because — as with John’s first kindness — they’re reminders that you can tell a lot about people from how they are loved. To that end, in one funny, meaningful passage, Doris ends up at a concert with John, wearing an eye-popping yellow outfit, a look that draws compliments and attention from various young revelers, who, treating her as a kindred spirit, are understandably taken with her. Doris turns out to be an excellent mirror, including for your own chauvinism.“Hello, My Name Is Doris” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some language, none of which should shock anybody.

The patients — inmates? — go about their routines with varying degrees of lucidity, urinating in public spaces or taking their medicine in near total darkness. The outdoor hallways, which overlook a courtyard, resemble giant cages. One man, a recent addition who runs laps around the galleries unimpeded, emphasizes the point: “Might as well slaughter me now, like a chicken or a cow.”This overlong (nearly four hours) but sporadically extraordinary portrait of a forgotten corner of society may be tough going even for fans of forbidding cinema. Mr. Wang, who shot the movie in 2013, spends inordinate time acclimating viewers to the space and its inhabitants’ rituals. He seems to have favored shots in which the subjects, committed for reasons ranging from the criminal to the arguably nonexistent, ignore the camera — a strategy that raises questions about how the filmmaker was received.But just as the movie is setting itself up as a modern “Titicut Follies” — Frederick Wiseman’s classic 1967 documentary about a hospital for the criminally insane — “’Til Madness Do Us Part” begins to locate gleams of humanity amid the squalor. A longtime resident says, “In here, a man can eat and sit, sleep if he can, and no one bothers him.” Romance blossoms, and there are fireworks to ring in a new year. The visiting daughter of a new arrival permits another inmate to use her cellphone.And when a patient leaves, a friend sends him off with advice that seems like an imperative to the viewer: “Don’t forget about us.”“’Til Madness Do Us Part” is not rated.

O. SCOTT,"Spies, Spider Venom and Sex Appeal","“Who is Salt?” is the question posed, for the past month or so, on the side of just about every bus in the land. To the extent that “Salt” is a mystery, the question is apt enough. Is she — played at high velocity and with steely ferocity by Angelina Jolie — a Russian mole, a C.I.A. superassassin or a little of both? But to the much greater extent that “Salt,” directed by Phillip Noyce from a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer, is an action movie, the more salient question might be: What does Salt do?You name it. On the run from suspicious colleagues in the C.I.A. after she has been slandered or had her deep cover blown by a Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski), Salt sheds her shoes and then her underwear (so as to blind a security camera and spike the blood pressure of at least half the audience) and proceeds to assemble a rocket launcher out of office furniture and cleaning supplies. That’s just an overture, really, to a symphony of hurtling, fairly ingenious fights and escapes. Salt leaps from the roofs of moving trucks on her way out of Washington and then — once in New York — enacts vengeance, pre-emptive mayhem and self-defensive killing using spider venom, plastic explosives and stolen clothes.It all happens in such a frenzy of momentum and on-the-fly exposition that some of the more preposterous elements in the story will strike you only in retrospect, after the helicopter leaps, the elevator-shaft daredevilry and the race-the-clock flirtation with thermonuclear war. But that is as it should be. Mr. Wimmer has constructed a puzzle just complicated enough to keep you alert while Mr. Noyce, a protean Australian craftsman whose other credits include “Patriot Games” and “Rabbit-Proof Fence,” throws the pieces in the air and watches them collide, explode and crash to the ground.Evelyn Salt — a name usually reduced, because everyone is in such a hurry, to its first or final syllable — is seen, before the opening titles, being tortured in a North Korean prison, from which she is sprung by a co-worker (Liev Schreiber) and the German arachnologist (August Diehl) who will become her husband. Two years later, on their wedding anniversary, Salt leaves the apartment they share with a cute dog and some poisonous spiders, and makes her way to the corporate offices that serve as a front for her C.I.A. job. There she meets the Russian defector, who insists that Salt is really named Chernkov, that her father was a wrestler and her mother a chess prodigy, and that Salt was taken away by the K.G.B. to be trained from infancy as an undercover agent.She and her classmates were schooled in “idioms, idiosyncrasy and ideology” (a much better slogan than “Who is Salt,” by the way, though perhaps for a different movie) so they could infiltrate American society. Now, two decades after the end of the cold war, they are being activated to cause some big global trouble.Does Salt travel to New York to foment this trouble or to head it off? Since Ms. Jolie is someone you are inclined to root for, and since she throws out a few damsel-in-distress bids for empathy amid all the smackdowns and chases, it’s hard not to think of her as one of the good guys. But a lot of circumstantial evidence, like flashbacks to her childhood at the Soviet superspy Hogwarts, suggests otherwise. The movie does what it can to scramble the moral signals, but the plot twists are telegraphed even as they are camouflaged, by the casting, as well as by the writing. Mr. Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, squabbling as two C.I.A. officers chasing Salt, are skilled at suggesting potential ambiguities about their characters without distracting attention from the star.Which is scarcely possible, in any case. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in “Salt” has Ms. Jolie walking away unnoticed from the aftermath of a multi-vehicle smashup. I suspect this was meant as a joke, since her magnetism is the film’s foundation and reason for being (even though her role was originally conceived as a vehicle for Tom Cruise). She is the prime special effect, and a reminder that even in an era of technological overkill, movie stars matter.Not that “Salt” matters much. Despite an overlay of geopolitics, the movie is as loud and empty as James Newton Howard’s score, which I don’t mean entirely in a bad way. The music does what it needs to do to amplify and inflect the action, while also paying subtle sonic homage to the brassy Bond-style soundtracks of the past. And the film itself moves with speed and efficiency. Ms. Jolie’s contribution is to endow the silliness with a gravity and clarity of purpose that makes you care, for a scant hour and a half, who Salt is, what she does and where she stands. Not that she stands for much, or stays still for very long.“Salt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Rosa (Martina García), a shy housekeeper, is the kind of beauty who prompts lewd comments from street louts and improper advances from wealthy scions. This is torture for her new lover, José María (Gustavo Sánchez Parra), a tense construction worker who likes to use his fists for more than carrying bricks.When, predictably, the police come calling, José María hides inside the dusty mansion where Rosa lives and works. Fulminating in the attic like a giant, angry rat, he spies on his oblivious beloved, eavesdropping on her phone calls and conversations. Beneath him, a dysfunctional drama of curdled privilege plays out between Rosa and her employers, fueling José María’s fury and the script’s telenovela intentions.Offsetting its outlandish premise with believable performances, “Rage (Rabia)” delivers a heavy-handed metaphor for immigrant invisibility. Enrique Chediak’s skulking cinematography transforms the house into the film’s most valuable player, his camera angling around doors and peering into mold-green shadows.Sad, then, to see his work undermined by a comically sappy finale: had the curtain come down 10 minutes sooner, it would have done so with a satisfying thump instead of a soggy swish.RAGE (RABIA)Opens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Sebastián Cordero; written by Mr. Cordero, based on the novel by Sergio Bizzio; director of photography, Enrique Chediak; edited by David Gallart; music by Lucio Godoy; production design by Eugenio Caballero; costumes by Eva Arretxe; produced by Alvaro Augustín, Rodrigo Guerrero, Eneko Lizarraga, Bertha Navarro and Guillermo del Toro; released by Strand Releasing.

So Does Everybody,"The personal is political in the films of Agnès Jaoui, a sort of Gallic Woody Allen whose comedies of manners reveal a sensibility acutely attuned to the tiniest nuances of the mind games people play. Ms. Jaoui’s films may lack Mr. Allen’s comic shtick, quotable one-liners and showy metaphysical angst, but they are precisely calibrated dissections of the pretensions and insecurities of the French chattering class. As critical as she can be of her characters, Ms. Jaoui portrays them with the evenhanded sympathy of a wise therapist who likes her clients despite their annoying foibles.The low-level politicians and media types who inhabit “Let It Rain,” her third film as a director (she has acted in many others), are too busy pursuing their personal agendas to sit back and despair about the human condition. Almost all them feel victimized in one way or another. That includes the protagonist, Agathe Villanova, a self-confident feminist writer (played by Ms. Jaoui with just the right edge of impatience) making the leap into   politics.Bossy and free-spirited, Agathe, who resembles a more unguarded Katie Couric, can’t understand why her boyfriend, Antoine (Frédéric Pierrot), objects to her rules about their relationship; she won’t live with him and has no desire for children. As much as Antoine loves her, he feels like an afterthought tagging after her during the campaign. As she discovers upon entering the fray, arguing politics with friends in Paris is no preparation for the rough and tumble of the real thing.Agathe is at discreet loggerheads with her younger sister, Florence (Pascale Arbillot), who lives in the house, three hours outside of Paris, in which they grew up. Florence, who lacks Agathe’s self-esteem, is saddled with a clinging husband, Stéphane (Guillaume de Tonquedec). The sisters’ mother having recently died, Agathe returns to help settle the estate while campaigning for local office. Amid emotional tension exacerbated by Florence’s resentment of Agathe for being their mother’s favorite, their loyal Algerian housekeeper, Mimouna (Mimouna Hadji), is a calm voice of certainty. A believer in traditional family values, she looks askance at Agathe’s highhanded independence.Once Agathe returns, Mimouna’s son, Karim (Jamel Debbouze), an aspiring documentarian who works as a hotel desk clerk, proposes making a television documentary about Agathe with his underemployed former mentor, Michel (Jean-Pierre Bacri, who wrote the screenplay with Ms. Jaoui). Agathe agrees, and the project becomes a comedy of errors in which the weather (it is always raining) plays a critical role.Karim believes he has been looked down upon all his life for his ethnicity, and seethes with ambition and resentment. Michel, who is divorced with a young son, also feels discriminated against because his wife has custody of the boy. While interviewing Agathe, one of his first questions is why women usually get custody in divorce cases. As Michel repeatedly demonstrates his incompetence, Agathe is a surprisingly good sport until she becomes so angry she can barely speak.“Let It Rain” is of a piece with Ms. Jaoui’s earlier films, “The Taste of Others” and “Look at Me,” whose minutely observed characters tend to be thin-skinned, competitive egotists invested in their status in the world of ideas. The movie captures the tone of urbane discourse with an astonishing awareness of the subtexts of every nervous remark.If there is an overriding political sensibility in her films, it is an enlightened feminism that recognizes male vulnerability under a facade of braggadocio and forgives men their flaws.Late in the movie Agathe, Michel and Karim, whose project is stalled, are rescued from their disabled car and a downpour by a couple of farmers, one of whom can’t stop staring hungrily at Agathe. They have their own tale of victimization by a government that subsidizes big agriculture while overlooking small farms. You realize these peasants, who actually produce things, have a legitimate gripe, in contrast with the psychological baggage weighing down their spoiled, more well-heeled guests.Among the characters “Let It Rain” is the hardest on poor Michel, a “professional” documentarian, at least in his own mind, who dissembles when flaunting his connections and his résumé. While at work, he is so crippled by anxiety that he sabotages himself at every turn. On top of everything he is carrying on an affair with Florence.That affair is one of the film’s two extraneous subplots. In the other, Karim, who is married, flirts with an attractive headstrong co-worker, Aurelie (Florence Loiret-Caille), who is ready to jump into a relationship.Some  have complained about the dearth of high drama in Ms. Jaoui’s films. But I think its absence makes them all the more authentic. Needlessly complicated, life already has more than enough petty dramas. “Let It Rain” may not be funny in a ha-ha sense, but it gave me an amused open-mouthed appreciation of life’s absurdities, including unanticipated nuisances like bad weather.Let It RainOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Agnès Jaoui; written by Ms.Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri; director ofphotography, David Quesemand; editedby François Gedigier; production designer,Christian Marti; costumes by Eve-MarieArnault; produced by Jean-PhilippeAndraca and Christian Berard; releasedby IFC Films.

On a New England plantation, around 1630, a true believer, William (Ralph Ineson), and his family are facing a grim assemblage. The setting is a kind of meeting house crowded with men, women and children, a congregation whose silence and unsmiling faces imply disapproval or perhaps fear. Whether they’re standing in judgment doesn’t matter to William, whose arrogant faith in his own notion of Christianity is as deep and darkly unsettling as his sepulchral voice. It’s the sort of soul-and-earth-quaking voice you can imagine one of the biblical patriarchs having, the kind that Abraham used on God and Isaac alike.Written and directed by Robert Eggers, “The Witch ” takes place in an America that in its extremes feels more familiar than its period drag might suggest. It’s set a decade after the Mayflower landed in Plymouth and tracks William’s family as it leaves the plantation to settle down alone at the edge of a forest. There, the family members build a farm, grow corn and commit themselves to God, a contract tested by a series of calamities that turn this story of belief into a freak-out of doubt. As the wind stirs the trees and the children taunt one another with talk of witches, you may remember that the movie’s subtitle is “A New-England Folktale.” Something wicked this way comes?Mr. Eggers knows how to dress a room beautifully and establish a mood quickly. He has a background working on sets and costumes across the arts (his credits include “Sesame Street” and the theater group La MaMa), and the world he and his team conjure in “The Witch” is meticulous and immersive. From the start, with antiqued detail, naturalistic lighting and tightly packed bodies, he signals the claustrophobia of the plantation, where religious fanaticism meets groupthink. Within minutes William’s family is on its lonely road, an exodus that — underlined by the image of the colony gates closing — instills a tremor of anxiety. With a gentle rap-rapping, Mr. Eggers intensifies the shivers with art-film moves, genre shocks and an excellent cast that includes a progressively rowdy menagerie.At first, these creatures skitter around the edge of the story, their baaing and barking creating a homey cacophony with the giddy squeals of the family’s children. From afar the farm looks as pretty as a needlepoint sampler, with its belching chimney, stacks of corn and quaintly dressed figures. Closer up, though, the scene appears harder, tougher, and so do William and his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), a pair of Grant Wood prototypes. Their pinched and planed faces make a graphic contrast with that of their eldest daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), whose peaches-and-cream complexion looks too insinuatingly succulent for a world of such punitive austerity. Even when their corn blackens — William and Katherine prove to be terrible farmers — Thomasin remains in bloom.The story of the New England Puritans is itself a folk tale that’s been told, retold and fought over through generations of Thanksgiving school pageants, endless productions of “The Crucible” and historical revisionism. Mr. Eggers has looked elsewhere for inspiration, including period accounts like those of Cotton Mather, the Boston minister who influenced the lethal 1692 Salem Witch Trials that Arthur Miller turned into McCarthy-era theater. It wouldn’t be surprising if Mr. Eggers was also familiar with “The White Ribbon,” Michael Haneke’s 2009 film about God and patriarchy, authority and domination in Germany before World War I. There are gods and fathers in “The Witch” as well, even if this movie finally settles into a specifically American story about a catastrophe of faith.Good horror movies make fright palpable, which Mr. Eggers does with dependably spooky stuff like abrupt edits that fall as heavily as William’s ax and shifts in sound levels that fill silences with a choral caterwauling. But Mr. Eggers’s sharpest decision, what makes you and the movie jump, is that he stays inside the characters’ worlds and heads, all disastrously close quarters. These are people who fervently believe both in the Devil and in God, and for whom witches are as real as trees; it’s no wonder that their inability to tame the New World blurs with their fears. The finale is a trip, but Mr. Eggers suggests that when crops and sanity each fail it misses the point to ask if the Devil exists. Of course he does — just read Cotton Mather or talk to the scene-stealing goat called Black Phillip.“The Witch” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for toil and trouble.

It’s not that the subjects, three black seventh graders whose musical style is primarily enjoyed by white audiences, are working a gimmick. Neither are they simply naïve children in the grip of possibly greedy adults. These youngsters are sharp; they know exactly where their talent lies and what they want to do with it.What’s troubling is the film’s slow and steady exposure of a music business machine that gobbles up individuality and spits out a sellable package. Filming in 2014, Mr. Meyer records the group’s lightning ascent from performances in Times Square to viral popularity and a gig with Metallica in Montreal. A recording deal with Sony Music Entertainment materializes, as does a (mostly white, significantly older) team of consultants, marketers and stylists.Acting as buffer and advocate is the group’s then-manager, the industry veteran Alan Sacks, a grandfatherly septuagenarian who sees the trio as a “safe” entry point to hard-core music. But as we watch the boys fidget through endless meetings about branding and projecting a “likable” image, we see only frustrated kids whose music has become the least important thing in the room.No wonder Malcolm Brickhouse, the astonishingly self-aware singer and lead guitarist, is so often aggravated.“I’m not a man yet,” he tells his mother, Annette Jackson, as she encourages him to buckle down. (To the film’s detriment, only one set of parents appears onscreen.) And when one commenter claims that Sony saw not musical skill but a novelty act, Malcolm interrupts Mr. Sacks’s rebuttals. “I’m not stupid, Alan,” he says. Indeed, he is not.",0,,,1

Fielding familiar classroom stereotypes — the bully, the science geek, the strutting alien female in the skintight cat suit — this turgid schedule filler is only marginally more fun than a week’s worth of detention.Based on the young-adult novel by Pittacus Lore (who markets himself  as an extraterrestrial), the story concerns nine alien teenagers hiding out on Earth from an evil race known as the Mogadorians.

When the film opens, three are dead and the fourth, a k a John Smith (Alex Pettyfer), is on the run.Alighting in a small Ohio town with his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant, whose hotness is a sweet distraction from the general twaddle), John swiftly acquires a shutterbug girlfriend (Dianna Agron, bland as butter) and a slew of super-abilities. These tricks are soon tested by the simultaneous arrival of the Mogs and Number Six (Teresa Palmer), which prompts the director, D. J. Caruso, to start blowing stuff up and the audience to anticipate a minimum of five sequels.Sluggish and derivative, “I Am Number Four” is another elaborate puberty metaphor with superpowers substituting for testosterone: when John gets overexcited, rays of light shoot from his palms. He should be thankful it’s not hair.“I Am Number Four” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Together, this scruffy pair hope to make it to the big championship.In the Indian movie “Saala Khadoos,” the twist is that the boxer is a woman, Madhi (Ritika Singh), and that her fists, rather than more traditional female allures, are what can lift her out of the slums of Chennai.Naturally, the path isn’t smooth: In her way is a corrupt system that runs on cronyism and sexual favors. No wonder Madhi is suspicious of Adi (R. Madhavan), the coach she comes to call Master, when he spots her brawling and decides to make her a star. The director, Sudha Kongara, plays this up as a boy-meets-girl moment: Adi peeks over his Ray-Bans to take in the spectacle that is Madhi, a wild girl who needs taming.But Adi’s love is purely for the game: He sees a fighter like himself — a rebel with a temper — and takes her on. (Adi’s temper got him into trouble with the villainous head of the women’s boxing association.)Ms. Kongara seems to know the clichés of fighter movies and is mostly unembarrassed to embrace them. That keeps the film humming along, as does Mr. Madhavan, who grows in stature along with Adi.As Madhi, Ms. Singh, a newcomer, fares less well. She has a rawness that dovetails with the role, but she doesn’t know how to show us Madhi’s interior life as she goes from fishmonger to contender. That leaves the movie with a hole at its center and a question that’s never satisfactorily answered. What does Madhi really want?“Saala” has an appropriately grimy B-movie look that doesn’t try to make the city spick-and-span. Madhi’s neighborhood is convincingly poor, and Ms. Kongara’s movie voices a populist sentiment heard in other Indian sports films: It’s from these streets that a champion will rise, we’re told. And so Madhi does.“Saala Khadoos” is not rated. It is in Hindi, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.",0,76931.0,76931.0,0

O. SCOTT,Misfits Battle the Masters of War,"Bazil, the hero of Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s new film, “Micmacs,” is a mild-mannered fellow with a serious grudge. When he was a child, he lost his father, a member of the French Foreign Legion, to a land mine. Sometime later, after a stint in an orphanage, the adult Bazil (Dany Boon) is minding his own business, working the night shift at a video store and reciting Humphrey Bogart’s French-dubbed dialogue in “The Big Sleep,” when a stray bullet pierces his forehead, nearly killing him.Both disasters might be classified as accidents, but Bazil traces the mine and the bullet to rival armaments companies, whose offices sit across from each other in an industrial zone on the fringe of Paris, and whose chief executives are contrasting studies in corporate arrogance.Fenouillet (André Dussollier) is an old-fashioned haute-bourgeois stuffed shirt, whose passion is collecting the body parts of historical figures, like Marilyn Monroe’s molar. His nemesis, Marconi (Nicolas Marié), is a more modern type, with fashionable stubble on his face, an ultramodern apartment and a young son being raised mainly by a taciturn African nanny.With the help of a crew of misfit junk collectors — the Micmacs of the title — Bazil sets out to take revenge on these masters of war, pursuing a campaign of sabotage and humiliation that is at once whimsically prankish and deeply earnest.As is the movie itself, which aims for (and intermittently achieves) a ruefully comical, formally elegant humanism in the tradition of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati. The story unfolds largely through a series of carefully realized set pieces, visual jokes that produce low-key chuckles and occasional bursts of amazed laughter.“Micmacs” finds Mr. Jeunet, still best known in this country for “Amélie,” in a contemplative mood, his impish sensibility shadowed by melancholy and anger at the violent state of the world. Some of the extravagant visual eccentricity of his debut feature, “Delicatessen” (still his best and strangest film),  of which he was co-director, is echoed in the smoky streetscapes, weird mechanical gizmos and comic-grotesque human figures on display here.But his pacing is more deliberate, almost classical in its precise calibration of cause and effect. There are cellphones and online videos in his world, but it nonetheless feels charmingly anachronistic, as if the digital universe had been invaded by time travelers from a planet of pre-World War II French movies and music-hall acts. The use of soundtrack music by Max Steiner, one of the great composers of old Hollywood, underscores this out-of-time quality.Some of this spirit resides in Mr. Boon’s sorrowful, gentle face, and also in the highly idiomatic dialogue he and his co-conspirators speak. Among them are a love-struck contortionist (Julie Ferrier); a blustery ex-convict (Jean-Pierre Marielle), who narrowly escaped the guillotine way back when; and an energetic Congolese ethnographer (Omar Sy) who talks in scrambled proverbs that the English subtitles struggle to capture. Presided over by the matriarchal Mama Chow (Yolande Moreau), this little gang lives in a picturesque junkyard, building strange contraptions out of salvaged materials.Their handiwork and their natural, good-humored ingenuity  contrast with the sleek and deadly mass-produced weapons their adversaries produce. And the film’s message, at once irresistible and naïve, is that improvisation, impish craftiness and have-not solidarity can triumph over greed and cruelty.Who would wish to quarrel with such a sweet and noble sentiment? There is no question that the heart of “Micmacs” is in the right place, but the movie is also a little thin. Mr. Jeunet pushes the simplicity of his influences a bit too far in the direction of simple-mindedness, partly by allowing himself to be distracted by the clever cuteness of his own conceits. For all its moral fervor, the film roams and rambles and sometimes stalls, straining for a charm that should come effortlessly.“Micmacs” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). This is a completely preposterous rating, since the film’s mood and message could hardly be more wholesome, and its message will resonate most strongly with thoughtful 12-year-olds. The sex is fairly tame, and the violence not especially bloody.MICMACSOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet; written by Mr. Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant; director of photography, Tetsuo Nagata; edited by Hervé Schneid; music by Raphaël Beau; production designer, Aline Bonetto; costumes by Madeline Fontaine; produced by Frédéric Brillion, Gilles Legrand and Mr. Jeunet; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

466,2011-03-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:12,A. O. SCOTT,City of Angels Resists Becoming City of Aliens (the Outer-Space Type),"“Let’s figure out how we’re gonna get out of this mess,” Aaron Eckhart says with about 40 minutes to go in “Battle: Los Angeles.” An excellent idea, and the solution that presents itself is a simple one: stop talking.Until that moment the movie, directed by Jonathan Liebesman from a screenplay by Christopher Bertolini, has proceeded in the expected, large-scale combat-action movie fashion. Considered as an alien-invasion science-fiction allegory, it’s about as deep as the dimple on Mr. Eckhart’s chin, and as lean and square as his jaw. Which is fine.The City of Los Angeles has been destroyed so many times in recent years — perhaps as wishful thinking on the part of cynical movie-industry people, perhaps as superstitious inoculation against the real thing — that “Battle” feels a bit like the routine training mission its characters first think they are being called up for. But Mr. Liebesman and his technical team acquit themselves with admirable professionalism.An alien blitzkrieg, launched from the waters off the Santa Monica beaches, is rendered in what you might call panic-vision, with hysterical hand-held cameras, staccato editing and ambient dust clouds occasionally illuminated by fiery explosions.As the “Saturday Night Live” parody version of Miley Cyrus might say: pretty cool. No interesting political implications to chew over, as in “District 9,” and no truly breathtaking special effects. Just some slimy creatures with heavy firepower laying waste to the smog-bound skyline and a hearty band of Marines (with a handful of civilians and a tough-as-nails Air Force sergeant thrown in for diversity) fighting a running street battle.The dialogue is functional, the characters sketched in blunt, bold outlines. Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz (Mr. Eckhart) has just filed his retirement papers after a 20-year career that has left a bad taste in his mouth and a haunted look in his eyes. In Iraq he lost some men under his command, including one whose brother (Cory Hardrict) is now in his unit. Their nominal leader is an eager, inexperienced lieutenant (Ramon Rodriguez) with a pregnant wife. One of the men (Ne-Yo) is preparing for his wedding, a few others have what sound like Southern accents, and yet another (Gino Anthony Pesi) is from New Jersey, though this fact is withheld until a crucial moment when it can become the punch line of a joke.Which is what Sergeant Nantz says his life has become in the scene I mentioned earlier. He says a lot in that scene, and while Mr. Eckhart cannot be blamed for reciting lines he was paid to learn — and doing so with reasonable actorly conviction — it is during his long speech on the meaning of everything that’s happened so far that “Battle: Los Angeles” undertakes what certain savvy show-business types might call “the reveal.” Usually this refers to an especially salient plot point, but here it has a more specific meaning. Right then, as it lurches from Act II to Act III, “Battle: Los Angeles” reveals itself to be a lousy movie.I know. What did I expect? And also,  if it managed to be tolerable for that long, how bad can “Battle: Los Angeles” really be? Fair enough questions. The combination of thematic dumbness and technical competence is certainly better than many of the alternatives, and it may be that dumb fun in this kind of movie presents a special kind of challenge.The film has to take itself seriously enough to engage the viewer’s emotions, creating credible vicarious fear and exhilaration as the story unfolds. But there also has to be enough lightness — velocity, surprise, even humor — to fulfill the basic escapist mandate.And in those terms “Battle: Los Angeles” does not really pay off, in spite of a dedicated cast that includes Michael Peña, Bridget Moynahan and Michelle Rodriguez, doing a variation on the angry fly-girl who was one of the best things about “Avatar.”Los Angeles, meanwhile, endures this latest assault with weary, digitally enhanced dignity, almost as if its obliteration were routine. Which, if you think back on recent apoca-tainments like “Skyline,” “2012” and “Transformers,” may actually be the case — and also the biggest problem with this movie.“Battle: Los Angeles” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A major American metropolis is nearly wiped out, but its surviving residents restrain their mouths and keep their clothes on.BATTLE: LOS ANGELESOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed  by Jonathan Liebesman; written by Christopher Bertolini; director of  photography, Lukas Ettlin; edited by Christian Wagner; music by  Brian Tyler; production design by Peter Wenham; costumes by Sanja  Milkovic Hays; produced by Neal H.

But so many themes converge with so much history, as the film tries to integrate an anguished personal odyssey with two decades of events, many seen briefly on television, that 140 minutes is barely enough time.For most of those two decades the young unnamed African, who assumes the name Schlomo, lives a lie. (He is played by Moshe Agazai as a boy, Mosche Abebe as an adolescent and Sirak M. Sabahat as a young adult, and the movie’s transitions from one actor to the next are smooth.) His secret — that he is Christian and not descended from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe known as the Falasha, also called the Beta Israel — lends the movie its moral traction, as well as suspense over whether his secret will be discovered. Conceptually the film is a sequel of sorts to the director’s 1998 Holocaust fable “Train of Life,” in which Jews pose as Nazis to escape deportation.The story begins in 1985, when the boy is 9 and living with his mother in a squalid refugee camp in Sudan. In the wrenching opening scene the mother (Meskie Shibru Sivan) forces her weeping son to leave her side and join the transport of Ethiopian Jews to Israel in the secret Israeli airlift code-named Operation Moses. Under the provisions of Israel’s Law of Return, those with Jewish parents and grandparents could settle in Israel and become citizens; thousands emigrated.Too young to understand that his life is probably being saved, the boy is substituted at the last minute for Solomon, the dead son of Hana (Mimi Abonesh Kebede), a Falasha woman who agrees to take him. The enigmatic final words of his mother, “Live and become,” resonate through the rest of the film.Drilled to remember the facts of another boy’s identity, Schlomo (shortened from Solomon) is warned never to reveal his true identity, lest he be deported. It isn’t until years later that he realizes his mother’s rejection was his salvation and not a punishment. For the remainder of the film he pines for her, and a recurrent, overused image shows him gazing at the moon and talking to her.Soon after arriving in Israel, Hana dies of tuberculosis and Schlomo is adopted by a liberal French-Israeli couple, Yael (Yael Abecassis) and Yoram (Roschdy Zem), who already have two children. Although they are affectionate and supportive, Schlomo has difficulty adjusting; he refuses to eat, picks fights and tries to run way.Racism is a fact of life. The only nonwhite student in his school, Schlomo is shunned by his schoolmates, whose parents demand that he be withdrawn because he is exposing their children to exotic African diseases. Outraged at their prejudice, Yael storms into the school, throws a fit and, in the film’s most unexpected and moving gesture, publicly kisses and licks Schlomo’s face to demonstrate he is not a health threat.As a teenager Schlomo develops a crush on Sarah (Roni Hadar), a spirited girl whose father, sensing Schlomo may not be Jewish, slams the door in his face and warns that he will cut off his finger if he presses the doorbell again. But the relationship continues long distance after Schlomo leaves Israel to study medicine in Paris. And when he returns after years apart, they marry.Schlomo finds a mentor in Qes Amhra (Yitzhak Edgar), a kind-hearted Ethiopian rabbi who helps him write letters to his mother in his native language. But as he assimilates into Israeli society, mastering Hebrew, studying the Torah and having a bar mitzvah, the movie portrays him as a divided soul torn between his African roots and his assiduously cultivated Jewish identity.The movie is more successful at developing subsidiary characters like Qes, Yael and Sarah than at plumbing the depths of Schlomo’s tormented inner life. Armand Amar’s score, a wailing pastiche of Middle Eastern and Western styles, helps evoke his suffering and longing, but it is both annoyingly repetitive and, like Schlomo’s monologues to the moon, mawkish.As the movie barrels from the mid-1980s onward, its pace becomes choppy. Incendiary emotional confrontations are rushed, shortcuts taken, and the movie screeches to a halt in an overly sentimental ending that is too abrupt to elicit the buckets of tears it might have, given more preparation.Yet “Live and Become” exerts a tidal pull. It makes you feel the weight of history, of populations on the move in a restless multicultural world. It makes you reconsider cultural assimilation, a process that may seem to be complete but whose underlying conflicts may never be fully resolved.LIVE AND BECOMEOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Radu Mihaileanu; written (in Amharic, Hebrew and French, with English subtitles) by Mr. Mihaileanu and Alain-Michel Blanc; director of photography, Rémy Chevrin; edited by Ludo Troch; music by Armand Amar; art director, Eytan Levy;  produced by Denis Carot and Marie Manmonteil (Elzevir Films), Mr. Mihaileanu (Oi Oi Oi Productions), Riccardo Tozzi, Giovanni Stabilini and Marco Chimenz (Cattleya) and Dominique Janne (K2); released by Menemsha Films.

Cartoon polar bears are almost unfailingly benign and cute; real-world polar bears will swipe your head off before you can contrive an observation of how surprisingly intimidating they appear. A real-life grizzly you might be able to run from, or successfully play dead for. With a polar bear, you’d have to be really, really good at playing dead, I reckon.“Norm of the North,” an almost entirely misbegotten computer-animated film, makes a small concession to the actuality of polar bear existence by showing its titular bear hero to be a hunter, albeit an inept one, of seals. (Early in the film, a killer whale does eat a seal, but it maintains the film’s absence of gore by swallowing it whole.) Directed by Trevor Wall from a screenplay by three other mammals, “Norm” aspires to the second-rate smart-aleckyness that characterizes current DreamWorks animated fare but doesn’t even get within, um, swiping distance.Its plotline, involving Norm’s trek to New York to foil a condos-in-the-Arctic scheme, is inane even by the standards of animated funny animal comedy. Its gag set pieces run the gamut from uninspired to incoherent; Rob Schneider, voicing the title role, is energetic but bland. At various intervals, supposedly cute lemmings join Norm in a dance that he calls “the Arctic Shake.”The title character of “Norm of the North” may be a bear, but the movie is a dog. Actually, that assessment is unfair to dogs — real, anthropomorphic and metaphorical.“Norm of the North” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). “mild rude humor and action,” e.g., lemmings urinating.",0,12320716.0,17062499.0,0

O. SCOTT,Chronicling Love’s Fade to Black,"There is a song about the thin line between love and hate, but most movies pick a side and stay on it. “Blue Valentine,” a long-gestating project directed by Derek Cianfrance, examines a young couple falling in and out of love, and makes of that thin line a vast and blurry no man’s land. Speaking of music, Leonard Cohen has a song about being danced to the end of love, but Mr. Cianfrance’s characters, Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams), stumble and crawl in that direction, having forgotten the nimble, playful steps they once knew.Mr. Cianfrance, who wrote the screenplay with Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne, begins close to the bitter finale of Cindy and Dean’s relationship, skips back to the winsome beginning, and toggles back and forth between those points, leaving the middle to the audience’s imagination.When we first see them, this still-young couple is at the start of another day of weary struggle. Dean is a house painter, Cindy is a nurse, and they share their modest house in Pennsylvania with their 6-year-old daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka), and a dog whose disappearance is a harbinger of things to come.But as one narrative strand unravels, another knits together. Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling, so puffy and tired at first glance, reappear in the blink of an eye as younger, trimmer and more energetic versions of themselves. Six years have been rolled back — the actors had barely a month to accomplish their startling physical transformations — and Dean, working for a Brooklyn moving company, is courting Cindy, whom he first encounters at the assisted-living residence where she visits her beloved grandmother. She has a jerk for a boyfriend (Mike Vogel), another one for a father (John Doman), and a steadfast determination to finish college and go on to medical school.Dean, with no visible roots or connections, has dreamier, more romantic ambitions. He wants to love a woman the way guys say they do in those great old songs: suddenly, completely and forever.In the early days, Dean’s willingness to do anything for Cindy strikes her, and us, as charming and brave. He will play the ukulele on a dark street, endure a dinner-table third degree and a savage beating, save what money he can, and commit to a future of accidental but nonetheless devoted fatherhood. But the very qualities that seemed so appealing to Cindy at first are nearly intolerable six years later. She wants him to do something with his life, to show some drive or initiative, but all he wants is to be with her and Frankie. He once looked like the nicest guy she had ever met, and now he seems like the weakest.He also drinks and whines, while she works herself to exhaustion and rarely smiles. The sexual spark that he tries to recapture with a night away at a cheesy “fantasy” resort motel has turned soggy. What went wrong?In suggesting an answer to this question, Mr. Cianfrance supplies both too much information and too little. Mr. Gosling is convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version, but in any case it is hard to intuit what connects one to the other. The drinking and the violent temper he displays in one overwrought climactic scene seem to come from nowhere, to be willed into being by the director’s narrative conceit rather than arising organically from the character’s life.Ms. Williams is, as ever, heartbreakingly precise in every scene, but if Mr. Gosling’s character is burdened with too little story, hers is saddled with too much. Mr. Cianfrance is capable of drawing nuances of feeling from his actors, but he does not trust the story enough to let it move according to any internal emotional logic. Instead, a lot of pretty obvious and not always convincing stuff needs to happen. Cindy’s boyfriend and father need to be made into caricatures of male insensitivity, and narrative bombs need to be carefully lighted and detonated, as if ordinary love were not explosive enough.Viewed from a certain, admittedly uncharitable, angle, “Blue Valentine” looks like a grim, dirty-realist, festival-circuit version of (and sequel to) “Knocked Up.” Like “Biutiful,” another unsparingly harsh movie that opens on Wednesday, it has a naturalism that is almost entirely a matter of visual texture and social milieu. The grainy, washed-out colors of the breakup phase, which contrast with the somewhat brighter palette of the courtship sections, create an illusion of immediacy and rawness that is underlined by the scruffy Keystone State locations. And Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling are exemplars of New Method sincerity, able to be fully and achingly present every moment on screen together.But Cindy and Dean remain, for all their sustained agony and flickering joy, something less than completely realized human beings. Mr. Cianfrance’s ingenious chronological gimmick, coupled with his anxious, clumsy plotting, leaves them without enough oxygen to burst into breathing, loving life. A recent German film called “Everyone Else,” directed by Maren Ade (and released in the United States this year), shows, with minimal embellishment and absolute honesty, how potentially fatal fissures begin to develop within a young couple’s relationship. “Blue Valentine” mystifies the emotional logic that Ms. Ade presents with bracing clarity and leaves its audience, along with poor Cindy and Dean, in a muddle of hurt feelings and vague disappointments.“Blue Valentine” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing, smoking and sex — some hot, some sad.BLUE VALENTINEOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Directed by Derek Cianfrance; written by Mr. Cianfrance, Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne; director of photography, Andrij Parekh; edited by Jim Helton and Ron Patane; music by Grizzly Bear; production design by Inbal Weinberg; costumes by Erin Benach; produced by Jamie Patricof, Lynette Howell and Alex Orlovsky; released by the Weinstein Company.

Connecting corporate greed and rural poverty, he introduces us to Oliver (Stephen Dorff), a cocky American hedge-fund manager. Oliver’s job is to purchase debt, in the form of bonds, that the Peruvian government owes to struggling landowners — a task being stymied by a hardheaded mountain farmer (Amiel Cayo) and a wily businessman (Carlos Bardem) with plans of his own.While Oliver is slowly brought face to face with the brutal consequences of his ambition, María (the magnificent Elsa Olivero), a weary nurse, desperately tries to secure treatment for her ailing mother. Around her, social services crumble and her options become ever more shady; yet the character, thanks to Ms. Olivero’s gentle authenticity, never seems merely the victim of trickle-down economic pain. Softly photographed by Bjorn Stale Bratberg, who brings equal care to the film’s pristine Andean locations, María’s placid exterior hides a resolve as steely as that of any financier.Slow and sincere, “The Debt” bites off more plot than it can dramatically chew, its characters — especially the go-between played by the excellent Argentine actor Alberto Ammann — diluted by political maneuvering. Still, Mr. Elliott remains hopeful, suggesting that good people might be driven to do bad things, but that inherent decency can win out. Sometimes.",0,31146570.0,31177548.0,1

Now comes a corrective of sorts: “The Bronze,” an Olympic-themed tale that goes way overboard in conveying that its main character is despicable.She is Hope Ann Greggory (Melissa Rauch, Bernadette of “The Big Bang Theory”), who won a bronze medal in gymnastics in 2004 and has not let anyone in her small Ohio town forget it. Unlike “Eddie,” this movie isn’t inspired by a true story, but it’s no accident that Ms. Rauch bears a passing resemblance to the disgraced Olympic skater Tonya Harding. The ruthlessness that that real-life story conjures fits Hope perfectly.Hope was spoiled rotten when she was competing and is still spoiled, terrorizing her patient father (Gary Cole). So when the town produces another gymnast with great promise, Maggie (Haley Lu Richardson), Hope doesn’t exactly encourage that younger athlete’s ambitions.Thomas Middleditch turns up doing an exaggerated, twitchier version of the awkward guy he plays on “Silicon Valley.” He’s Ben, who works at the ratty gym where Maggie trains, and eventually events conspire to force Hope into being her coach and his love interest.Hope is unrelentingly crude, spiteful, petty and loathsome. Ms. Rauch (who wrote the film with her husband, Winston Rauch) nails the portrayal admirably under Bryan Buckley’s direction. But that doesn’t mean Hope is anyone you want to spend almost two hours with, even though you can guess that the story is headed for an obligatory feel-good — or, in this case, feel-slightly-better — ending. “The Bronze” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for vulgarity of all sorts and a crass nude scene.",0,614920.0,130000.0,0

O. SCOTT,"This Girl Has a Lot of Baggage, and He Must Shoulder the Load","There are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren’t. “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” based on a series of sprightly graphic novels by Bryan Lee O’Malley, has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar.I don’t mean the streets of Toronto, where the movie is set, and which we have all seen on-screen before, usually pretending to be the streets of other cities. (“Wait, they make movies in Toronto?” says Scott Pilgrim, deadpanning one of a million quick little jokes threaded through the action.) The drab, mumbly realism with which the director Edgar Wright depicts that city is offset — subverted, enlivened, thrown into crazy do-it-yourself pop-art relief — by images and situations drawn from arcade video games.These are part of Scott’s life in the usual way. He is a 22-year-old bass guitarist who plays the game Dance Dance Revolution on a date with one girlfriend and tries to impress both her and another would-be girlfriend with arcane lore about the origins of Pac-Man. But Scott, played by Michael Cera with even less macho swagger than he showed in “Juno” and “Superbad” (he has the voice of Gumby and the muscle tone to match), is also a video game character. His post-adolescent life — rehearsing with his band, mooning over some girls and avoiding others, hanging out with his roommate, moping and napping and avoiding work — is periodically disrupted by spectacular battles with mighty foes. Their powers and his are tallied up on-screen, and he must negotiate a complex system of points, levels and lives of a kind easily recognizable to any joystick jockey.To say that “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” is the best video game movie ever may sound like absurdly faint praise, though I have high hopes for “Tron: Legacy.” Most films that try to exploit the popularity of gaming mimic the look and mood of state-of-the-art first-person games, rather than the cruder, more cartoony ones evoked here. But Mr. Wright’s deeper ingenuity (and Mr. O’Malley’s) is to collapse the distance between gamer and avatar not by throwing the player into the world of the game, but rather by bringing it to him. (If you want to reverse this process there is now a Scott Pilgrim video game.) As a result, the line between fantasy and reality is not so much blurred as erased, because the filmmakers create an entirely coherent, perpetually surprising universe that builds on Mr. O’Malley’s bold and unpretentious graphic style without slavishly duplicating it.But back to Scott, who lives in a basement room with Wallace (Kieran Culkin), a gay best friend who happily embodies the stereotype even as he smashes it to pieces. Wallace is one of several characters who observe and comment on Scott’s life while conducting their own dramas in the margins of his mock-epic struggle. Another is Scott’s sister, Stacey (Anna Kendrick), who offers him not-so-patient advice on his girl troubles, which seem to be legion. When the story begins, Scott is still bruised after being dumped, a year earlier, by Envy (Brie Larson), who has gone on to become a rock star, with a recording contract and posters of her looking fierce all over town.In her absence, Scott pursues a chaste romance with a high-school student named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), who thinks that he and his band, Sex Bob-omb, are the coolest things ever. In the case of the band, that’s almost true, since their frontman in a tormentedly unshaven Mark Webber, their drummer is an adorably scowly Alison Pill, and their caterwauling power-pop numbers were composed by Beck Hansen. So Scott may succeed in being cool by association, and he is happy enough to bask in Knives’s adoration until he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is so cool she makes wintertime Toronto seem tropical.With soft features, keen eyes and dyed hair that recall Kate Winslet in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Ms. Winstead is both the film’s designated heartthrob and its brains. The pairing of an anxious, diffident loser with a woman who is miles out of his league is beyond a cliché at this point, and making the situation seem fresh is a task that falls on Ms. Winstead as much as on Mr. Cera. And somehow they make it work, in part because Ramona never lets go of her skepticism even as she warms to Scott, and in part because Scott is never the abject weakling he often wants everyone to believe he is. His quivery diffidence contains quite a bit of guile, and what we know of his romantic history suggests a wolf in wet noodle’s clothing. (At least one young woman, a truculent barista named Julie, played by Aubrey Plaza, has his number on this score).Ramona’s romantic history, on the other hand, poses a mortal danger to Scott. One of her exes (it turns out to be Jason Schwartzman, amusingly cast as the designated older guy) has organized the others, going back to grade school, into a league, and Scott must do battle with each one in turn. The fights are as much like musical numbers as standard action sequences, and they give Mr. Wright the chance to expand the kinetic visual wit that made his earlier genre spoofs — “Shaun of the Dead” and “Hot Fuzz”— such crazy fun.There is plenty of that in “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” — fast cuts, off-kilter puns, sight gags and sound effects in such profusion that you may want to see it again as soon as its over. But underneath is a disarming sincerity and a remarkable willingness to acknowledge ambivalence, self-doubt, hurt feelings and all the other complications of youth. At the end, the movie comes home to the well-known territory of the coming-of-age story, with an account of lessons learned and conflicts resolved. But you’ll swear you’ve never seen anything like it before.“Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

473,2014-03-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:18,RACHEL SALTZ,A Pakistani Fiancé Meets the Indian Parents,"Can a Pakistani boy and an Indian girl find happiness together? That’s the serious question posed by the Bollywood comedy “Total Siyapaa.” At least it would be, if the movie, directed by E. Nivas and written by Neeraj Pandey, didn’t smother its story in uninspired high jinks. Set in London, a safe distance from South Asia, “Total Siyapaa” (“Total Chaos”) is a kind of warmed over “Meet the Parents.” Asha Singh (Yami Gautam) brings her fiancé, Aman (Ali Zafar), home to meet her family, a crew that seems more malicious than madcap. For poor Aman, the Singh apartment is a house of horrors. Instead of saying hello, Asha’s little niece throws an orange at his head. Asha’s grandpa and brother spare no opportunity to insult Pakistan and Pakistanis. Grandpa even brings out a rifle from his army days that he used, he boasts, to kill Pakistanis. What’s meant to be comic here is that the family doesn’t yet know where Aman is from. Tee-hee. In previous movies, Mr. Zafar, who really is Pakistani (and a pop star to boot), has proved himself an able Bollywood hero. Here, called upon to be straight man and gag man, romantic lead and nice-guy advertisement for Pakistani decency, he mostly looks uncomfortable. That suits his character fine but doesn’t lift the movie.And it needs a lift. The cramped first half, mostly in the Singh apartment, is crudely unfunny. (Mr. Zafar deserves hazard pay for a particularly awful scene in the bathroom.) Then the movie leaves the apartment, but it also wanders away from its themes. If Aman is gradually accepted by the Singhs (and is he?), it seems to be only because they’re so distracted by mishaps and gags. As for Aman and Asha, their romance has to be taken on faith. Whether it can survive a hostile world is a question audiences won’t spend much time puzzling over.",0,,,0
474,2010-10-22,You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger,"Gemma Jones, Pauline Collins, Anthony Hopkins, Rupert Frazer","USA, Spain",Woody Allen,"Comedy, Drama, Romance","English, Italian",51.0,98.0,Woody Allen,2010,6.3,40761.0,45.0,2017-11-02 04:18:12,A. O. SCOTT,Looking for Something When Life Signifies Nothing,"“You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger” begins with an unseen narrator — Zak Orth, sounding a lot like Woody Allen — paraphrasing Shakespeare. You may remember the quotation from high school English, about how life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The observation is attributed to the playwright himself (“Shakespeare once said”), rather than to Macbeth, whose grim experience led him to such nihilism, but never mind. In context, it amounts to a perfectly superfluous statement of the obvious. This movie, after all, is a tale told by Mr. Allen, who is very far from an idiot and who has become the American cinema’s great champion of cosmic insignificance.Not that there’s much sound and fury here, though there are a few bouts of yelling and screaming, and potentially tragic situations played with an unlikely and not unwelcome buoyancy. The metaphysical pessimism that constitutes Mr. Allen’s annual greeting-card message to the human race — just in case we needed reminding that our existence is meaningless — is served up in “Tall Dark Stranger” with a wry shrug and an amusing flurry of coincidences, reversals and semi-surprises. There are hints of farce, droplets of melodrama, a few dangling loose ends and an overall mood of sloppy, tolerant cynicism.At this point in his career — 40 features in about as many years — Mr. Allen has both mastered his craft and grown indifferent to it. Does he take any pleasure in making these movies? Does he expect the audience to take any?It’s hard to say, since he seems to make films, and we seem to watch them (at least those of us who still do), more through force of habit than because of any great inspiration or conviction. Given the nonexistence of any controlling moral order in the universe, what else can we do? And what else would we want him to do?“You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger” finds Mr. Allen back in London (the setting of “Match Point,” “Scoop” and “Cassandra’s Dream”) with some Spanish financing (as he had in “Vicky Cristina Barcelona”) and an international cast that includes, principally and in alphabetical order, Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Gemma Jones, Freida Pinto, Lucy Punch and Naomi Watts. They all hit their marks and barrel through Mr. Allen’s grammatically impeccable (and in this case mostly joke-free) dialogue, turning some of the city’s nicer real estate, gilded by Vilmos Zsigmond’s  suave cinematography, into tableaus of romantic disappointment, domestic misery and erotic longing.Mr. Brolin is Roy, a onetime doctor who, after some initial success as a novelist, is skidding toward failure. His creative blockage frustrates his wife, Sally (Ms. Watts), whose nagging only makes it worse. So do the tipsy, unannounced visits of her mother, Helena (Ms. Jones), whose money supports the couple in their book-encumbered, upper-bohemian lifestyle and who therefore feels entitled to dispense criticism and advice. She does so with special zeal once she starts visiting a psychic (Pauline Collins), who is a genteel version of the vaudeville magic acts that have long been one of Mr. Allen’s preoccupations.Another has been the restless nature of sexual desire — the male variety in particular — here embodied both by Mr. Brolin and by Mr. Hopkins, who plays Alfie, Helena’s former husband and Sally’s father. In a panic at his looming mortality, or perhaps just wondering what it’s all about, Alfie has embarked on a wild second youth with a wild second wife, a former prostitute named Charmaine (Ms. Punch), whom he has bought out with furs, jewels and a spectacular apartment.Ms. Punch’s golden-haired gold digger is an extended, unfunny dumb-blonde joke — she’d rather go to a nightclub than the theater! — and she struggles thanklessly to give the character a spark of genuine comedy and a shred of dignity. Mr. Hopkins, the silver-haired possessor of this sexual trophy, just seems weary, mumbling his lines and looking pained in creamy cashmere sweaters and awkward bedroom situations. Certainly he has the ability to pivot, in character, from aloofness to lust to jealous rage, but perhaps this time he just did not feel like it.Since Mr. Allen is a notoriously nondirective director of actors, the performances in his movies tend to be all over the map, and “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger” is more scattershot than most. Mr. Brolin, angry and sweaty, with a bad haircut and a wardrobe stolen from a graduate student’s closet sometime in the late 1970s, seems to be working much too strenuously  and Roy’s unpleasantness makes it hard to believe that Dia, Ms. Pinto’s character — a pretty neighbor whose window he peers into when she’s undressing — would fall for him.Given the way Mr. Allen scripts their flirtation, it would be hard to believe even if he were as charming and relaxed as Mr. Banderas, who plays Sally’s rich and sexy boss. Roy nonchalantly confesses his voyeurism, and Dia, rather than investing in heavy curtains or a restraining order, smiles sweetly and ends up introducing Roy to her parents.But then again, the whole message of “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger” is that believing in some kind of nonsense is a natural way of coping with the howling void that surrounds us. (That was also the moral of Mr. Allen’s previous movie, “Whatever Works,” which didn’t.) The more ridiculous manifestations of faith — notably Helena’s spiritualism, which leads her into romance with the owner of an occult bookshop — are more charming and more persuasive than the earnest pursuits of love and success that drive most of the people in this overcrowded movie. For the most part, everyone struggles through, with at best mixed success. The audience included.“You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and naughty words.Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Woody Allen; director of photography, Vilmos Zsigmond; edited by Alisa Lepselter; production designer, Jim Clay; costumes by Beatrix Aruna Pasztor; produced by Letty Aronson, Stephen Tenenbaum and Jaume Roures; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

Woven together by Jeff Malmberg — if not seamlessly, then with illuminating patience — these disparate strands honor an individual as unique as the miniature universe on which he depends.That universe, a tiny World War II-era town painstakingly constructed by Mark Hogancamp after his emergence from a beating-induced coma in 2000, fills his garden and most of his waking life. Named Marwencol and populated by meticulously costumed Barbies and G.I. Joes (including alter egos of friends and family), the town is a hotbed of sex, violence and betrayal fantasies that allow its creator to work through his physical and emotional difficulties.“I created my own therapy,” he explains, relearning motor skills and coping mechanisms when his rehabilitation benefits ran out. But it wasn’t until Mr. Hogancamp began to photograph his astonishingly lifelike tableaus that the outside world took notice, coaxing him, and the film, in a direction that neither seems completely comfortable with.As awkward as this narrative leap feels, its clumsy execution inflicts minimal damage on a story about a man poised defiantly between two realities: the one outside his front door and the one sprawling across his backyard.MARWENCOLOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed and edited by Jeff Malmberg; directors of photography, Mr. Malmberg, Tom Putnam, Matt Radecki and Kevin Walsh; music by Ash Black Bufflo; produced by Mr. Malmberg, Mr. Putnam, Mr. Radecki, Chris Shellen and Mr. Walsh; released by Cinema Guild.

Its hero, Charlie (Jonathan Gordon), a gay 27-year-old painter in graduate school, may have been raised among the Upper East Side elite, but that doesn’t keep him from agonized ambivalence when it comes to love. Even in his Manhattan of formal wear, glowing interiors, glittering nighttime streets and leisurely affluence, heartbreak rears its ugly head.Charlie has pined for his childhood friend Sebastian (Jason Ralph) for years. But the dissolute Sebastian — whose Bernie Madoff-like father has just been sent to prison for defrauding his moneyed peers out of millions — keeps Charlie at arm’s length, playing coy. When Charlie catches the eye of the worldly, slightly older Tim (Haaz Sleiman), a barroom musician and accomplished classical pianist, jealousies and long-repressed feelings emerge amid passionate hookups and tearful confrontations. Just whom will Charlie choose?The director, Joey Kuhn, making his feature debut from his own script, has created fairly credible and sympathetic characters, despite the 1-percenter milieu. The actors, especially Mr. Ralph, who could pass for a distant cousin of Dane DeHaan, are equally persuasive, though the plot’s contrivances eventually wear thin. It’s unfortunate that female characters, including Charlie’s mother (Allison Mackie) and Charlie and Sebastian’s friend Ursula (Britt Lower), compared with the men, are given short shrift. But thanks to the cinematographer Leonard D’Antoni, the locations, including Lincoln Center and the High Line, have rarely looked lovelier.",0,,,0

SCOTT,"Review: In ‘Geostorm,’ Gerard Butler (and His Stubble) Save the Planet","If I had to spend a global meteorological catastrophe with anyone, I don’t think Gerard Butler would be my first choice. But of course I don’t have a choice. Mr. Butler’s character, Jake Lawson, has a job to do, and so do I. Jake’s is to fix the space-based weather-control system he designed and built, racing against a digital clock that counts down the minutes until “geostorm.” Mine involves counting the minutes until “Geostorm” is over and then offering a comprehensive damage assessment. To quote something Jake says to a grandstanding senator (Richard Schiff) who dares to question his expertise: you’re welcome.Directed by Dean Devlin from a script he wrote with Paul Guyot and discreetly installed in theaters without advance screenings, “Geostorm” uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the president and secretary of state, while Abbie Cornish is a Secret Service agent secretly keeping company with a deputy secretary named Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who happens to be Jake’s younger brother. The siblings have their differences, but they share an unplaceable American accent, an aversion to regular shaving and a desire not to see the world destroyed by ice, fire, hail or heavy rain.The movie does what it can to replicate those elemental forces. I happened to see it in the 4DX format — a first for me — which combines the thrill of a Mad Tea Party ride with the sensory challenges of a cab ride across the Manhattan Bridge on a rainy night. Your seat rocks and rumbles during chase scenes, lists gently from side to side during zero-gravity interludes and abuses your lumbar spine when space junk starts flying. You sometimes catch a whiff of burning skyscraper, a spray of monsoon mist, a whoosh of gale-force wind and the gentle caress of Mr. Butler’s stubble on your cheek.Not that last thing, actually, but I’m sure they’re working on it. And I look forward to future 4DX adventures, or at least to installing one of those chairs in my office. I wouldn’t say the experience improved “Geostorm,” but it certainly didn’t make it any worse. As for Mr. Butler, he is no more or less credible as a renegade scientific genius than in any other role he’s attempted; consistency is his chief and perhaps his only virtue as an actor. He does his job. I do mine. The world is safe. The weather is fine.",0,33681965.0,33578782.0,0

As Ethan (Zach Galifianakis) checks out the bud, his reluctant companion, Peter (Robert Downey Jr.), waits in the living room with the dealer’s two children. Peter has been kicked off a plane and forced into a car with Ethan, and he isn’t happy. He swats away the children’s questions and mocks the girl, and her brother, who looks about 9, bounces a toy off Peter’s head in seeming retaliation. One thing leads to another, and Peter punches the boy in the stomach so hard that the child doubles over, which certainly gives the expression “belly laugh” new meaning.Of course the boy  (Jakob Ulrich) is acting, and it’s all meant to be in good, nasty fun. The director Todd Phillips, who scored big last year with “The Hangover,” isn’t saying in “Due Date” that it’s O.K. for an adult to strike a child. Mr. Phillips likes to push studio comedies to the edge of mainstream acceptability, retrofitting old ideas (here, “Planes, Trains and Automobiles”)  with new-school aggression and obscuring his social conservatism under the fig leaf of calculating comedy. But he’s too canny to make a movie in which an adult hurts any ol’ child. Rather, in “Due Date,” he tells us it is perfectly acceptable to laugh as a (much admired) movie star pretends to whale on a pesky child who ostensibly had it coming.The (faked) child abuse theme is something of a continuation of the baby-in-jeopardy stunt that Mr. Phillips pulled off, if barely, in “The Hangover,” a funnier, more intricately plotted and ambitious movie. In that comedy three amigos (including one played by Mr. Galifianakis) wake up in a wrecked Vegas suite after a collective blackout during a bachelor party and find themselves the surprised custodians of a baby. Strapped to Mr. Galifianakis’s chest like a ticking bomb, the baby is the story’s savviest touch. It’s an easy prop, good for audience sighs and gasps, but it also works like an amulet because its very presence protects the men, signifying that all vulgar and violent evidence to the contrary, they are father material.The sucker-punched boy in “Due Date,” by contrast, is the son of a hippie-ish space case (Juliette Lewis), whose profession, low-rent digs and seemingly altered state both set the scene and effectively justify Peter’s brutality. If the dealer had taken care of her child, if she didn’t sell drugs, cleaned her house and controlled her children, her son wouldn’t have been harmed. Maternal neglect sets up the joke, and a wallop from a daddy-disciplinarian, who’s every bit as ill behaved and finally uncontrolled as the child he hurts, brings the funny home. It’s an unfair fight, but that’s also part of the joke. As is the self-interest — a signature element in Mr. Phillips’s derivative, generic work — that  drives Peter’s fist into that tiny belly.In the logic of Mr. Phillips’s universe, punching a child is one more ha-ha, outrageous, liberating act that men (at least on screen) experience in the wilds before returning to the little ladies tapping their feet back home. In “Due Date” the missus (Michelle Monaghan, purely decorative), who’s married to Peter and pregnant (I didn’t notice if she was barefoot), is understandably eager for him to return for the Caesarean delivery of their first child. Like “The Hangover,” “Due Date” creates two oppositional spaces for the sexes — the giant playground  in which men run riotously amok, and the domestic sphere of waiting women — you know, kind of like “The Odyssey,” but with masturbation jokes and vomit.Regurgitation and a self-pleasuring dog define the limits of the new film’s ambitions. Most road movies have a sense of the life rushing past that the guys in “Due Date” scarcely notice, though they do stop to stock up on product placements. This narrow field of vision is mirrored in the main relationship, with Peter, an architect with a sleek wife and house, forced to suffer Ethan’s ignorance and lower-class affectations. Ethan is a rube with a perm and delusions of acting grandeur, as well as a  fount of mayhem, but as a surrogate child he has lessons to teach the expectant father. Equal parts appealing and appalling innocence, with a spark of anarchic menace, Mr. Galifianakis is good enough to make you almost forget the movie.Mr. Downey either can’t, or doesn’t, do much with Peter, who, as written by Mr. Phillips and three others, remains an off-putting, hollow man — a presumably unintentional lack of character development that represents the movie’s sole honest moment. Peter suffers a litany of abuse during his travels with Ethan, receiving the kind of physical punishment — he’s shot with a rubber bullet and survives a crash — that some movies bestow on characters in order to tenderize them for the soft finish. He’s roughed up in a test run for what lies ahead. Yet he’s as obnoxious at the end as at the start. For Mr. Phillips, a hero’s journey doesn’t mean betterment for all; it’s about giggling into the wind while riding shotgun in a world of trouble.“Due Date” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

It’s the story of a police officer, Rosa (Liliana Trujillo), who’s struggling with alcoholism and a gambling addiction while living with her daughter and grandson in Lima, Peru. Things are clearly not going well. Rosa falls into drunken stupors almost daily while watching late-night TV. Those hazy moments are among the few times she laughs. One night, after a fight with Rosa, her daughter Sheyla leaves her baby in her mother’s obviously unreliable care.The movie, messily constructed, seems more fascinated with the tragedy of these two women’s parallel struggles than it does with the characters themselves. They become walking metaphors in search of a story arc. Then there’s a deus ex machina that throws into question everything we’ve seen in the movie up to that point. It’s a radically upbeat note that’s too contrived in an otherwise desolate situation.Although “Rosa Chumbe” is Peru’s foreign language film entry for the Oscars this year, the movie doesn’t feel like it warrants that distinction. The women’s missteps seem to come straight out of a cautionary tale. And the movie’s dismal outlook even extends to the dimly-lit cinematography. It doesn’t need a miracle to see the light. It needs a full pardon.",0,,,0
481,2014-02-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:18,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"After a Bad Breakup, Anything Goes","Under its contemporary facade of buzzing cellphones and potty-mouthed insults, Bryan Poyser’s “Love & Air Sex” is a traditional romantic comedy that is desperate to please. Although the main characters, in their 20s and early 30s, communicate mostly via text message, often in sexually graphic detail, they are the same vulnerable relationship seekers they have always been but with extra mileage on their pedometers. The screenplay, written by Mr. Poyser with David DeGrow Shotwell and Steven Walters, wittily deconstructs the etiquette of texting in romantic sparring matches whose feints and parries give the movie the flavor of a French bedroom farce. The newest wrinkle in the mating game is the popularity of air sex competitions, similar to air guitar contests, in which a participant — usually a young man — comically pantomimes his sexual technique to musical accompaniment. The movie, set in Austin, Tex., the director’s hometown, portrays the city as a teeming singles market and the epicenter of air sex competitions. In its brazen bawdiness, the movie resembles “That Awkward Moment,” the loathsome new sex comedy starring Zac Efron as a smug young Lothario stalking Manhattan. But “Love & Air Sex” has a spontaneity and cheeky attitude lacking in Mr. Efron’s film, along with spirited naturalistic performances that infuse the standard rom-com formula with a zany vitality.As in many indie comedies, the dialogue in “Love & Air Sex,” Mr. Poyser’s most commercial film, appears to spew without forethought from characters who devote considerable energy to cellphone strategizing: whether or not to respond to a text, how quickly to steer the conversation toward sex, and whether to play hard to get or aggressive. In the language of Jeff (Zach Cregger), a slacker who dispenses tips on seduction to his buddies before a night on the town: “Girls guard the vagina. We have to guard the penis. You’ve got to let them know they can’t have that. People always want what they can’t have.” He advises that making wounding remarks to a potential conquest will diminish her self-esteem and make her easier to seduce, because then she will be looking for “validation.” It’s ugly, to be sure, but it’s funny, and the tough women they pursue are no slouches at brutally dishing it back. The story follows two couples whose relationships have recently dissolved. Jeff and Kara (Sara Paxton), who live in Austin, are angry, wild creatures whose postbreakup war escalates into an onstage air sex duel. Their friends Cathy (Ashley Bell) and Stan (Michael Stahl-David), who arrive from opposite coasts, are relatively decorous and sincere. When Stan discovers on Cathy’s Facebook page that she’s visiting Kara in Austin, he drops everything to jump on a plane to pursue her.Among the four, the tattooed, frequently drunk Kara is the boldest and bitterest. She is the kind of troublemaker who coaxes a date to open his trousers so she can see what’s inside and take a picture. But once the movie sheds its armor and turns comfy cozy, she reveals a heart under the brass. “Love & Air Sex” is an affectionate insider’s tour of Austin’s night life that could lure visiting hedonists to that Texas capital. Even when playing it safe and sweet, it conveys a bracing sense of adventure.",1,,,0

Although laughter is the appropriate response to this pulpy, lighthearted gorefest, its pro-Mexican, anti-American stance is so gleefully inflammatory that some incensed nativists may refuse to get the joke.Reacting to the film’s leaked screenplay, the radio talk show firebrand Alex Jones posted a YouTube video in which he warned that “Machete” could foment a “race war.” A comedy showdown with the Wayans brothers would seem more likely.“Machete,” co-directed by Mr. Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis from a script by Mr. Rodriguez and his cousin Álvaro Rodriguez, begins with a massacre involving a naked woman and many severed heads, and it keeps on slamming and banging with a gleeful, nose-thumbing insouciance.Making fun of itself as it goes along, this live-action comic book, with roots in the pungent swamp of 1970s B movies, was foreshadowed in a fake trailer Mr. Rodriguez made for “Grindhouse,” his 2007 collaboration with Quentin Tarantino. The pace is swift, the tone playful, the screenplay peppered with one-liners. Whether mowed down by gunfire or dispatched by sheaves of blades, the bodies pile up in split-second blasts of carnage.A central joke is the casting of Danny Trejo, the 66-year-old Mexican-American actor and veteran of several Rodriguez movies (including “Desperado” and “Spy Kids”) in his first lead role as the heroic title character. With his buffalo-nickel head; craggy, unsmiling face; stringy hair; and superhuman facility as a knife thrower, Mr. Trejo offers an amusing inside-out caricature of the Hollywood stereotype of a Latin American drug cartel’s sinister enforcer who speaks in growled sound bites (“Machete don’t text”).An ex-Federale, Machete has escaped to Texas after clashing with Torrez (Steven Seagal, in a rare turn as a villain), a Mexican drug kingpin who owns every politician on both sides of the border. In Torrez’s pocket is McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), a Texas senator who campaigns on a rabid anti-immigration platform and whom Mr. De Niro plays as a crinkly-eyed, hate-spewing hybrid of Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush; one campaign commercial compares illegal immigrants to cockroaches. From his smirking lips issue rhetorical bombshells that even the most fervent supporter of Arizona’s new immigration law wouldn’t dare utter in public.Hired to assassinate McLaughlin, Machete is unknowingly set up as the fall guy. During the botched attempt, Machete is wounded, and in the movie’s funniest gag, he escapes from the hospital by lowering himself on dangling intestines. Slicing, stabbing and shooting his way to glory, he ascends from day laborer to leader of an army of United States-bound Mexicans wielding garden tools.Women melt before Machete, who barely notices. Whether the task at hand is servicing a beauty or disposing of a dozen people in under five seconds, this monosyllabic, expressionless killing machine discharges it with cool, deadpan indifference.Funny throwaway jokes include the casting of Lindsay Lohan in a flashy cameo as April, a rich, scowling slut who dons a nun’s habit to wield a machine gun. She is the daughter of McLaughlin’s corrupt right-hand man, Booth (Jeff Fahey),  whose videotaped confessions to his priest include his lust for April. She and her sexy blond mother, June (Alicia Rachel Marek), divert Machete in a threesome. Cheech Marin plays Machete’s brother, Padre, a priest who is crucified in his own church.Completing the unholy trinity of rotten, greedy Americans,  along with McLaughlin and Booth, is Von (Don Johnson), a border vigilante who keeps his own army ready to slaughter any encroaching Mexican horde.The only American with a conscience, Sartana (Jessica Alba), is a hard-nosed immigration officer who switches sides. The movie’s heroine, Luz (Michelle Rodriguez, who is not related to the director), a taco stand operator known as She (pronounced Che), also runs “the network,” a secret revolutionary Mexican army waiting for the signal to rise up.For all its political button pushing, “Machete” is too preposterous to qualify as satire. The only viewers it is likely to upset are the same kind of people who once claimed that the purple Tinky Winky in “Teletubbies” promoted a gay agenda. A pop culture conspiracy is usually in the paranoid eye of the beholder.“Machete”  is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extreme gore, nudity and sexual situations.MACHETEOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis; written by Robert Rodriguez and Álvaro Rodriguez; director of photography, Jimmy Lindsey; edited by Robert Rodriguez and Rebecca Rodriguez; music by Chingon; production designer, Chris Stull;  costumes by Nina Proctor; produced by Robert Rodriguez, Elizabeth Avellán and Rick Schwartz; released by 20th Century Fox.

Rowling (novel)",2010,7.7,399729.0,78.0,2017-11-02 04:18:12,A. O. SCOTT,Time for Young Wizards to Put Away Childish Things,"The midnight bookstore parties are all in the past, and, with the opening of the first half of the film adaptation of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” an extraordinary pop-culture cycle is on the verge of completion.“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” was published in America in 1998 — a lifetime ago for many young readers, just yesterday for their parents — and that tale and its six sequels now seem like permanent fixtures of the literary landscape. Under the spell of J. K. Rowling’s prose, a great many middle-aged readers were temporarily changed into 10-year-olds. That none of the movies have demonstrated quite the same power makes it easy to underestimate their success. But in the past decade more than a few promising franchises based on popular book series have failed to turn loyal readers into enthusiastic audiences or to bring in legions of new fans. Their fate (think of “Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events” and “The Golden Compass”) suggests that the perennial appeal of “Harry Potter” on screen was hardly a foregone conclusion.So by now it is beyond doubt that “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” will attract the passionate, the curious and the nostalgic in large numbers. And they are likely to be pleased. David Yates, who directed the fifth and sixth installments in the series, has shown a knack for capturing and quickening Ms. Rowling’s storytelling rhythm. He has also demonstrated a thorough, uncondescending sympathy for her characters, in particular the central trio of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Harry himself.In this chapter their adventures have an especially somber and scary coloration, as the three friends are cast out from the protective cocoon of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry into a bleak, perilous grown-up world that tests the independence they have struggled to obtain under the not-always-benevolent eyes of their teachers. Childish things have been put away — this time there is no quidditch, no school uniforms, no schoolboy crushes or classroom pranks — and adult supervision has all but vanished. Albus Dumbledore is dead, and though Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Alastor Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) offer some assistance early on, Harry and his companions must rely on the kindness of house elves, on their own newly mastered wizarding skills and, above all, on one another.This is not always so easy. The implicit rivalry for Hermione’s favor that has always simmered between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron (Rupert Grint) bubbles to the surface, as does Ron’s resentment at being the Chosen One’s sidekick. The burden of chosenness weighs on Harry as well; it is easier for him to accept being singled out for death by Lord Voldemort than to countenance the willingness of his allies and protectors to sacrifice their lives for him. Hermione (Emma Watson), for her part, seems lonelier than ever. She has broken entirely with her Muggle parents, expunging herself from their memories to prevent them from being caught up in an increasingly vicious intrawizard civil war.For most of this film  Voldemort’s forces are very much in the ascendant. The production design is dense with visual allusions to 20th-century totalitarianism, while the battered and dispersed good guys carry some of the romance of guerrilla resistance, taking to the countryside and living rough as they search for weak spots in their enemy’s strategy. They also pop into nonmagical neighborhoods of London, visits that add a jolt of realism to this fantasy. The brilliant composer Alexandre Desplat has constructed a haunting, spooky sonic atmosphere with only an occasional splash of youthful whimsy.Not that “Deathly Hallows” is grim, exactly. But it is, to an unusual and somewhat risky degree, sadder and slower than the earlier films. It is also much less of a showcase (or bank vault, as the case may be) for the middle and senior generations of British actors. Many of the familiar faces show up — including Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix LeStrange, and, of course, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape — but they move along after a scene or two. So do the two notable newcomers, Bill Nighy as a government official and Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood, a wondrously eccentric underground journalist and father to the ethereal (and in this movie, briefly glimpsed) Luna (Evanna Lynch).The movie, in other words, belongs solidly to Mr. Radcliffe, Mr. Grint and Ms. Watson, who have grown into nimble actors, capable of nuances of feeling that would do their elders proud. One of the great pleasures of this penultimate “Potter” movie is the anticipation of stellar post-“Potter” careers for all three of them.While there is still one more film to go (Part 2 is scheduled for release in July), this one manages to be both a steppingstone and a reasonably satisfying experience in its own right. Some plot elements are handled with busy, “DaVinci Code”-like mumbo jumbo as the three friends must hunt down not only a bunch of horcruxes, but also the mysterious objects alluded to in the title. The deathly hallows at least provide the occasion for a lovely animated sequence, much as the inevitable preliminary battle scenes allow for episodes of explosive wand work. Even though it ends in the middle, “Deathly Hallows: Part 1” finds notes of anxious suspense and grave emotion to send its characters, and its fans, into the last round. The sorrow you experience may well be a premonition of the imminent end of a long and, for the most part, delightful relationship.“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

SCOTT,Review: ‘Notfilm’ Tells How Beckett and Keaton Collaborated,"Samuel Beckett and Buster Keaton surely possess two of the most photogenic faces of the 20th century, contrasting images of haplessness and stoicism. Beckett’s deeply lined visage, surmounted by a sweep of silver hair, is an emblem of late modernism, a quietly charismatic mask of weary resolve in the face of existential absurdity. Keaton’s smooth brow and melancholy deadpan, customarily shadowed by a porkpie hat, express an ingenious, innocent determination to surmount whatever obstacles the universe imposes.The two men can also look like kindred artistic spirits, committed to formal rigor and possessing finely tuned comic sensibilities. It is not surprising — though it is also, somehow, astonishing — that they worked together once, on a film devised by Beckett and titled “Film.” A little more than 20 minutes long, devoid of dialogue (though not of sound), it was made in New York in the summer of 1965. And it is now the subject of an intelligent, affectionate documentary by Ross Lipman, titled “Notfilm.” (A restoration of the Beckett short, directed by his faithful collaborator Alan Schneider, accompanies Mr. Lipman’s film during its run at Anthology Film Archives.)Mr. Lipman’s title has several connotations. It’s a declaration of modest intentions, for one thing. It also evokes “Not I,” the fevered monologue — delivered by a disembodied mouth — that is numbered among Beckett’s theatrical masterpieces. And there is more than a hint of Beckettian self-reference, since Mr. Lipman’s project, motivated partly by his work as a preservationist, is very much an artifact of the digital age. A charming, earnest, sometimes ungainly mixture of history, criticism and high-minded gossip, “Notfilm” testifies to an almost inexhaustible fascination with the pleasures and paradoxes of cinema.While “Film” was to be Beckett’s only foray into the medium — and not, it must be said, an entirely successful one — his collaborators were prominent figures in movie history. In addition to Keaton, there was Boris Kaufman, an important cinematographer and the younger brother of the great Soviet director and documentarian Dziga Vertov. Mr. Lipman makes much of that connection, and threads “Notfilm” with lovely clips from Vertov’s films and other silent treasures.These are accompanied by voice-over narration that is witty and meditative, and that pushes against the constraints of the “making of” documentary template. Mr. Lipman has much to say about the making and transmission of moving images, about the role of the movie camera in modern life and about the philosophical underpinnings of Beckett’s literary and theatrical vision. At times you may wish he had absorbed some of Beckett’s — or Keaton’s — ferocious discipline. Both of them were masters of pared-down precision and elegant understatement. Mr. Lipman’s sensibility, by contrast, is expansive and digressive, attracted to loftiness and sweep.But that is, in the end, a good thing. The work of Beckett is an invitation to think, and it’s an invitation Mr. Lipman accepts with alacrity. Happily, “Notfilm” does not neglect behind-the-scenes anecdotes. Though many of the participants are no longer living, there are illuminating interviews with Jean Schneider, the widow of the director of “Film,” and with James Karen, a familiar character actor and close friend of Keaton’s who had a role in “Film.” These conversations are supplemented with other reminiscences and ruminations, by archival stills and clips, and by extraordinary audio recordings of script readings.Beckett was fascinated and troubled by the mechanical reproduction, by the ways various recording machines both assuage and intensify the alienation of modern life. Extracts from Keaton’s work, in particular “The Cameraman,” suggest that he had similar interests, though he was always more concerned with technique than theory, and did not think much of Beckett or “Film.” All the same, Keaton’s performance in it is full of pathos and professionalism, as is “Notfilm,” which in exploring the intersection between the Beckettian and the Keatonesque finds a hitherto uncharted dimension of human and cinematic experience.“Notfilm” is not rated.

But the Dominican-born Derrick has higher aspirations for a college future and regular support payments for his two young children, and when Army recruiters come calling — assuring him that a war with Iraq is “not gonna happen” — he makes a decision he will come to regret.Tender, wise and deceptively low-key, “Liberty Kid” reaches beyond its vulnerable protagonists to enfold an entire class of circumstantial victims. Gently nudging her story in unexpected directions, Ms. Chaiken never allows her small budget to show: from Eliot Rockett’s beautifully lighted  photography to the ease with which the actors inhabit their roles, everything about this film feels effortless. Even a support-group scene featuring real Iraq war veterans, which could have appeared jarringly staged, rings with understated authenticity.Focusing on the quotidian over the episodic, “Liberty Kid” quietly accumulates emotional power. Not until the graceful, perfectly judged conclusion do we realize how much we care.LIBERTY KIDOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Ilya Chaiken; director of photography, Eliot Rockett; edited by Dave Rock; music by Jeff Grace; production designer, Jesse Cain; produced by Larry Fessenden, Mike S.

Lewis’s series, far, far away. But where would it go? Both Never Land and Wonderland are occupied, courtesy of the Walt Disney Company, which helped produce the first “Narnia” movies, the fairly diverting “Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” and the disappointing “Prince Caspian.” Now 20th Century Fox has taken up the franchise with largely dreary results.The series has a new director, the generally reliable Michael Apted, who established his rapport with wee ones years ago with “7 Up!,” the first in a documentary series that has revisited the same group of British men and women in new movies every seven years since 1964, when the participants were squirmy 7-year-olds. Though Mr. Apted brings a few minor idiosyncrasies to “Dawn Treader” — notably with his riskily off-putting direction of the young actor Will Poulter, a “Narnia” newcomer — a strong filmmaking voice was clearly not called for in an entertainment that has been carefully calibrated for maximum blandness. Mr. Apted is aboard to keep the franchise sailing along or at least afloat, which he does.Mr. Poulter is by far the most unexpected ingredient in the new adventure, primarily because his aggressive, chatterbox performance digs under your skin, which, as it turns out, is what makes it finally work. First seen in the independent film “Son of Rambow,” Mr. Poulter here plays Eustace Scrubb, a cousin of Lucy and Edmund Pevensie (Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes), who, with their brother Peter and sister Susan discovered Narnia. Three books and several years later, Britain is still at war, and Lucy and Edmund are squirreled away with Eustace’s family, to his loquacious displeasure. As he greedily hoards his sweets and mutters invectives, you can see the next Mike Leigh misanthrope being born before your eyes.He keeps up the grumbling even after a maritime painting on a wall turns into a Niagara Falls, flooding a bedroom with imaginative computer-generated water and sweeping him, Lucy and Edmund out to sea. They’re soon rescued by their old comrade in arms, King Caspian (Ben Barnes), who is manning the Dawn Treader with a squeaky clean crew of men and talking beasts, including an armed (and tailed) mouse-kateer, Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg). Backslapping and strained comic bits ensue, including a sword fight between a disbelieving Eustace and Reepicheep, a kind of furry Jiminy Cricket but without the mellifluous pipes. The ship makes a few pit stops on enchanted islands, amid boatloads of exposition, which reinforce the sense that it’s a long way before the series will drop anchor.It remains to be seen whether we’ll get there — there are four more books — though it would help if a better balance were struck between the actors, most of whom could use a firmer hand, and the special effects. (This one comes in 3-D, a wasted effort.) Though there are times when the movie turns into a congested mess, as in a climactic battle that washes the screen in gray, there are moments when you also see a quieter, less industrial production. Such is the case after Eustace is turned into a grand, ungainly, unhappy dragon. When he lies forlornly on a beach, or as forlornly as dragons do, and a monstrous-size tear slides down his scaly face, you don’t just see the wizardry magic, you also see the human touch behind it.“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” is rated PG.

He snatches homeless children off the streets — many are addicts — and takes them to Pilgrim Republic, the rehabilitation center he founded in the city of Mariupol.According to Mr. Mokhnenko, the home sometimes functions as a prison, sometimes as a hospital. Seeing a proliferation of street kids, drug use, domestic abuse and AIDS following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Mokhnenko, who likens himself to a caring animated character in a Russian children’s movie, takes initiative without authority. He has even adopted some of the children.This brand of tough-love priest isn’t unique to this former member of the Eastern bloc: An American counterpart might be the pastor Michael Pfleger, an activist on Chicago’s South Side. But “Almost Holy” grows repetitive with Mr. Mokhnenko’s pep talks. It becomes more interesting when he ponders the “criticism” section on his Wikipedia page and, toward the end, when the film shifts its emphasis to consider the broader political context of Ukraine.The title “Almost Holy” notwithstanding, the director, Steve Hoover, barely stops short of nominating his subject for sainthood. This is the case despite one remarkable scene in which Mr. Mokhnenko angrily warns a man accused of rape, “Don’t force me to sin.”“Almost Holy” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

(The film is a sequel to Mr. Trueba’s “The Girl of Your Dreams,” from 1998, about a Third Reich engagement with Spanish showbiz.) In “Queen,” an opening montage evoking newsreels describes Franco’s invitation to American studios to shoot in Spain.Penélope Cruz, who also starred in “The Girl of Your Dreams,” is back as Macarena Granada, now a Hollywood superstar who, having acquired American citizenship, returns to her native Spain for a lavish American-Spanish coproduction about Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Blas Fontiveros (Antonio Resines), a former director exiled in France (and an ex-paramour of Macarena’s), has sneaked back into the Spanish industry, working second-unit. After he is discovered by the authorities, Blas is banished to a labor camp, and a group that includes Macarena, her assistant (Loles Léon), married crew hands (Santiago Segura and Neus Asensi) and a bumbling actor (Jorge Sanz) must smuggle him back to France.Mr. Trueba skillfully blends genuine and mock period footage to conjure the era, while Mandy Patinkin, as a blacklisted screenwriter; Cary Elwes, as a loutish American leading man; and Clive Revill, sending up John Ford, ably help represent the Hollywood contingent. As for Ms. Cruz, she luminously revisits the role of a screen diva who, when the country’s dictator visits the set, is not above telling him off in the most delightfully coarse of terms.",0,,,1
489,2013-11-27,Philomena,"Judi Dench, Steve Coogan, Sophie Kennedy Clark, Mare Winningham","UK, USA, France",Stephen Frears,"Biography, Drama",English,77.0,98.0,"Steve Coogan (screenplay), Jeff Pope (screenplay), Martin Sixsmith (book)",2013,7.6,86406.0,91.0,2017-11-02 04:18:18,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Nasty Nuns Can’t Shake a Faith,"In “Philomena,” Judi Dench’s portrayal of a stubborn, kindhearted Irish Catholic trying to discover what became of the toddler she was forced to give up as a teenager is so quietly moving that it feels lit from within. A major theme of this film from Stephen Frears is forgiveness. Ms. Dench’s Philomena Lee glows with the radiance of someone serene in her faith despite inhumane treatment by the church. That she makes you believe her character has the capacity to forgive provides the movie with a solid moral center. Ms. Dench’s dignified performance and the screenplay — adapted by her co-star Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmith’s 2009 nonfiction book, “The Lost Child of Philomena Lee” — stabilize a volatile blend of ingredients. In less confident hands, the film could have been a mawkish, rambling tear-jerker. “Philomena” has many facets. It is a comedic road movie, a detective story, an infuriated anticlerical screed, and an inquiry into faith and the limitations of reason, all rolled together. Fairly sophisticated about spiritual matters, it takes pains to distinguish faith from institutionalized piety. It also has a surprising political subtext in its comparison of the church’s oppression and punishment of unmarried sex — what the convent’s harsh mother superior denounces as “carnal incontinence” — with homophobia and the United States government’s reluctance to deal with the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Philomena recalls sensing that her son, even when he was a tot, would grow up to be gay.Ms. Dench, who is more accustomed to playing cool, imperious matriarchs than twinkling little old ladies, knows exactly how far to push the inherent cuteness of her role without it curdling into shtick. Her Philomena, for all her surface prudishness, shyly admits to having happy, guilt-free memories of the liaison that got her in trouble. Even more surprisingly, she professes a matter-of-fact acceptance of homosexuality. Her equanimity on the subject may be a little far-fetched given her age and background, but her independent spirit suggests that such an attitude is not beyond the realm of possibility.The teenage Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark) becomes pregnant in 1952 and is sent to a convent in Roscrea, Ireland. She spends several years in virtual slave labor, working in the convent laundry. It is part punishment and part compensation to the nuns who looked after her during childbirth. These prisonlike convent laundries, where shamed parents exiled their “bad” daughters, were the subject of Peter Mullan’s 2002 film, “The Magdalene Sisters,” and of a Joni Mitchell song.The girls are allowed to see their children only one hour a day, and Philomena is forced to sign a contract agreeing never to inquire into her son’s whereabouts. In the film’s most anguished scene, she is beside herself as she watches from a convent window as the child, Anthony, is whisked away in a car by a wealthy American couple. The 3-year-old boy had been sold for 1,000 pounds.Fifty years later, Philomena, in her 70s, meets Martin Sixsmith (Mr. Coogan), a onetime BBC foreign correspondent who was later ousted as a spin doctor in Tony Blair’s government and is now obliged to support himself with freelance journalism assignments. Martin, a cynic and an atheist, persuades an initially reluctant Philomena to cooperate with him on a magazine article telling her story. When they visit the convent, they are coldly informed that all records from the time were destroyed in a fire.The film widens its focus when Martin’s sleuthing reveals the probable whereabouts of Anthony, who worked for the Reagan administration. Philomena insists on accompanying Martin when he flies to Washington. The movie can’t resist finding comedy in this unlikely team. Philomena, a devotee of romance novels, tries Martin’s patience by relaying the plots of the novels she reads. Instead of visiting the Lincoln Memorial, she would rather watch the movie “Big Momma’s House” on television at the hotel. Martin is arrogant, bordering on boorish in his pursuit of the story, and Mr. Coogan does an impressive job of muting his comedian’s instincts to paint him as intimidatingly brusque.Even through improbable moments and abrupt changes of pace and tone, Ms. Dench and Mr. Coogan hold the movie together and pull forward a story that ends where it began. In giving equal weight to Martin’s skepticism and Philomena’s faith, it manages to have its cake and eat it too. “Philomena” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some strong language and sexual references.",1,,37709979.0,0

For a land often perched on the edge of ruin, she says, mere survival is something to celebrate.Directed by Mark Jonathan Harris and Oles Sanin, the film starts with a rundown of a history that has repeated itself for centuries — invaders have long prized Ukraine for its resources and geography, and modern times are no exception.Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has been subject to constant pressure from Russia, whose forces seized Crimea in 2014 then intervened to support armed separatists in Eastern Ukraine.The filmmakers supply terrifying footage: At civilian rallies, we see nightstick beatings and bloody riots. During military battles, bullets whiz by and explosions shake the cameras. Nerve-racking scenes follow Ukraine’s extraordinarily bold volunteer soldiers.Just as disturbing is an analysis of Russia’s worldwide fake news campaign, which spreads contradictory reports and Kremlin-friendly propaganda. “The Russians understand Western media far better than the Western media understands itself,” one interviewee says. “And they play to the Western media’s short attention span.” Another says: “Disinformation destroys reality. The Russians are masters of this — they have built a parallel reality.”“Breaking Point,” subtitled “The War for Democracy in Ukraine,” ends on an uneasy note, as hostilities with Russia persist and as Ukraine strives to rebuild. All of those interviewed carry anxiety in their voices. They, along with Mr. Harris and Mr. Sanin, know that with this country’s dark past, it’s risky to bet on a bright future.",0,,,0
491,2011-04-15,Potiche,"Catherine Deneuve, Gérard Depardieu, Fabrice Luchini, Karin Viard",France,François Ozon,Comedy,French,68.0,103.0,"François Ozon (scenario), Pierre Barillet (play), Jean-Pierre Grédy (play)",2010,6.4,9288.0,83.0,2017-11-02 04:18:13,A. O. SCOTT,Labor Strife? Send in the Boss’s Wife,"The experience of watching François Ozon’s “Potiche (Trophy Wife)” is, in many ways, more like attending a theatrical matinee than like going out for a night at the movies. This is not only because Mr. Ozon’s source is a once popular, slightly musty play from the 1970s (by the writing team of Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Grédy), which he has lovingly refurbished with impeccable attention to period décor and present-day sensitivities. Mr. Ozon, a prolific filmmaker, has also, perhaps intentionally, approximated the stodgy good cheer that often distinguishes lavish, star-studded stage revivals of beloved old chestnuts. You suspect, before long, that there is no strong reason for this production to exist, but it is reasonably good fun all the same.And there are at least two perfectly defensible reasons to see “Potiche”: Catherine Deneuve and Gérard Depardieu, monuments of French cinema who also prove, not for the first time, to be game and disciplined professionals, bestowing their talents on a less than exalted cause. They comport themselves with a beguiling blend of panache and precision.At this point, as living embodiments of French cinema — Mr. Depardieu has now attained a physical size to match his monumental cultural stature — they can hardly be expected to disappear into their roles. Ms. Deneuve may wear the clothes of a dowdy bourgeois housewife, and Mr. Depardieu may assume some of the tics of a beleaguered, anxious bureaucrat, but their charisma is immune to fashion or time. She will always be impossibly glamorous, just as he will always be rough, handsome and a little dangerous.The two stars — Ms. Deneuve playing the hemmed-in wife of an industrialist, Mr. Depardieu a political tribune of the aggrieved proletariat — set a tone of sly, high-spirited sincerity that is matched by the rest of the cast, which includes Fabrice Luchini, Karin Viard, Judith Godrèche and Jérémie Renier. These able actors tackle a busy tale of marital discord and class conflict that takes place in the politically anxious year of 1977 and is set in motion by labor unrest at the umbrella factory run by Robert Pujol (Mr. Luchini).An imperious boss and a negligent, philandering husband — his long-suffering secretary, Nadège (Ms. Viard), is also his longtime mistress — Pujol almost too neatly personifies the shortcomings of his class and sex. His wife, Suzanne (Ms. Deneuve), whose father started the factory and is occasionally invoked as the embodiment of a benevolent, bygone paternalism, seems resigned to her lot in life. First seen in a red track suit and white Adidas, with curlers tucked under a matronly kerchief, Suzanne scribbles verses in a notebook, endures her husband’s grouchiness and keeps a doting eye on her two grown children, Joëlle (Ms. Godrèche) and Laurent (Mr. Renier).When the workers take their boss hostage in his office, the machinery of boulevard farce lumbers into motion, ornamented by Mr. Ozon’s fussy touches of pastiche. The Pujol factory cannot help calling to mind Jacques Demy’s “Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” which made Ms. Deneuve an international movie star in 1964, but “Potiche” is more thoroughly infused with a later, more decadent era of French politics and pop culture. On the walls are pictures of Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the aristocratic president of the republic at the time, and also of Georges Marchais, then the head of the French Communist Party, to which Mr. Depardieu’s character, a member of Parliament named Babin, has pledged his fealty. More colorfully, there are ascots and pantsuits and a telephone upholstered in what appears to be green corduroy, and pop songs in both French and English.More substantively, there is an attempt to pay tribute to the feminist struggles of the 1970s while maintaining a knowing distance from the attitudes of the old days. Mme. Pujol is a potiche, a French word translated in the subtitles and press materials, somewhat misleadingly, as “trophy wife.” But rather than being a young sexual prize, as the English term implies, our heroine is a taken-for-granted status symbol, a token of her husband’s respectability and prestige. In taking his place as the boss, though, she becomes much more, and Ms. Deneuve conveys her empowerment with a light touch, mingling delight and amusement. And as the film proceeds, it divulges some interesting tidbits about her past, including her affair with Babin, who now becomes, in no particular order, her adversary, adviser and passionate suitor.“Potiche” goes down easy, even as it goes on a bit too long. Mr. Ozon creates a look and mood of high retrocomedy, but his pacing, within scenes and from one to the next, is slow and clumsy, preventing the plot from gathering the momentum it needs. While he clearly enjoys messing around with a silly, antiquated play, he is too polite to offer the strong revisionist interpretation that the material invites. He is fond of the past, indulgent of its foibles and covetous of its stuff, but he is, in the end, less a historian than a collector of knick-knacks and trophies.“Potiche” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"Two Siblings Stuck in a Junkyard World, Struggling to Survive and Dream","Because the last shot of Ramin Bahrani’s “Chop Shop” is as quiet and matter-of-fact as most of the rest of the film, it takes a moment to register as a metaphor. For nearly an hour and a half we have been immersed in the rhythms of daily life in the battered Willets Point section of Queens, and Mr. Bahrani’s hand-held camera has remained studiously fixed at street level. Now, all of a sudden, it pitches upward to follow a flock of pigeons breaking toward the sky, a shift in perspective that also changes, subtly but unmistakably, our understanding of the movie.Like its prosaic title, or like those homely birds, “Chop Shop,” written by Mr. Bahrani and Bahareh Azimi, dwells mainly in the realm of the literal. Filmed inside shady auto-repair businesses, on bleak overpasses and in vacant lots in the shadow of Shea Stadium, this film, like Mr. Bahrani’s  2006 feature, “Man Push Cart,”  is concerned principally with the kind of hard, marginal labor that more comfortable city dwellers rarely notice. But there is nonetheless a lyricism at its heart, an unsentimental, soulful appreciation of the grace that resides in even the meanest struggle for survival.When you stop to think about it, the life of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco)  — known as Ale     — should be cause for despair. A skinny, fast-moving boy a year or so  from puberty, he sleeps in a makeshift room above the shop where he works. His main concern, aside from the daily scramble  for cash, is his older sister, Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who seems more passive than her brother and more detached, perhaps self-protectively, from her emotions. Their parents are never seen or mentioned, and school is more an abstract notion than a real possibility.Ale’s plan, equally a childish fantasy and a hard-headed entrepreneurial scheme, is to save enough money to buy a broken-down vending truck and fix it up so he and Isamar can sell hot meals to chop shop workers and customers. Isamar works in a similar business and also sells sex after-hours  to drivers who park at the edge of the neighborhood. Ale’s desire, all the more acute for remaining unstated, is to rescue her from this fate and also, more generally, to formulate the plausible idea of a secure adult future for the two of them.Mr. Bahrani does not treat his characters with pity, and they feel very little for themselves. Perhaps this is because they are too young, and too focused on the present-tense demands of getting by, to dwell on what they don’t have. But the film’s emotional restraint, while impressive, also feels limiting. Mr. Polanco and Ms. Gonzales have the wary inscrutability that often characterizes nonprofessional actors, and though Mr. Polanco is a lively and likable presence, there are times when his performance is tentative and stiff.Mr. Bahrani was born in the United States and lived for a while in Iran, his parents’ native country (and Ms. Azimi’s), and the influence of recent Iranian cinema on “Chop Shop” is unmistakable. The oblique, naturalistic storytelling, the interest in children and the mingling of documentary and fictional techniques — these have been hallmarks of the work of Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi, but they are rarely deployed  with such confidence or effectiveness by American filmmakers. “Chop Shop” suggests the potential of such an approach, which has roots in postwar Italian Neo-realism, to compel an encounter with local reality that is both poetic and clearsighted.Whether the situation in “Chop Shop” is entirely realistic is another question. I found myself wondering not only about what had happened to Ale and Isamar’s parents, but also about the total absence of any adult or institutional concern with these children’s lives. The shop owners pay Ale his wages and teach him new skills, but there is a hardness in their dealings with him that struck me as implausible. That may be wishful thinking on my part. Or it may be that I was taken in by the rough surface of this film, seduced into mistaking a subtle, artful fable for the cold, hard facts of life.CHOP SHOPOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Directed and edited by Ramin Bahrani; written by Bahareh Azimi and Mr. Bahrani; director of photography, Michael Simmonds; production designer, Richard Wright; produced by Lisa Muskat, Marc Turtletaub and Jeb Brody; released by Koch Lorber Films.

493,2010-01-22,Extraordinary Measures,"Brendan Fraser, Harrison Ford, Keri Russell, Meredith Droeger",USA,Tom Vaughan,Drama,English,45.0,106.0,"Robert Nelson Jacobs, Geeta Anand (book)",2010,6.5,15305.0,28.0,2017-11-02 04:18:10,A. O. SCOTT,Desperate Father’s Plea to a Detached Scientist,"“Extraordinary Measures,” a movie about a medical breakthrough, is not especially eager to break new ground of its own. Directed with care and competence by Tom Vaughan (“What Happens in Vegas”), the film hews closely to familiar themes and patterns. One strand is a drama about a family in crisis, with parents facing the illness and possible death of two of their children, who suffer from a fatal genetic disorder. Another piece is a buddy picture, in which a mismatched pair of guys — one earnest and emotive (Brendan Fraser), the other gruff and solitary (Harrison Ford) — set off on an unlikely adventure, hoping to find a cure.But also, and more unusually, the film, adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from a nonfiction book by the journalist Geeta Anand, is an examination of how medical research is conducted and financed. This is the main reason that “Extraordinary Measures,” the first feature released by CBS Films, rises above some of its made-for-TV trappings. (The presence of established big-screen stars doesn’t hurt either.)The storytelling and the visual style are rarely more than workmanlike, and the big scenes arrive punctually and are played with minimal nuance. But the dogged, unflashy presentation of emotionally charged, complicated material works to the film’s advantage. The lump-in-the-throat elements take care of themselves — the sight of sweet and lively children in hospital beds has a way of opening up audience tear ducts, even without swelling musical cues — but the startling thing about “Extraordinary Measures” is not that it moves you. It’s that you feel, at the end, that you have learned something about the way the world works.Mr. Fraser, his eternal boyishness comfortably expanding in a pudgy 40-something frame, plays John Crowley, a midlevel executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb whose two younger children, a son and a daughter, suffer from a rare, inherited form of muscular dystrophy called Pompe’s disease. (The oldest son, played by Sam M. Hall, is unaffected).John and his wife, Aileen (Keri Russell), do their best to give Megan (Meredith Droeger) and Patrick (Diego Velazquez), who use wheelchairs and breathing tubes, a normal life, with bowling alley birthday parties and trips to the beach. After the rest of the family has gone to bed, John rifles through scholarly journals and trawls the Internet, searching for some inkling of a cure and wondering how much time Megan and Patrick have left.His inquiries lead him to Robert Stonehill, a University of Nebraska professor played with sublime cantankerousness by Harrison Ford (and a composite character based on several scientists portrayed in Ms. Anand’s book). Motivated by sheer scientific curiosity, and impelled by a stubborn, go-it-alone work ethic, Stonehill thinks he has isolated an enzyme that has the potential to arrest the progress of Pompe’s disease, which usually kills its victims at the age of 8 or 9.Crowley impulsively promises to finance Stonehill’s experiments and hurriedly sets up a foundation for that purpose. But they soon abandon the nonprofit route and put together a start-up company in the middle of the prairie. This requires tense visits with venture capitalists (including one played by the ever-silky David Clennon and then a plan, resisted by Stonehill, to sell out to a big biotechnology firm in Seattle).The evolution of their business plan, along with the pursuit of the treatment that will save Megan and Patrick, is what holds “Extraordinary Measures” together. This is not to say that the movie is a bloodless scientific procedural. Crowley’s visits home, and Ms. Droeger’s adorable spunkiness, prevent that. But the film resists the temptation to turn into a full-blown family melodrama. There are tensions and stresses between John and Aileen, but they also deal with an awful situation in the matter-of-fact, practical way that loving parents often do, and the film is all the more moving because, for the most part, it understates their grief and anxiety.And the temperamental contrast between Stonehill and Crowley is also handled without too much exaggeration, though of course there are the requisite scenes of seething and shouting and storming in and out of offices. The desperate father’s impatience is often at odds with the scientist’s detachment, but “Extraordinary Measures” is ultimately about how feeling and objectivity can work together, and also about how the protocols of medical research and development can both enable and obstruct progress.While there is one corporate heavy — an executive played by Jared Harris — he is less a villain than the embodiment of a way of doing business that both Crowley and Stonehill must contend with. And even if he seems hard-hearted and bureaucratic in his insistence on conducting experiments and clinical trials by the book, the filmmakers don’t suggest that he’s entirely wrong. Nor do they offer a simplistic account, either scolding or celebratory, of the relationship between big money and medical progress. The result, while nothing extraordinary, is nonetheless satisfying.“Extraordinary Measures” is rated PG. Mild swearing and children in distress.EXTRAORDINARY MEASURESOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Tom Vaughan; written by Robert Nelson Jacobs, based on the book “The Cure” by Geeta Anand; director of photography, Andrew Dunn; edited by Anne V.

(Filmed for the party’s 90th anniversary, “Revival” had a colossal release at home; the State Film Commission sought at least 30 million viewers.) Its principal focus is the May Fourth Movement, which sprang from failed government efforts to wrest Shandong Province from foreign control at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, resulting in student riots in Beijing.Anyone unfamiliar with the history may be dazed by the dense condensation of events. Narrative subtitles and fleeting identifications of famous figures barely help. The cast teems: look closely and you’ll find Chow Yun-Fat as Yuan Yuan Shih-kai, the delusional early president of the Republic of China, and the director John Woo as the future president Lin Sen. As the firebrand intellectual Chen Duxiu, Feng Yuanzheng is a forceful presence. Towering over all is Mao Zedong, portrayed by Liu Ye as modest and sensitive; the film’s chaste love story is Mao’s courtship of Yang Kaihui (Li Qin, deferential and immaculate).Despite battle scenes, there’s little blood, just plenty of ponderously earnest cant about the dictatorship of the proletariat. Employing Hollywood flourishes like split screen and digital effects, “Revival” is a proud statement by an ascendant society.

O. SCOTT,An Unbeliever in Disney World,"“Saving Mr. Banks,” released by Disney, is a movie about the making of a Disney movie (“Mary Poppins”), in which Walt Disney himself (played by Tom Hanks) is a major character. It includes a visit to Disneyland and, if you look closely, a teaser for its companion theme park in Florida (as yet unbuilt, when the story takes place). A large Mickey Mouse plush toy appears from time to time to provide an extra touch of humor and warmth. But it would be unfair to dismiss this picture, directed by John Lee Hancock from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, as an exercise in corporate self-promotion. It’s more of a mission statement.It also revisits a proud moment in the company’s history: the making of “Mary Poppins,” at the time (the early ’60s) the most expensive live-action film Disney had produced, and eventually one of the most lucrative and beloved. More precisely, “Saving Mr. Banks” recounts the consummation, in business and creative terms, of Walt Disney’s long courtship of P. L. Travers, the creator of Mary Poppins, played with spirited fussiness by Emma Thompson. Fans of the book and the earlier movie will know that Mr. Banks is the father of the children cared for by Mary Poppins, but even those entirely innocent of her previous literary and cinematic incarnations — if such people exist — will find this movie accessible and enjoyable.That is part of the Disney brand, of course: fun for everyone, with a spoonful of therapeutic medicine to help the sugar seem nutritious. The best parts of “Saving Mr. Banks” offer an embellished, tidied-up but nonetheless reasonably authentic glimpse of the Disney entertainment machine at work.Mrs. Travers, as she insists on being called, is a starchy, grouchy Londoner whose books have stopped selling. At the urging of her agent, she submits to the ordeal of a first-class flight to Los Angeles, a suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel and daily limousine service to Burbank, where she is plied with cookies, snack cakes, Jell-O squares and, when she insists on it, tea. None of this Southern California hospitality — or the friendliness of her driver (an unusually sunny Paul Giamatti) — melts Mrs. Travers’s determination to protect her creation from Disney’s whimsy. “I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons,” she declares. Walt, aware that he does not yet have the rights to “Mary Poppins,” grants her script approval. She proceeds to torment the screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the songwriting team of Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak) with objections about everything from casting to costumes to the grammar of the screenplay. The audience, meanwhile, is treated to stripped-down, in-progress versions of songs from “Mary Poppins,” notably the infectious “Let’s Go Fly a Kite.” But this is not just the tale of how the happy artisans of Hollywood and their boss soften the heart of an uptight Englishwoman (who was actually born in Australia). It is that, of course. Ms. Thompson has no peer when it comes to British stiffness, and Mr. Hanks is a master of evocative facial hair, American regional accents and earnest likability. His Missouri twang, mellowed by the California sun, is as friendly and reassuring as the real Walt Disney’s used to be every Sunday night when he introduced his television broadcast. Usually preceded by an off-screen cough — a premonition of the lung cancer that would kill him a couple of years after the “Mary Poppins” premiere — Walt is less a mogul than a kind and reliable daddy. He dotes on his intellectual properties (the mouse, the park, the picture) as if they were his children. He wants to adapt Mrs. Travers’s novel to keep a promise to his daughters.As it turns out — as we discover long before Walt does — the author’s own daddy issues are at the heart of her reluctance to play nice in the Disney creative sandbox. “Saving Mr. Banks” toggles between 1961 Burbank and a dusty village in Australia more than half a century before, when the future P. L. Travers was a little girl named Helen Goff (Annie Rose Buckley), nicknamed Ginty by her beloved father (Colin Farrell). An impish, imaginative fellow, he is also a hopeless alcoholic, barely able to hold onto his job managing a bank, and causing his poor wife (Ruth Wilson) no end of worry.Mr. Hancock (“The Blind Side”) integrates the two plots — the charming backstage comedy and the Down Under family melodrama — as smoothly as he can. As is often the case in movies structured this way, though, the elements distort rather than illuminate each other. The tale of Ginty and her dad is thick with dubious sentiment and leavened with glimmers of sensitive wisdom, but the light it casts on the grown-up Mrs. Travers is harshly literal. The film asks us to believe that she is at once an astute storyteller and an emotional automaton entirely lacking in psychological insight. It also indulges in the common biographical fallacy of grounding adult creativity in childhood misery. Walt and Mrs. Travers have that in common, and Walt, in a late, decisive conversation, explains that their job as storytellers is to “restore order” to the chaos of life and infuse bleak realities with bright, happy colors. Imagination, in other words, is a form of repression. Joy is a kind of denial. Mary Poppins may have had a different idea: She is, on the page, committed to solving problems rather than wishing them away. But the Disney version has proved more powerful, more seductive and, it almost goes without saying, more profitable.“Saving Mr. Banks” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"Review: Resettling the Meaning of Home in ‘Brooklyn,’ With Saoirse Ronan","Many American families cherish faded memories of the Old Neighborhood and the Old Country, places that help supply both a sense of identity and a story of progress — complementary answers to the question “Where do we come from?”“Brooklyn,” a lovely film based on the even lovelier novel by Colm Toibin, feels like an answer to that question. Set in its titular borough and in a small Irish town in the early 1950s, it is both sharply observed and gently nostalgic.“Brooklyn” is an old photograph without a frame, an implied flashback. Nothing in the film takes place in the present, but everything in it is carried on an invisible current of imaginative retrospection. Like its literary source, the movie, directed by John Crowley (“Boy A”) and written by Nick Hornby, feels like the result of a child or grandchild’s inquiry into the lives of a previous generation. How did Mom and Dad meet? What were they like? Why did they get married? Where did we come from? It’s quite a tale, and also a perfectly ordinary series of events, strung together by chance, choice and perhaps a touch of grace.At one point, Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) — the Irish lass whose coming-of-age is the film’s principal interest and reason for being — takes an excursion with Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), her Brooklyn beau. Standing on a windswept patch of grass out on Long Island, Tony spins a vision of a nice house and a thriving family plumbing business: a quiet, prosperous life beyond the cramped confines of the city. Sitting in the theater, the 21st-century viewer can fill in the blanks, conjuring a time-lapse picture of the growth of the suburbs and the unfolding of a long marriage. Tony and Eilis grow old before our eyes, and the world changes around them. The Dodgers go to Los Angeles. The kids go to college. Some of them eventually move back to Brooklyn.But it isn’t that simple, really. And it’s also much simpler. “Brooklyn” endows its characters with desires and aspirations, but not with foresight, and it examines the past with open-minded curiosity rather than with sentimentality or easy judgment. Its New York and Irish landscapes are both romantic and constricting. There are streetcars, rooming houses and department stores on one side of the ocean, tidy shops and dark-paneled pubs on the other. There are also a lot of rules and expectations for young people, women in particular. Eilis does not experience these norms as unduly oppressive. They are what she’s used to and also, as such, the condition of her freedom.She leaves home not to flee political violence or desperate poverty — as millions of earlier immigrants from Ireland and other parts of Europe did — but to escape the narrowness and limited opportunities of her hometown. She leaves behind a mother (Jane Brennan) and an older sister (Fiona Glascott), and endures seasickness on the boat to New York and homesickness once she arrives.The streets of Brooklyn are not paved with gold, but there is a room in a brownstone and a position as a sales clerk waiting for Eilis when she arrives. She is counseled by a benevolent priest (Jim Broadbent), looked after by a sharp-tongued landlady (Julie Walters) and instructed in the ways of American femininity by her supervisor at work (Jessica Paré) and by the other residents of the boardinghouse. After a while, Eilis’s loneliness starts to abate. She takes night classes in accounting and does very well. She meets Tony and his Italian-American family, who are about one meatball away from being complete ethnic stereotypes but hard to resist for just that reason.When a family emergency summons Eilis back to Ireland, “Brooklyn” discovers its plot and reveals the stakes of its heroine’s story. And heroic she is, even though her drama is firmly anchored in the mundane. At home, she finds familiar comforts and also a new suitor, a local boy grown into handsome Domhnall Gleeson. Eilis’s romantic predicament is agonizing, for her and also for the viewer. I can’t remember the last time I cared so much about the marital prospects of a fictional character, and I don’t think that’s just because it’s in my nature to root for a guy named Tony against a skinny redhead.The real reason is Ms. Ronan, who has grown from an uncannily intelligent child actor into a screen performer of remarkable force and sensitivity. On the page, Eilis comes alive through the fineness of Mr. Toibin’s prose. A devotee of Henry James, he registers the fluctuations of the character’s inner weather with meteorological precision. Inwardness is a great challenge for filmmakers. The human face is a wall as well as a window. Words lose their power. Everything depends on the ability of actors to communicate nuances of feeling and fluctuations of consciousness.And Ms. Ronan uses everything — her posture, her eyebrows, her breath, her teeth, her pores — to convey a process of change that is both seismic and subtle. Eilis is in transit, and to some degree in limbo, caught between two stages of life and two very different conceptions of home. By the end of “Brooklyn” she is no longer who she was, even as she seems like someone we have always known.“Brooklyn” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some mild swearing and discreet but intense sexuality. Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes.",1,30459009.0,38219804.0,0

Stellan Skarsgard is Nils, a taciturn snowplow driver whose son dies in the movie’s opening moments. The authorities write off the death as a drug overdose, but Nils doesn’t think so, and he makes it his mission to find out who is responsible and administer justice.Soon he has ignited a turf war between rival drug gangs, one Serbian, the other homegrown, and the bodies start piling up. To help you keep track, the film counts the carnage, pausing for a sort of mock memoriam each time a thug dies.The director, Hans Petter Moland, brings flashes of “Fargo” and Quentin Tarantino to the telling, with disorienting camera angles and cryptic characters who say little and often don’t last long. The most cryptic character of all is Nils, and who better to play him than Mr. Skarsgard, whose work in the BBC One series “River” was so achingly good.Here, working with Mr. Moland, his frequent collaborator, he is reticent in a different way, bottling up rage more than regret. He’s the determined, humorless center around which a swirl of black comedy is deployed, topped off by a final flourish that ends this grim story on a ghoulish smile.",1,49284.0,,1

Darcy is at a crossroads: Applying for a belated bachelor’s degree, she may soon lose her job to budget cuts. Her son, Walker, committed suicide seven years earlier.Darcy soon learns that Mark (Shane Jacobsen), a friend of Walker’s, has grown wealthy after founding a chain of hot dog restaurants — Walker’s idea. Conspiring to confront Mark in New Orleans, she brings along her friend Byrd (Carrie Coon) and the gun Walker used to kill himself, probably more for symbolism than for proving Chekhov’s axiom.The journey is a pretext for healing, as Darcy visits an old friend (Glenne Headly, who died in June) and Walker’s father (Ted Ferguson), who abused her but is now ailing and mute. This gives Darcy a chance to unburden her thoughts to him while allowing Ms. Dieckmann, who wrote the screenplay, to avoid the complications of constructing a conversation.That’s the movie in a nutshell: A catharsis more meaningful for the character than for her audience.",0,,,1

Her arms are white and fashionably plump, her dress cream and splashed with gold. Her coronation robe, a massive ermine-and-red-velvet cloak, spills off her bared shoulders and onto the ground, creating a luxurious puddle. She looks a bit bored — heavy hangs the crown, or at least those opulent threads.This isn’t our familiar image of Victoria, the globular old lady shrouded in widow’s weeds and vehement melancholia, and wearing a dour look that suggests that she was never amused, not now, not ever. That woman, who became known as the Widow of Windsor after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, in 1861, is nowhere to be seen in “The Young Victoria,” a frivolously entertaining film, with Emily Blunt, about the young monarch. Ms. Blunt, who as Meryl Streep’s viperous assistant in “The Devil Wears Prada” slyly upstaged Anne Hathaway, doesn’t have Victoria’s padding or bearing, which is probably why she was cast in the role. No one wants to watch the lives and loves of the rich and dowdy.That at least seems to be the prevailing filmmaker wisdom, which is why what we usually get in movies about royal personages from dusty and distant worlds are sumptuous frocks, soaring music, a dash of intrigue and thunderous nonsense. “Young Victoria” — the latest in a long line of fictional entertainments about the dramatic, if more often than not melodramatic, ups and downs of female British monarchs — fits the bill nicely. There’s something about a queen that inspires filmmakers (audiences too), who enjoy pulling the curtain away from these most private lives and taking peeks under the royal robes. Because this queen spent so much of her life draped in black and gloom, her younger self would seem particularly ripe material.She is and she isn’t, at least here. Directed with some snap by Jean-Marc Vallée from a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, “The Young Victoria” opens with some turgid on-screen text about her birth in 1819: “A child is born.” No, not Jesus, but little Victoria, heir to the throne and the only daughter of the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and the unseen, soon-to-be-dead Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George III. But while she was born with a royal spoon in her mouth, little Victoria, like so many rich girls before and since, proves deeply unhappy. “What little girl does not dream of growing up as a princess,” Victoria asks early in dolorous voice-over, before lowering the boom: “Even a palace can be a prison.”A chill fills that palace’s rooms, a coldness largely emanating from the duchess and her close adviser, Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), who keep Victoria under lock and key to control her and the power she will assume. Isolated from other children, with only servants and a spaniel for company, Victoria amuses herself as best she can. Ms. Blunt tries her hardest to interest us as well, but there is limited entertainment in watching even an appealing actress wander forlornly, talking to herself and the dog. Victoria, it seems, wasn’t all that interesting at this stage in her life (or so it appears here), which might explain why Mr. Vallée tweaks his material to the point of exaggeration, sometimes to the point of parody, as with Mr. Strong’s virtual mustache-twirling.Happily, the story of young Victoria is also the tale of her relationship with her young consort, Albert (Rupert Friend, pretty and pink-cheeked), her first cousin. Born on the Continent, in part of what would become Germany, Albert enters Victoria’s life obliquely, first through the machinations of their uncle, King Leopold of Belgium (Thomas Kretschmann), and then during tentative visits. There’s a political dimension to Leopold’s matchmaking, but those details are immaterial to the romance that develops and deepens. Despite the filmmakers’ efforts to persuade us that “The Young Victoria” is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the movie’s pleasures are as light as its story. No matter. Albert may never rip Victoria’s bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours.“The Young Victoria” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

O. SCOTT,Headbanging After Therapy,"The last time I saw them in my professional capacity as a film critic, the members of Metallica were in therapy, working out their issues in the fascinating documentary “Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.” Nearly 10 years later, they seem to be doing well. “Metallica Through the Never,” a new concert film directed by Nimrod Antal (“Kontroll,” “Predators”), shows the band — three decades after the release of its first album — in vigorous middle age. Lars Ulrich, the drummer, is still a kinetic master of tricky time signatures, and his partner, the singer James Hetfield, bellows with undiminished authority. The fans, chanting along and giving devil-horn salutes, are as passionate as ever.Shot in 3-D and released on Imax screens, “Through the Never” aims for total metal immersion. Publicists at the press screening were handing out earplugs along with 3-D glasses, but I kept mine in my pocket for the authentic headbanging experience. Which was, frankly, not quite as intense as it might have been. Metallica, which alchemizes amorphous adolescent discontent into grandiose, technically dazzling nuggets of sound, is best experienced in the ecstatic collectivity of a concert or the throbbing privacy of your own head. Despite swooping camera movements and elaborate stagecraft, the film produces detachment rather than immediacy. And a too-literal subplot about a young roadie (Dane DeHaan) on a mysterious quest through the streets of a riot-torn city is even more alienating. It has the clumsy, earnest feel of fan fiction, or even parody. On the other hand, “Enter Sandman” is still a great song, and the band kills it.“Metallica Through the Never” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Having scored with his 2009 breakout monster flick, “Zombieland,” Mr. Fleischer will next take on “ The Gangster Squad,” about Los Angeles detectives up against East Coast mobsters in the 1940s. Here’s hoping that the rest of the brain trust behind “30 Minutes or Less” will be wreaking havoc elsewhere.Written by Michael Diliberti from a story he coughed up with Matthew Sullivan, the movie turns on Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), a pizza delivery guy who’s taken hostage, armed with a bomb vest and forced to rob a bank by a pair of chuckleheads, Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). Although Mr. Eisenberg radiates natural intelligence even when his motor mouth is running on empty dialogue, his character is a grade-A moron. Instead of going to the police or anyone with half a brain, he taps his belligerent closest friend, Chet (Aziz Ansari), for support, mostly because the simple, schematic script dictates that, like Dwayne, Nick needs a sidekick for his dumb and dumber routine.Dwayne, an overage slacker who scarcely seems housebroken, lives with his father, an ex-Marine called the Major (Fred Ward), in a McMansion in Grand Rapids, Mich. Dwayne spends all his time with his dimwit foil, Travis, a mustachioed pet rock with a skill set that involves flamethrowers. One day Dwayne decides to hire a contract killer to secure his premature inheritance after a close encounter with a pair of naked breasts. These belong to Juicy (Bianca Kajlich), a stripper who, while parked on Dwayne’s lap, takes off her top and starts fondling herself. As Dwayne stares at the gyrating mammaries, he begins chattering about his father’s dough, inspiring her to suggest that he kill the Major.It would be nice to believe that the filmmakers were connecting Dwayne’s aggressive infantilism to his gaga (goo-goo) response to the breasts and his murderous Oedipal impulses. But sometimes a woman who’s been directed to take her top off in a movie is just another exploited actress. And sometimes a rude and crude comedy is simply scraping the bottom of the barrel, despite the efforts of a talent like Mr. Eisenberg and of second bananas like Mr. Ansari and Mr. Swardson. Mr. McBride, on the other hand, is fast wearing out his welcome with a character type who, with a deep-fried accent and a pudd’nhead, could be called the cretinous cracker. It’s a shtick that helps makes the title of “30 Minutes or Less” sound like a cruel promise.If you tune out the dialogue, which is packed with raunch that has neither rhyme nor story reason, there are passable moments. The interludes of Nick shifting gears as he tries to beat the clock on another pizza run are nicely managed and say something about a character whose talent behind the wheel is a kind of grace note. Far less interesting are the parallel scenes of Dwayne and Travis conspiring in their little world and those with Nick and Chet swinging at each other in theirs. As one of the few women aboard, Dilshad Vadsaria provides the usual narrative and decorative female function as Nick’s romantic interest, while the always welcome Michael Peña, as a tattooed killer, almost subverts yet another deployed cliché.“30 Minutes or Less” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

502,2009-12-02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:10,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Ancient Inuit Wisdom as Sustenance in Dire Times,"“Before Tomorrow” is set in 1840 at the perilous moment when white explorers with their strange customs and implements began encroaching on the far north territory occupied by Inuit tribes that had little or no contact with the outside world. This visually transfixing movie is the third in  a trilogy that began with the ancient Inuit folk tale “The Fast Runner” (“Atanarjuat”) and continued with “The Journals of Knud Rasmussen,” set in the early 1920s.Directed by Marie-Hélène Cousineau and Madeline Piujuq Ivalu and based on a novel by the Danish writer Jorn Riel, the movie is a product of Arnait Video Productions, the Women’s Video Workshop of Igloolik. It is the only film in this series to focus on women’s roles as storytellers and repositories of folk wisdom; its perspective might be described as Inuit feminist.The film’s benign, nurturing ethos is accentuated by the contribution of the French-Canadian singer-songwriters Kate and Anna McGarrigle, whose searching folk ballad “Why Must We Die?” bookends the film. The lyrics, which begin, “We are meat, we are spirit/We have blood and we have grace,” evoke an ideal balance of flesh and spirit within a culture in harmony with nature in which the living seek counsel from the dead. Although it is one of the McGarrigles’ finest songs, the imposition of a contemporary folk ballad still doesn’t quite mesh with the film’s portrayal of an insular, in some ways prehistoric culture that even as late as 1840 had changed little over many centuries.Where “The Fast Runner,” the most powerful film of the trilogy, told a tough tale of dissension within a tribe, “Before Tomorrow” succumbs to ethnographic sentimentality in its idyllic depiction of the same world threatened by evil from outside. It tells the story of Ningiuq (Ms. Piujuq Ivalu), a wise old woman, who, with her lifetime friend Kutuujuk (Mary Qulitalik) and 10-year-old grandson, Maniq (Paul-Dylan Ivalu), is transported by kayak to a remote island to spend the final weeks of a bountiful summer drying salmon and caribou meat for the coming winter.Tales have already circulated within the community about white strangers who have a taste for a fiery liquid that makes them dance and then fall down and who carry  sharp sewing needles and wield knives made from a hard substance. Ningiuq is intuitively suspicious of possible contamination from strangers.The bond between Ningiuq and Maniq deepens after Kutuujuk dies of old age. Maniq gathers berries, develops his skills harpooning fish and catches his first seal, and Ningiuq tells him wondrous allegorical stories. When Maniq’s father fails to pick them up for the return voyage before the winter freeze, they make their way back to the community and find the entire population dead from smallpox.Thus begins the struggle of an increasingly fragile woman and a boy on the verge of adolescence to survive the frigid desolation of an Arctic winter. They find refuge in a cave, where they huddle together under seal skins beside a tiny, flickering oil fire and subsist on their cache of dried fish and meat. Ningiuq regales her grandson with tribal folk tales and the promise of a better place to go when the winter eases. An attack by wolves, during which Ningiuq is bitten on the shoulder and neck, leaves her weakened.“Before Tomorrow” makes awkward narrative leaps, and leaves much unexplained. Once the pair are in the cave, we see little of the grueling rituals of their daily struggle. Only once does Maniq complain of the cold.“Before Tomorrow” is frustratingly sketchy partly because it is not finally  a survival tale but a mystical evocation of the power of Inuit mythology, and how the passing down of ancient wisdom can sustain the human spirit in the direst circumstances. But the unanswered questions still nag.BEFORE TOMORROWOpens on Wednesday  in Manhattan.Directed by Marie-Hélène Cousineau and Madeline Piujuq Ivalu; written by Ms. Cousineau, Ms. Piujuq Ivalu and Susan Avingaq, based on the novel “For Morgendagen” by Jorn Riel; directors of photography, Norman Cohn and Félix Lajeunesse; edited by Mr. Cohn, Ms. Cousineau, Mr. Lajeunesse and Louise Dugal; music by Kate and Anna McGarrigle; production designer, Ms. Avingaq; produced by Zacharias Kunuk, Mr. Cohn and Stéphane Rituit; released by Igloolik Isuma Productions.

As Ms. Clarke and her sometime companion, Carl Lee, steer the conversation from off-camera, the material turns darker, to the police and to Mr. Holliday’s difficult childhood.Courting questions about the ethics of the camera and the nature of Mr. Holliday’s performance, “Portrait of Jason” is already a movie about its own making.Nevertheless, “Jason and Shirley,” a work of speculative fiction from Stephen Winter, reimagines the shooting of “Portrait of Jason” in December 1966. (“Once upon a time in the Chelsea Hotel,” as the title cards so cheekily put it.) It takes a disturbing, ambiguous film and reduces it to the comforting expository contours of a biopic.For those unfamiliar with Ms. Clarke, the movie’s fictionalized Shirley (Sarah Schulman, who wrote the script with Mr. Winter and her co-star, Jack Waters) quickly name-drops fellow experimental filmmakers. Yet even the history in Mr. Winter’s movie can’t be trusted: Although Ms. Clarke, who died in 1997, directed the Academy Award-winning “Robert Frost: A Lover’s Quarrel With the World,” the producer, Robert Hughes, took the award, contrary to what Mr. Winter’s film implies.When Jason (Mr. Waters) arrives, Mr. Winter’s movie weighs in on what it sees as the vampirism of Ms. Clarke’s methods. “Jason is doing everything that we want him to do,” the character Shirley tells a crew member (Eamon Fahey). “But don’t let him know.” The most novel aspect of “Jason and Shirley” is its use of VHS, likely a nod to Ms. Clarke’s advocacy for video as an artistic medium.Flashbacks and fantasy sequences undercut the claustrophobic atmosphere.

Then He Had to Endure the Spotlight.,"Clint Eastwood’s latest movie, “Sully,” is about a man who is excellent at his job. Specifically, it tells the story of Capt. Chesley Sullenberger and how, on a frigid January afternoon in 2009, he came to land a plane on the Hudson River. The movie is economical and solid, and generally low-key when it’s not freaking you out. That it unnerves you as much as it does may seem surprising, given that going in, we know how this story ends. But Mr. Eastwood is also very good at his job, a talent that gives the movie its tension along with an autobiographical sheen.It seems improbable that an entire movie could be built on the minutes from US Airways Flight 1549’s takeoff to the instant it flew into a flock of Canada geese that was sucked into both engines (“ingested,” in aviation parlance), leading to an almost complete loss of thrust, and its miracle landing. But movie time can be magical in how it bends reality, rather like plane travel, though much depends on how filmmakers play with space-time, freezing events, sliding into the past, only to jump back to the now, as Mr. Eastwood fluidly does. Here, a few minutes open one man’s life, revealing layers of consciousness that, in turn, lay bare that life’s moral center.The story largely involves what happens after Sully (Tom Hanks), his crew and his passengers were plucked from the river, specifically the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The investigators, a panel of long-faced, mostly male judges, poke and prod at Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (a sturdy Aaron Eckhart), forcing them to defend ditching the plane into the Hudson. Framed as a series of face-offs, the inquiry registers as more testy than adversarial, and the casting of comfortably familiar character actors — Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan and the affable-looking Mike O’Malley — implies that these sleuths aren’t inquisitors, just rolling up their sleeves to get right to work.The tension ebbs and flows as the story shifts among moments in time and states of consciousness. There are blah generic scenes with Sully’s worried wife (Laura Linney) and glimpses of his past (he learned to fly as a teenager); mostly, there is the friction that Mr. Eastwood generates from the investigation, the accident and Sully’s imaginary variations on the same. Mr. Eastwood bluntly drops in these imaginings, so it’s not always immediately clear whether you’re watching a fantasy, a strategy that intensifies their power. These illusions are manifestations of Sully’s worst, otherwise mostly unarticulated, fears, like disaster flicks dredged from his depths. And because we’re the only ones who see them, we become his secret sharer, or maybe confessor, which amplifies the movie’s intimacy.Mr. Hanks slips into Sully easily, with a grandfatherly wreath of white hair, a tidy mustache and an air of steadfast, professional calm that’s only occasionally beaded in sweat. It’s hard to imagine anyone else in the role, except perhaps for an older Matt Damon, another actor who conveys the old-fashioned, stoic heroism that movie companies have been outsourcing to Australian actors for years. So many younger actors read as slier than Mr. Hanks, whose appeal has always been that he seems like an awfully nice guy. It takes talent to persuade a mass audience that you’re decency incarnate, but Mr. Hanks goes one better by making decency into something like soul.You spend a lot of time staring at Mr. Hanks’s face, which, when watched in IMAX, looms as large as an Easter Island colossus. Mr. Eastwood, working with his longtime director of photography Tom Stern, shot most of “Sully” using large-format digital cameras, and so everything on a really big screen is really big, Mr. Hanks’s head included. At first, this bigness seems off-kilter, even distracting, perhaps because immensity in movies tends to serve visual spectacle. Here, Sully’s face is a landscape as vast as a western tableau, full of mystery and, over time, a means for the story’s radical subjectivity.Mr. Eastwood’s filmmaking is expedient (no fuss, no muss), detailed and distinguished by sudden beauty, as when Sully, after the accident, stands alone while framed against the wintry lead-gray sky out of which he just fell. Mr. Eastwood is a musician, and he plays with the story’s competing moods and rhythms with suppleness, setting one scene to the steady beat of everyday life, only to amp another until it races like a thudding heart. The accident, which remains unnervingly in the register of the real, is a master class in direction, as the reassuring engine hum gives way to a spooky near-silence that’s soon punctured by gasps, cries and terrifying shouts: “Brace, brace! Heads down, stay down!”“Sully” is a portrait of a hero — Mr. Sullenberger’s decision to land the plane on the Hudson helped save 155 lives, his own included — but one who, after the accident, is troubled both by what might have been (death, destruction) and by an unassuming man’s discomfort with the spotlight. Sully isn’t cut along the cynically frayed lines of assorted current screen heroes, with their nihilism lite and butchery, nor does he fit the existential mode, the man in revolt, like Jason Bourne. Sully is hewed from more classical stuff; he’s the hero whose dignity, as Lionel Trilling wrote, “is wholly manifest in word and deed, in physique and comportment.” Yet Sully is also very much alone, separated by ability and character, as well as by all the directorial choices that isolate him.Heroism has long been one of Mr. Eastwood’s themes as an actor and a director, though his portraits tend to be complicated by an annihilating violence often unthinkable in the classical Hollywood days. Draped in black, as if swathed in mourning crepe, some of his most memorable later movies explore the tragic consequences of violence, which runs through communities and individuals alike. They’re profoundly, sometimes uncomfortably, American testaments. By contrast, there’s no tragedy in “Sully,” just sighs of relief, probing questions and an outwardly uncomplicated hero whose extraordinariness is so deeply imbued that it is finally the most ordinary thing about him. You might think that Mr. Eastwood had mellowed, but the very singularity of this movie’s hero suggests otherwise.“Sully” is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned). If you’re afraid of flying, consider yourself warned. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes.",1,125065700.0,125070033.0,0

She has made an engrossing, dynamically shot movie that moves with real fluidity and complexity. Yet she also succumbs to familiar ideological pitfalls. The standard complaints about cultural appropriation, point of view and the ethics of aestheticizing war all apply.The movie’s source is Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir of her childhood under the Khmer Rouge, which captured Phnom Penh when she was 5 and ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Ms. Jolie announces her respect for the material almost immediately by putting the titles in Khmer as well as in English, only to undercut that gesture with a slick, scene-setting montage, glibly scored to the Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil.” The sequence juxtaposes footage of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and others with imagery of the United States’ bombing raids in Cambodia.Still, the stab at an energetic overture isn’t totally unwelcome, since the previous war movies Ms. Jolie directed — “In the Land of Blood and Honey” (2011) and “Unbroken” (2014) — were both earnest slogs. “First They Killed My Father” is never that.The story proper begins in Phnom Penh, where the young Loung (Sreymoch Sareum) lives comfortably with her middle-class family, which is loyal to the outgoing government. Her father (Kompheak Phoeung) is a captain in the military police. A moment in which Loung reaches for the sky, trying to touch a helicopter overhead, recalls Steven Spielberg’s “Empire of the Sun,” a movie that, with its child’s-eye view of war as a time of horror and wonder, might well have served as a template.The screenplay — Ms. Jolie and Ms. Ung are credited as a writing team — manages the tricky task of providing enough information to push the film along while only rarely straying beyond what a child might comprehend. Loung soon discovers that she and her family, with whom she’s been forced to evacuate the capital, won’t be returning home after the promised three days. She learns that she will work in service of Angkar (the name for the Khmer Rouge leadership); surrender personal property (foreign goods, in particular, are seen as symbols of an imperialist agenda); and be separated piecemeal from her parents and siblings.Ms. Jolie sparked an outcry for a casting process that, as recounted in a Vanity Fair interview, struck many as exploitative. The article said that Ms. Jolie was looking for children who had experienced hardship, and that for the lead role, the casting directors created a game in which children would steal money off a table and then lie when caught. (Ms. Jolie said her quotations were taken out of context; Vanity Fair stood by the story.) Whatever her process, she has found an expressive star in Ms. Sareum, who carries much of the film without words.Whether the movie’s perspective is truly Loung’s is another matter. Ms. Jolie, working with the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, shoots the character’s dream sequences in garish, supersaturated colors. The elaborate Steadicam shots and pervasive images of light streaming through foliage seem incongruously punch-drunk for a film that concerns mass starvation and death. Even a moment in which children training to fight stand completely still in a murky river during a downpour seems conceived more for its compositional possibilities than dramatic effect. Viewers familiar with the work of one of the producers, Rithy Panh, a director who has made movies about his own youth under the Khmer Rouge (including “The Missing Picture”), may find the rampant prettification poorly considered.The most simultaneously stunning and appalling shot shows a high-angle view of Loung treading carefully through a mine-strewn forest as another woman runs through it — only to step on a mine and be killed. The moment captures everything that’s right and wrong with “First They Killed My Father”: It is gorgeous and suspenseful, and it rushes heedlessly into dangerous terrain.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,"Review: From Natalie Portman, Israel’s Birth Distilled in Mood and Memory","“A Tale of Love and Darkness,” Natalie Portman’s directing debut, addresses a hugely complicated and consequential moment in 20th-century history: the founding of the state of Israel. There is no simple way to tell the story, and Ms. Portman’s film, closely based on a memoir by the Israeli novelist Amos Oz, is full of mixed emotions and chronological tangles. But despite the geopolitical momentousness — and present-day potency — of its concerns, it’s an elegant and intimate movie, a thing of nostalgic whispers and sighs rather than polemical slogans and shouts.In more ways than one, it’s also an intensely literary film, preoccupied with language — Hebrew, which Ms. Portman speaks fluently — and preferring nuances of mood and memory to details of plot. Before he was the acclaimed writer Amos Oz, the narrator and protagonist was Amos Klausner, born in Jerusalem in 1939 to parents who had escaped the accelerating horror of Europe. In the years following the climax of that horror, family members find themselves caught up in the conflict, confusion and excitement leading to the end of the British mandate and Israel’s war of independence.Torn between pride and skepticism, idealism and disappointment, they are at once actors in a sweeping international story and guinea pigs in a risky political experiment. Amos (Amir Tessler) is an alert and watchful child, and the entwined dramas of Zionism and his parents’ marriage are filtered through his quizzical consciousness.Amos’s mother, Fania (Ms. Portman), is bookish and melancholy, haunted (at least in her son’s recollection) by memories of her home in Ukraine and plagued by headaches and other ailments. The boy’s interpretation of his mother’s condition — offered by his older self (Moni Moshonov), who serves less as narrator than interpreter of his childhood — is that her romantic European temperament was unsuited to the hard realities of the Middle Eastern desert. The world she left behind is imagined as a lush, shadowed, fairy-tale environment, a stark contrast to the dry, sun-bleached reality of a fledgling modern nation. Her death, announced at the outset, is the film’s central obsessive, unsolvable mystery.Fania’s childhood image of Israel was of a muscular pioneer (Tomer Kapon) — a soldier or a farmer, depending on the particular fantasy. She ended up instead with a Lithuanian-born literary critic, Arieh (Gilad Kahana), whose nerdiness verges on caricature. “You’ll be bullied in school,” he tells his son. “But not because you’re Jewish.” And for him, that’s the essence of Zionism: not redemption or perfection, but normalcy.What happens to Fania — again, as her son understands it — is an implicit critique of that idea. One theme of “A Tale of Love and Darkness” is that a dream come true is inevitably a disappointment, a notion that seems to allude to one of the foundational mottos of Zionism. “If you will it, it is no dream,” Theodor Herzl, an architect of modern Zionism, said, but Fania suffers precisely from an atrophy of will and an inability to dream.That, at least, is the literary and ideological diagnosis that Ms. Portman teases out of the pages of Mr. Oz’s dense and sprawling book. On a more literal biographical level, Fania suffers from a psychological malaise exacerbated by the condescension of her in-laws (Arieh’s mother remarks that Fania’s borscht is “almost flavorful”) and her own mother’s cruelty. She suffers, perhaps a little too beautifully, like a heroine of melodrama. But that is partly how her son remembers her.There are many lovely and memorable moments in this film, which is in every way the opposite of a vanity project. If anything, Ms. Portman seems constrained by her own modesty, by a justified but nonetheless limiting reverence for her source material.“A Tale of Love and Darkness,” a conscientious adaptation of a difficult book, breathes a little more freely when it leaves the claustrophobia of the Klausner household and allows young Amos to confront the world outside his parents’ shadow. At those moments, often when Ms. Portman herself is offscreen, her directing also feels more open and self-confident, and you understand that in telling the story of how Mr. Oz developed his voice she has gone some distance toward discovering her own.“A Tale of Love and Darkness” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Love and darkness. It is in Hebrew, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes.",0,569381.0,572212.0,1

O. SCOTT,The Man in the Iron Irony,"“Iron Man 2,” the first superhero sequel of the summer, fulfills the basic requirements of the genre, which can be summed up as more of the same, with emphasis on more. Having introduced its physically and intellectually gifted, emotionally tormented protagonist in both his regular and alter egos, a comic book franchise will typically set out, in the second installment, in search of new villains, bigger suits, brighter gadgets and tendrils of plot that can blossom in subsequent sequels.But sometimes — for instance in the recent Spider-Man, X-Men and Batman cycles —  the second time is a charm, as filmmakers and actors use the reasonable certainty of financial success to take chances and explore odd corners of their archetypal, juvenile stories. “Iron Man 2,” directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by Justin Theroux, doesn’t achieve the emotional complexity of “Spider-Man 2” or the operatic grandeur of “The Dark Knight,” but it does try something a little bit new and perhaps, given the solemnity that has overtaken so much comic-book-based filmed entertainment, a little bit risky. It’s funny.Mr. Favreau and Mr. Theroux are both accomplished actors — in “Iron Man 2” Mr. Favreau again plays Iron Man’s nebbishy gopher — and they have in effect turned this movie over to its game and talented cast. It’s not that the action sequences are badly executed; they just aren’t very interesting. The suits and explosions and C.G.I. flight simulations may have cost a lot of money, but more imagination has been invested in the film’s sleek and shiny look and, above all, in its jittery, loquacious and eccentric population of geniuses, frauds, playboys and bad guys.At the head of this crew — and playfully keeping everyone guessing as to just which of those categories he fits into — is Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark. Stark has the identity issues and daddy problems that come with the superhero territory, but self-pity is as alien to him as false modesty. An apostle of pleasure, progress and the free market, he is the kind of devil-may-care, lady-killing capitalist demigod that just about every hedge-fund cowboy and high-tech guru of the past 10 years has dreamed of being. And he cares too: about world peace and race cars and scientific innovation, among other things.Mr. Downey, his restless features keeping Stark’s lounge-lizard facial hair in a state of perpetual animation, has a way of turning action-hero duty into a form of intellectual comedy. As fast as his body and mouth might move, his brain is even quicker. He has the rare and marvelous capacity to surprise himself, which is one reason, even in a noisy dud like “Sherlock Holmes,” you can’t stop watching him.But though Tony is a narcissist — he admits as much when a psychological profile tells him so — Mr. Downey is happy to share attention with any actor possessing the nerve and verve to try and keep up with him.Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, Stark’s right-hand woman, informal nanny and unacknowledged love interest, handles the rematch with even more exasperated aplomb than the first time out. Every encounter between these two is a flurry of interruptions, miscommunications, false starts and premature conclusions. At a time when romantic comedy has abandoned its tradition of witty dialogue in favor of either simpering or crudity, apparently it falls to a comic book spectacle to keep the screwball tradition alive.In addition to his Girl Friday, Stark also has a nemesis, a sidekick (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard) and a designated heel. The heel is a rival armaments mogul named Justin Hammer, played with a sublime mixture of pomposity and cluelessness by Sam Rockwell. Hammer is Daffy Duck to Stark’s Bugs Bunny, forever trying to outdo his competitor and discovering new registers of pique and humiliation every time he falls short.Which would make Mickey Rourke’s Ivan Vanko — what, exactly? The Tasmanian Devil? Yosemite Sam? There is something of a physical resemblance to both, but Mr. Rourke composes a fugue of malevolence in his own demented key. Vanko, like Stark the son of a military scientist, is what his lucky enemy might have been if the cold war had gone the other way. His body covered with Russian prison tattoos, his face a fleshy mask of bitter pride, Mr. Rourke takes possession of the movie every time he shows up. In his first few seconds on screen he speaks Russian and plies a cockatoo with vodka. Later he dons a high-tech supervillain suit complete with fiber-optic whips and a breastplate like Iron Man’s, but none of that can match the silky menace of his line readings.There are, I suppose, viewers who will regard the comic filigree of “Iron Man 2” — and I haven’t even mentioned Clark Gregg’s deadpan secret agent or Garry Shandling’s bloated senator — as diverting or distracting filler deposited between action sequences and plot revelations. I take the opposite view. A bunch of guys in metal suits slugging it out in a park in Queens? I can probably find that on pay-per-view or even YouTube. And the plot of “Iron Man 2” is frankly a bit of a hash, as Stark’s two-front conflict with Hammer and Vanko competes with exposition that will only pay off (meagerly, I suspect) in later sequels.Such preparation is one reason that Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson show up here, though there are of course others. Mr. Jackson looks good in an eye patch, as Ms. Johansson does in tight skirts and tighter body suits. So you might say that the movie has something for everyone, which is fine but also, in the end, not quite enough. You’re left wanting more, but not quite the “more” “Iron Man 2” works so hard to supply.“Iron Man 2” is rated PG-13. It has swearing, mayhem, discreet bloodshed and sexual innuendo.IRON MAN 2Opens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Jon Favreau; written by Justin Theroux,; director of photography, Matthew Libatique; edited by Richard Pearson and Dan Lebental; music by John Debney; production designer, J.

Who hasn’t, at a certain point in life, faced a sink-or-swim moment when a promising future suddenly began to seem out of reach? James combats the terror of grown-up responsibility with copious amounts of booze and late-night carousing in which he picks fights in bars and behaves like a brat. But Mr. Abbott’s performance makes you aware that James’s bad behavior stems from fear; deep down he has a warm heart.The opening scene observes James in a daze amid the deafening clamor of an after-hours club. Plunging into the harsh morning light, he takes a taxi to the Upper West Side apartment of his mother, Gail (Cynthia Nixon), where guests are observing the Jewish custom of sitting shiva for his dead father. Barging into the gathering like a rowdy party guest, he is conspicuously rude and boorish.A latter-day slacker with vague writing ambitions, James sleeps on a couch in Gail’s apartment, where he is her fly-by-night caretaker. As the story begins, she is being treated for Stage 4 cancer. There is talk of his getting a job at New York Magazine through a family connection, although it is obvious that he is in no condition to work. His best friend and wingman, Nick (Scott Mescudi a.k.a. Kid Cudi), tries to keep him in line, but to little avail.This feature directorial debut of Josh Mond, who also wrote this film and who produced “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” is an exquisitely acted portrait of Gail and James’s fraught bond. Gail, who loves her son unconditionally, gently prods him to find his own place and get a job. But even when she reprimands him, her tone is forgiving.Before James begins to face his uncertain future, he travels to Mexico, where he meets a young woman who accompanies him back to New York after news arrives that Gail has taken a turn for the worse. The moment of truth has arrived.Ms. Nixon gives one of the year’s most heart-rending screen performances. James and Gail’s scenes evoke the most poignant moments of Margaret Edson’s play, “Wit,” whose 2012 revival starred Ms. Nixon as a dying cancer patient.Shot hand-held, “James White” conveys a compressed sense of time. Suddenly James is back in New York. Just as suddenly, he is holed up for a night in a luxury building. The movie’s refusal to explain James’s peripatetic ways lends it an extra edge of anxious frenzy. Its abrasive portrait of contemporary New York as a place of noise and nerve-rattling turmoil captures the mood of the city more accurately than any recent film I can think of. And the jagged camera work exacerbates the film’s jarring sense of immediacy.“James White” doesn’t soften its message: You can only avoid facing reality for so long, until it catches up with you. Then it grabs you by the throat.“James White” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for drug use, some nudity and language.

That is one truth in “One Lucky Elephant,” a sweet, heart- and trunk-tugging, modestly sized documentary — except for its 10,000-pound title subject — about a circus man and the wild animal he foolishly bought, helped to train, loved like a (captive) daughter and finally, tearfully, tried to do right by, mostly by letting her go.When David Balding met Flora, the African elephant at the center of this drama and the former star of his St. Louis circus, she was a baby. Born in Zimbabwe in 1982, she was orphaned at 2, perhaps during what is called a culling, the polite word for the organized killing of animals for population control. As it sometimes is on the harder questions, the documentary tends to be frustratingly vague on Flora’s origins, though the Web site for Mr. Balding’s circus, circusflora.org, states that she was orphaned by ivory poachers. Whatever the case, he bought Flora when she was still shorter than he and before long had her trained to stand on her head and lie down for the one-ring circus he helped establish in 1987.By the time Flora was a teenager, Mr. Balding, realizing that she would probably outlive him — African elephants can live up to 70 years — decided that he needed to find her a new home, no easy task. In 2000 Flora performed for the last time, an event documented by the director Lisa Leeman. (The filmmakers learned about the retirement through Miriam Cutler, the documentary’s co-producer. Ms. Cutler is the resident composer for Circus Flora and wrote the bouncy, whimsical score, suggestive of the cafe-jazz sound of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra.) After immortalizing that final performance, the filmmakers kept shooting, tagging after Mr. Balding for the next decade during his long, difficult goodbye to Flora.Mr. Balding is as much an attraction in the movie as Flora, and only somewhat less charming. He’s a big bear of a man, fuzzy and round, with obvious health issues — as the movie goes on, he uses a cane, crutches, a wheelchair and a motorized cart to get around — and a sympathetic screen presence. His fondness for Flora registers as entirely real and deep, whether he’s shooing her away as he talks to the camera — her trunk undulating around his body, she appears to be trying to pick his pockets in one scene, presumably for treats — or taking their last bow under the big top. His regret over adopting this majestic animal feels equally sincere, and it’s his remorse, as much as the shots of Flora in action, that impresses.There’s no denying Mr. Balding’s love for Flora, which at times threatens to overwhelm the movie, flooding it with tears when clear-eyed thinking — and by someone other than Mr. Balding — would be better. “One Lucky Elephant” is on the side of Flora and her captured kind, but it also hedges. Using a weave of original visuals, including talking-head interviews, along with stock footage, television news clips and archival photographs, it is an engaging, if shallow, 84-minute-long story about a man trying to right a wrong that the movie itself doesn’t adequately explore. Ms. Leeman includes some images of the young Flora being trained, for instance, but because Mr. Balding does most of the talking (in voice-over he admits that one trainer’s methods were harsh), the cruelty of the elephant instruction feels soft-pedaled.Flora is loved but, pace the title, it’s a stretch to call her lucky. Intent on entertaining you no matter how disturbing the material, Ms. Leeman perhaps doesn’t see it that way, which may explain why the movie bogs down in its last third, as Mr. Balding bickers with the sanctuary where he placed Flora. Animal people sometimes say the wackiest things, but here, alas, they never satisfyingly address the ethical questions of what it means to capture and keep wild animals.

For the rest of this melancholic film by the Portuguese director João Pedro Rodrigues that image lingers as a mental double exposure with the visage of the movie’s protagonist, Tonia (Fernando Santos), a fading drag queen in 1980s Lisbon. The war paint and makeup worn by Tonia, who appears in various stages of drag, are both disguises.The man applying the camouflage, we later learn, is Tonia’s son, Zé Maria (Chandra Malatitch), from whom she has been alienated for years. He reappears in Tonia’s life, having gone AWOL after sodomizing and murdering the soldier he painted, whom he now dismisses as a “poofter.” The film’s unresolved paradoxes are even encapsulated by its title, suggestive of a macho war film, which “To Die Like a Man” most definitely is not.Shown in the 2009 New York Film Festival, “To Die Like a Man” changes back and forth from an unsentimental examination of an insular nightclub world to a surreal phantasmagoria sprinkled with enigmatic symbols. What does it mean when Zé Maria surreptitiously drops a gnawed chicken bone, a high-heeled shoe and a photograph into Tonia’s aquarium, which he later destroys?Tonia, compellingly embodied by Mr. Santos, is a stout, decidedly unpretty 20-year veteran of Lisbon’s drag clubs. Although we don’t see her perform onstage, the camera approvingly surveys her in her gaudy finery of pearl-studded blond wig, boas and glitter.We meet the club’s protective manager, Teixeira (Fernando Gomes); its young rising star, Jenny (Jenny Larrue), with whom Tonia is furiously competitive; and Tonia’s best friend, Irene (Cindy Scrash), with whom she also has a scrappy relationship.Tonia’s life revolves around the care and feeding of her beloved dog and her volatile boyfriend, Rosário (Alexander David), a scrawny, much younger heroin addict for whom she is as much a mother as a lover. Although Rosário is pressuring Tonia to complete the final stage of her sexual reassignment surgery, she resists, because to do so would clash with her devout Catholicism.Knowing that her shelf life as a drag performer is about to expire, Tonia also has a deepening awareness of the man inside the woman as the end of her career coincides with her body’s deterioration. Later in the movie it is revealed that she is terminally ill. (From AIDS? From silicone leaking out of breast implants? From cancer? We don’t know.) As her condition worsens, she is forced to remove the implants, a necessity that makes her tragically aware of living in a biological limbo.For all its melodrama “To Die Like a Man” is a not a tearjerker. Its gaze into the void is as unblinking as that of the H.I.V.-positive 60-year-old hustler in Jacques Nolot’s even more hard-headed film, “Before I Forget.” Both films refuse to soften the harsher personal truths faced by aging professional salesmen of erotic fantasy.With a running time of 133 minutes, “To Die Like a Man” is much longer than it needs to be, and at one point it drifts into reverie. When Tonia and Rosário go on a car trip that lands them in an enchanted forest where they meet a haughty, elegant drag queen (Gonçalo Ferreira de Almeida) who has withdrawn from the world, it is almost a different movie.For one seemingly endless moment the film stops in its tracks. The screen turns rose colored, and the characters, barely stirring, contemplate a song heard on the soundtrack as though they were gazing at a stage. You have the sense that they realize with a special insight the meaning of the expression life is but a dream.TO DIE LIKE A MANOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by João Pedro Rodrigues; written by Mr. Rodrigues and Rui Catalão; director of photography, Rui Poças aip; edited by Mr. Mourão and Mr. Rodrigues; production design by João Rui Guerra da Mata; costumes by Patrícia Dória; produced by Maria João  Sigalho; released by Strand Releasing.

512,2014-04-18,Small Time,"Christopher Meloni, Devon Bostick, Dean Norris, Bridget Moynahan",USA,Joel Surnow,Drama,English,54.0,104.0,Joel Surnow,2014,6.0,1181.0,57.0,2017-11-02 04:18:18,STEPHEN HOLDEN,A Chip Off the Old Engine Block,"In the deadly voice-over that begins Joel Surnow’s “Small Time,” a man declares: “This is the story about my father and the summer we spent together many years ago. It was the summer that changed my life.”Please, no, I groaned. I don’t know if I can stand under another male weepie about fathers and sons and a boy’s coming-of-age.Although what follows is exactly that, it’s not bad. “Small Time” is agreeably sentimental meat-and-potatoes fare with strong dashes of humor, executed with a sincerity that’s hard to resist. The voice-over belongs to Freddy (Devon Bostick), the brash 18-year-old son of Al Klein (Christopher Meloni), who, with his friend Ash (Dean Norris), owns Diamond Motors, a used-car dealership in Covina, Calif.The time is the indeterminate recent past, before smartphones and when soul music was popular. And Al, a straight-talking salt-of-the-earth type, is still hurting after a divorce from his beautiful upwardly mobile wife, Barbara (Bridget Moynahan). Barbara dumped him to marry Chick (Xander Berkeley), a rich venture capitalist for whom she worked while Al was struggling to build his business.Relative peace prevails, until Freddy suddenly announces that he would rather work for Diamond Motors selling cars than go to college, and that he wants to live with Al in a house Chick describes as “a shoe box in the valley.” Barbara, beside herself, warns Al, “If he ends up like you, I’ll hang myself.”Freddy moves in with Al, and, in the movie’s funniest scenes, he learns the ropes about car salesmanship. He proves to be an adept, funny fast talker and soon starts behaving like an obnoxious big shot. Al reluctantly takes action.At first, “Small Time” seems as if it’s going to be a polemic about class warfare that pits the hearty working class against the chilly, indifferent rich. But it proves to be an evenhanded serious comedy reflective of a more optimistic era. (Its first draft was written in 1976.) Mr. Meloni’s Al, the good dad incarnate, is a less hotheaded version of Elliot Stabler, his character on “Law & Order: SVU.” Mr. Norris’s Ash exhibits the same gruff heartiness as Hank, his character on “Breaking Bad.” Barbara softens, and Chick, although reserved, is far from icy. Mr. Bostick’s Freddy, for all his upstart behavior, is a good boy at heart.“Small Time” adds up to a refreshingly unpretentious, warmhearted made-for-television movie that thinks better of humanity than most movies nowadays.“Small Time” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual references.",0,,,0

SCOTT,Review: Jennifer Lawrence as a Modern-Day Cinderella in ‘Joy’,"On paper, David O. Russell’s new film, “Joy,” looks perfectly straightforward, even square. It’s a bootstrap-capitalist fable, a tale of adversity overcome and rags exchanged for riches, a case study in success suitable for a self-improvement seminar.But Mr. Russell likes to tell conventional stories in unconventional ways. In the chapter of his career that began with “The Fighter” (2010), he has emerged as something of a genre magician, able to make formulas and clichés disappear behind a smoke screen of artful misdirection. “Silver Linings Playbook” (2012) was an assembly-line romantic comedy tricked out with a wild paint job and a souped-up, custom-built engine. “American Hustle” (2013) was a caper movie blown up into a pop opera. “The Fighter” itself — the movie “Joy” most resembles — was a boxing picture with an irregular heartbeat and a wildly talented cast.Like Micky Ward, the striving pug played by Mark Wahlberg in that movie, Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself thwarted and undermined by her own family. In the film’s opening scenes, her various relations nearly erase her altogether, blocking Ms. Lawrence’s quiet incandescence with ugliness and noise. The divorced mother of two young children, Joy left college when her parents split up and now contends daily with a small army of needy narcissists. Her mother, Terry (Virginia Madsen), lies in bed all day watching a soap opera (a fake one that Mr. Russell has cast with real-life soap opera stars). Rudy (Robert De Niro), Terry’s ex-husband, acts like a helpless child when he’s single and like an entitled patriarch when there’s a woman in his life. Joy also has a passive-aggressive sister (Elisabeth Rohm) and an ex-husband of her own, who is living in her basement until his singing career takes off.All of this information is conveyed in Mr. Russell’s breathless, breakneck style. The camera never stops moving, the people never shut up, and the resulting buzz is both stimulating and enervating. There are a few bright spots and calm moments in Joy’s drab, frenetic life. Her grandmother, Mimi (Diane Ladd), believes in her (and provides benevolent voice-over narration). Joy’s ex, Tony (Édgar Ramírez), is actually a pretty nice guy and is able, like Amy Adams’s character in “The Fighter,” to be an ally against the familial back stabbers.Just when you begin to wonder where the movie is going — Toward domestic comedy? Second-chance romance? Lurid dysfunction? — Joy has an idea. Sketching with her children’s crayons, she invents a new kind of mop, the kind that can be wrung out without touching the head. (This household convenience really exists, and the character is very loosely based on its inventor and her career.) Flush with entrepreneurial zeal, Joy borrows money from her father’s new companion (a supremely haughty Isabella Rossellini), works out the patent and supply-chain issues, and prepares to revolutionize American floor cleaning.It’s not so easy, of course. And if “Joy” seems to move toward a foreordained conclusion, it zigzags and covers its tracks along the way, sending its heroine on a roller-coaster ride of raised hopes and brutal disappointments and playing tricks with the audience’s expectations. What kind of spark will ignite between Joy and Neil Walker, a big shot in the world of home-shopping cable television? Since he’s played by Bradley Cooper, the answer could be anything.But the movie, in all its mess and glory, belongs almost entirely to Ms. Lawrence. She is the kind of movie star who turns everyone else into a character actor. This is not a complaint but an acknowledgment of both her charisma and her generosity. The rest of the cast members have the freedom to be weird, awful and lovable in spite of themselves, to orbit eccentrically around her celestial presence. Mr. De Niro and Ms. Rossellini in particular seem to be having the time of their lives playing parental grotesques who might have wandered out of a Roald Dahl novel.And Mr. Russell gives this meat-and-potatoes parable of upward mobility, set in the early 1990s, a children’s-book quality. I don’t mean that the story is simplified, but rather that its magical, improbable and cruel elements are heavily underlined, so that Joy feels more like a princess laboring under a terrible spell than like a struggling working-class mother. The trolls, witches and ogres she must beguile and vanquish are, for the most part, her own kin. She is, like a fairy-tale hero or heroine, on a long and complicated quest, relying on spells and charms as well as her innate goodness to deliver her.It can be argued that Ms. Lawrence is miscast, that she’s too young, too glamorous, insufficiently dented by life’s hard knocks. It can also be argued: So what? Joy’s Cinderella qualities suit her perfectly, and she has the rare ability to combine radiance with realism. Like some of the great screen goddesses of old — for some reason, Lauren Bacall seems like the best point of comparison — she seems at once impossibly magnetic and completely down to earth, regal and democratic, ordinary and perfect.The movie struggles to keep up with her. Perfection does not lie within the scope of Mr. Russell’s chaotic methods, and “Joy” can wear you out even as it tries to lift you up. The pursuit of happiness is a lot of work.“Joy” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of messes to clean up. Running time: 2 hours 4 minutes.",0,42581369.0,56384928.0,1

More, it refused to confirm whether its malicious entity was imaginary or otherworldly, a question that bedevils Martin’s estranged stepsister, Rebecca (Teresa Palmer), when she becomes his protector. Recalling her own troubled childhood with the mentally unstable Sophie and her attachment to an invisible friend she called Diana, Rebecca needs no convincing when Martin tells her that Diana has returned.Using his 2013 micro-movie as a jumping-off point, the Swedish director David F. Sandberg extracts maximum frights from the simplest of conceits: Diana materializes in darkness and vanishes in light. Whipping up an eerie blend of haunted-house thriller and supernatural-stalker story, he proves less adept at managing Eric Heisserer’s overly detailed screenplay than at choreographing visual scares. In these, he is inventively abetted by Marc Spicer’s bird-dogging camera, which noses around closet doors and into cellar corners with shivery curiosity.Spackling over any copycat cracks with strong acting and fleet editing, “Lights Out” delivers minimalist frights in old-school ways. Chief among these are the chilling exertions of the stunt actress Alicia Vela-Bailey, a former gymnast who portrays Diana with limber ingenuity. Writhing in the shadows like a child’s charcoal nightmare, she imbues the spook with devilish intent. Whatever you do, don’t blink.

This feature debut of the writer and director Jérôme Reybaud opens with a baby-faced 30-something, Pierre (Pascal Cervo), training a phone flashlight on his lover Paul (Arthur Igual). He then leaves Paul’s Paris apartment and drives an Alfa Romeo into rural France. The fantasy of walking out on your life and aimlessly wandering around can beguile even the most contentedly domesticated among us.Pierre is also looking to quench a thirst. He regularly checks his Grindr app, and at a roadside restroom, scans the stall graffiti and calls a number advertising sex services. He also picks up people along the roadside, not for cruising purposes, but to be of help. The first is a middle-age woman who is booked to sing at a senior home. The characters encountered are a bit more colorful than the ones you are likely to come across in real life, but not so much that they seem overtly allegorical. As Pierre roams, Paul embarks on a quest of his own, traveling to the center of the country to look for his lover via concentric Grindr circles.Some of this story is mildly whimsical, and there are ramps into some kind of magical realism (a blizzard at the French-Italian border is a little far-fetched). There are a lot of shots from behind a car windshield. These are more allied with Vincent Gallo’s “The Brown Bunny” than with Monte Hellman’s more lyrical “Two-Lane Blacktop.” While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the “not for everybody” critical hedge.",0,,,1

The surprises and sight gags, however they are discharged, are more important than the actors and the direction.Casting is a matter of filling in blanks. Some comedians, when they slip on a banana peel, look more ridiculous than others. But it’s still a banana peel, and a pratfall is a pratfall. Making the whole creaky device run smoothly is mostly a matter of greasing the machinery.This slapdash remake of the 2007 film “Death at a Funeral” is a case in point. All it requires of the actors is the ability to carry off a hamminess that sustains a jolly comic tone. The original movie, directed by Frank Oz from a screenplay by Dean Craig, imagined the most embarrassing possible chain of comic horrors at a funeral attended by proper Britons.The wrong body is delivered to the home. The 4-foot-tall secret gay lover of the deceased appears with sexually explicit snapshots in hand and demands money. One nervous guest imbibes a powerful hallucinogen that he thinks is a tranquilizer, goes deliriously bonkers and ends up naked on the roof. A corpse noisily resurrects during the ceremony. There is obligatory scatology.The 2010 “Death at a Funeral,” directed by Neil LaBute, has been moved from England to a Los Angeles suburb, where the family and friends of a black middle-class patriarch gather to pay their final respects. Nothing is made of the cultural transition from stiff-upper-lip England to Southern California, or of the racial change to predominantly African-American, beyond references to R. Kelly and to the dead man’s being on the “down low.”Reining in his signature misanthropy, Mr. LaBute wisely avoids taking the Tyler Perry route of turning “Death at a Funeral” into a loud, knockabout carnival show. The acting, especially by Chris Rock, as Aaron, the older of two squabbling sons of the deceased, is restrained. But you sorely miss any traces of Mr. Rock’s mischievous glower as he plays it so straight that the role seems a waste of his talent.He leads a high-profile cast of mostly African-American actors, who include Martin Lawrence as Aaron’s smirkingly libidinous brother, Ryan, a successful writer of trash novels; Keith David as the impatient, avaricious preacher, the Reverend Davis; Loretta Devine as the dead man’s divalike widow who continually nags her daughter-in-law (Regina Hall) to produce a grandchild; and Danny Glover as the splenetic wheelchair-bound Uncle Russell.Tracy Morgan plays Norman, a hypochondriacal family friend who helps Uncle Russell into a bathroom in which an excremental explosion takes place; this surefire gag had the preview audience screaming.Among three white cast members, James Marsden as the blissed-out victim of pharmaceutical confusion, and Peter Dinklage as the dead man’s diminutive boyfriend, Frank (he played the same character with a different name in the original movie), get the most comic mileage from their turns. Luke Wilson, in a thankless role, is lost.Think of “Death at a Funeral” as a comic quickie. As it presses buttons, a few laughs come out, but that’s all there is to it.“Death at a Funeral” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scatological humor and male nudity.DEATH AT A FUNERALOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Neil LaBute; written by Dean Craig; director of photography, Rogier Stoffers; edited by Tracey Wadmore-Smith; music by Christophe Beck; production designer, Jon Gary Steele; costumes by Maya Lieberman; produced by Sidney Cimmel, William Horberg, Chris Rock, Share Stallings and Laurence Malkin; released by Screen Gems.

Hood vs. Evil,” another Weinstein Company bid to crack the overcrowded field of children’s digital animation. A successor to the lackluster “Hoodwinked!,” with a cast of formidable voice talents, the film takes fairy-tale characters — Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf, the Grandmother — and drops them into a comic web of fantastical espionage.Red (Hayden Panettiere), a member of the Shaolin-like order the Sisters of the Hood, is pressed into service by the top-secret Happily Ever After Agency when Granny (Glenn Close) is kidnapped by a witch (Joan Cusack) who has also imprisoned the seemingly innocent Hansel and Gretel (Bill Hader and Amy Poehler).

(It also offers perhaps the most barbed visual aside ever to come from the Weinstein brothers about their former corporate master, Disney.)The letdown with “Hoodwinked Too!” is the animation. The images don’t remotely approach the nuance of, say, “Ice Age,” let alone anything from the mack daddy, Pixar. And while it seems there’s no getting away from this marketing aesthetic, the resemblance at times to a video game is far, far too acute.

From the way that most people look at the inked, pierced form of Lisbeth Salander, the main attraction in the movie adaptation of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” the first book in Stieg Larsson’s so-called Millennium Trilogy, you might even think that our girl had a swastika stamped on her forehead rather than a few modest rings hooked through her nose — you know, like a cow ready for market or, given the murderous milieu, slaughter.Salander, as she’s usually called in the books, is a devil doll par excellence, and maybe if David Fincher makes good on the vaporous rumors wafting around about the inevitable American adaptation, she might one day make an equally delectable film character too. Weighing in at 90 pounds of rage on the page and a hair heavier and less fierce on the screen, where she’s played by Noomi Rapace, Salander embodies a host of au courant fantasies. She’s a geek girl for starters, a computer hacker who would have downloaded this flick before it even hit theaters, and whose fetish wear and shiny boots suggest that she’s into BDSM, as they say in bondage, discipline and sadomasochism circles.More seductive to some, Salander is also a victim turned avenger, who, rather than taking her traumatic past out on herself in classic female style, say, by cutting, externalizes her rage. She doesn’t take anything lying down, including sex and violence. She’s the top dog in bed as well as in the streets, where she follows the creed that it’s better to die on your feet than on your knees. From one angle, she looks like a consummate cool chick of the sort routinely conjured up by the science-fiction visionary William Gibson, whose dream girl in his novel “Pattern Recognition,” with her singular talents, black clothes and sleek, tousled “anime hair, rendered hi-rez,” could easily describe Salander.There’s more to Salander, however, than goth threads and ornamentation, and much of what makes  Mr. Larsson’s first book worth the long haul (almost 600 pages in paperback) are the revelations about her spiky, unsettling, satisfyingly not-nice personality, which her creator, who died before the trilogy’s publication, peels as deliberately as an onion. She’s a less disquieting presence in the movie (a protracted 152 minutes), which was competently, sometimes ploddingly directed by Niels Arden Oplev and written by Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel. Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that’s mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character. She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don’t let her fully play.Maybe they were too busy trying to get — and keep — Mr. Larsson’s heavily plotted story in gear. A journalist who crusaded against right-wing extremism, he crammed a fearsome amount — love, sex, historical traumas, even an iBook plug — into “Dragon Tattoo,” his first novel. As in the book, Salander shares narrative pride of place in the movie with a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist, adequate and sympathetic), who, after losing a highly publicized libel case to a corporate titan, is hired by a semi-retired captain of industry, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), an  octogenarian who wants to know how and why his favorite niece, Harriet, disappeared decades earlier. Vanger suspects one of his creepy-crawly relatives, some of whom were active Nazis during World War II.To retrofit “Dragon Tattoo” for the screen, the writers have ditched plot details and characters even as they’ve lifted crucial material from its sequel, “The Girl Who Played With Fire.” These incendiary visuals, borrowed from Salander’s childhood, make the glib case for why she’s such a head case. But the flashbacks are so visually and thematically blunt that they upstage the narrative’s interesting parallels and disturb its political undertow: Salander and Blomkvist initially occupy separate story lines that seem to converge only because she’s hired to spy on him. Along the way, each runs a gantlet of patriarchal violence (personal, social, capitalist), a trail of horrors that ends in a pile of bodies. Each is also a victim of that violence, which gives the story a political edge, keeping it from pure psychodrama.“The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” was originally published as “Men Who Hate Women,” which apparently wasn’t sexy enough for English-language bookshelves. The title change certainly spices things up, no matter how commonplace body art is,  at least outside of Stockholm, and it   plays down its overarching theme, which the movie only does further. Just as significant is the substitution in the title of “girl” for “women,” a categorical displacement (and diminution) that also shifts the emphasis from the crime (and criminals) and places it on Salander’s slender back.It’s an attractive back in the movie, as is the tattoo adorning it, even if, like all the prettily photographed winter landscapes, the dragon covers up something the filmmakers seem loath to reveal and simultaneously eager to exploit.THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOOOpens on Friday  in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington.Directed by Niels Arden Oplev; written by Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel, based on the novel by Stieg Larsson; director of photography, Eric Kress; edited by Anne Osterud and Jannus Billeskov Jansen; music by Jacob Groth; production designer, Niels Sejer; costumes by Cilla Rorby; produced by Soren Staermose; released by Music Box Films.

There are oceans already sloshing through “In the Heart of the Sea,” the latest from the director Ron Howard, about the shipwreck that was an inspiration for Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick.” Epic in ambition, it spans decades and miles as it moves from Nantucket to a Pacific whale hunt that pits man (Chris Hemsworth) against Leviathan. It’s at once a biopic and an adventure yarn that, with harpoons and ploddingly good intentions, turns a story of survival into an ecological cautionary tale.Mixing fact and fiction, the movie pulls a thread from history and tries to weave it into a tapestry. On a Nantucket night in 1850, Herman (a wan Ben Whishaw) blusters into the home of an old seaman, Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson), who has a story but is in emotional lockdown. Making his case with cash, Herman persuades Tom to talk, which he does with booze and much actorly harrumphing from Mr. Gleeson. Winding the clock back to 1819, Tom begins the story of the whaling ship, the Essex, and its first mate, Owen Chase, a role that once would have belonged to Burt Lancaster and which Mr. Hemsworth plays with a straight-edged seriousness that is among the movie’s virtues.The film is based on Nathaniel Philbrick’s 2000 nonfiction best seller, “In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex.” Among Mr. Philbrick’s sources are Nickerson’s posthumously published account, “The Loss of the Ship ‘Essex’ Sunk by a Whale and the Ordeal of the Crew in Open Boats,” and Chase’s 1821 book, which has an even more charmingly prolix title: “Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex, of Nantucket; Which Was Attacked and Finally Destroyed by a Large Spermaceti-Whale, in the Pacific Ocean; With an Account of the Unparalleled Sufferings of the Captain and Crew” and so on. That more or less tips what happens in the movie, with the sufferings regularly interrupted by scenes of Herman’s writing and Tom’s talking.Directors tend to have a tough time making the act of writing pop visually, and the pleasant scratching sound of a quill on paper only goes so far. So it’s understandable that Mr. Howard, who’s best when he’s in touch with his B-movie pulp side, seems as anxious as Owen to set sail. First though there’s the typical scene-setting, including some dutiful domestic drama with Owen’s loving yet resentful wife (Charlotte Riley, in a placeholder role), which Mr. Howard and company try to enliven with sincere looks, earnest promises and panoramic views of the unconvincingly antiqued island. More promising are Owen’s exchanges with his employer, a shipping company that forces him to serve under George Pollard (Benjamin Walker), an inexperienced captain with family connections.Owen’s dealings with the shipping company introduce some hefty topics — capitalism, nepotism, corruption, democracy — that vibrate throughout the story without ever developing into an argument. That’s too bad, but as the movie lurches along by fits and starts, toggling between the little Nantucket room and the great watery world, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have no idea how to reconcile not just two parallel stories but also the past and our contemporary age. In one corner there’s the ambitious author hungrily absorbing a tragic tale that will help lead him to a masterpiece; in the other is the old-fashioned adventure story outfitted with manly action, churning waters and a catastrophe in the wild that meant something very different in the 19th century than it does today.Mr. Howard goes all out when the ship finally sets sail: The camera whips around, going wide and eye-jabbingly close as you follow the crew up the masts, across the deck and into the galley. He comes across as keenly interested in the sweat labor it takes to run a whaling ship (the industrial organization evokes that of a major production like this one), but shortly after touring the operations, the movie loses momentum. One problem is the obvious artificiality of many of the digital effects. These often take you out of the story partly because, unlike the impressionistic painted backdrops in old Hollywood films, they’re trying hard to replicate the real world. When a rope runs along a post, the heat rising from it looks faked, while it’s the grappling men who give the moment a fleeting vibrancy.The biggest mistake here, though, is a misbegotten decorousness that sinks the movie, stoving it as calamitously as an enraged whale. Whether out of squeamishness, Oscar ambitions or because the story never coheres, Mr. Howard puts his pulp instincts in check and consistently (tastefully) pulls back, deploying splatters rather than torrents. Yet Melville was drawn to the story of the Essex for good reason, including the ghastly turn of events that led Mr. Philbrick to drop memorable phrases like “gastronomic incest” into his book. There’s no such corollary — no frenzied horror, no unspeakable truth — in the movie, which takes a 19th-century story of man’s survival in nature and turns it into a reminder that the whole domination of nature thing wasn’t such a great idea.“In the Heart of the Sea” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

This documentary, which follows a group of American G.I.s in Afghanistan in 2011, uses footage taken during their missions, sometimes via their own helmet cams. The sense of danger is palpable, as is the sense of misery after the most dreadful scenes.“War is boring until it’s punctured by these moments of heart-stopping terror,” one soldier says. He and the others are members of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, and their civilian roles are varied: hospital workers, mechanics, police officers. After their deployment to Afghanistan, however, they band together to secure territory and engage the enemy.Their duties range from the mundane to the perilous, and the footage, edited by Jason Mergott (David Salzberg and Christian Tureaud are the directors), conveys a good sense of their operations, even amid the confusions of battle. Scenes in which bullets whiz past, and bombs explode nearby, are terrifying. Nothing here comes off as contrived or overexplained, making it all feel still more immersive. Only the added music can be distracting.Just as notable are the film’s respectful tone and its lack of cheerleading. No political screeds are delivered; also absent are debates over the war or over the inevitable problems that arrive in its aftermath. The choice isn’t an oversight, but a chance to provide a straightforward account of these men and their work.That directness only heightens the esteem due these soldiers, even if they are reluctant to see themselves as admirable. Perhaps that’s the thing about the brave — they don’t think of themselves as such.KEN JAWOROWSKI“Citizen Soldier” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for scenes of warfare and the resulting casualties.",0,,,1

But there’s no escaping that the found-footage phenomenon has gone from fresh and original to just plain annoying.Here it is a teenager named Hector (Jorge Diaz) who is most often wielding the video camera, which apparently came with a permanently charged battery. He and his pal Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) along with the pretty Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) are curious about the noises coming from a neighbor’s apartment, and soon they find themselves peering in on a world of witchcraft. Jesse becomes more than a mere voyeur thanks to a mark on his arm that identifies him as having strange powers, among them the ability to inflate an air mattress really quickly. Another of the film’s droll touches is that an old Simon electronic game — that circle whose quadrants light up — becomes a sort of Ouija board for the teenagers, using its blinking lights to answer the questions they ask it. The “Paranormal Activity” movies tend to rely on the occasional memorable special effect rather than brainy dialogue, and this one has a few, including one involving a gravity-defying dog. It also works in a cameo by Katie Featherston, a fixture in all the previous films. Have to keep the through-line going somehow.These touches, though, can’t overcome the general weariness of the whole genre. Yeah, the found-footage thing was cool once, maybe twice. But even the teenagers this movie is aimed at have now seen the dim lighting, the choppy storytelling and the nausea-inducing jitteriness again and again. As Jesse says at one point in this film in reference to his powers: “I felt like I was special or something.

A 19-year-old Latina, she faces daunting challenges: her best friend is in an abusive relationship; her mother wants her to be a homemaker; her boyfriend has no ambition.She knows what she likes — dancing to hip-hop, in group face-offs at an underground night spot — but beyond that her aspirations are unclear. Her high school teacher wants to help, but he can’t grasp the weight of her burdens.Carmen may be hurting, but she’s strong, nobody’s fool and, man, can she move. As played by Aimee Garcia (George Lopez’s niece on his former sitcom), she also has many dimensions, thanks to the supple script and capable direction of Carmen Marron, the force behind “Go for It!,” an unpretentious rite-of-passage drama whose merits belie the banality of its title.Set in rough quarters of Chicago, the film offers a brawny, clear-eyed perspective — urban without Los Angeles or New York glossy dross — and an overcast aesthetic to match. All-girl troupe battles have blunt immediacy; they’re briskly edited, but lacking the swooping cameras, neon and dry ice of the dance-out-of-the-slums genre.The cast is well chosen. As Carmen’s best friend, Gina Rodriguez conveys terror behind a fun-loving veneer; as Carmen’s affluent white boyfriend, Derrick Denicola is pretty, charming and spineless. Al Bandiero, as the teacher, is noble but unfussy.Best of all, “Go for It!” speaks to working-class young women without ignoring issues like race, class tensions and domestic violence. It’s never mawkish, even at its understated climax. Uplift with minimal fanfare? That’s no small feat. Latin spice only helps.“Go for It!” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes under-age drinking, sexual situations and profanity.",0,,,0

Based on what we’ve seen, she may not make it another week, let alone four months.Since returning from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Sarge (Kate Nowlin) swings between confusion and rage. After losing control at her coming-home party (a scene no less tense for being inevitable), she leaves her husband to stay at a secluded campground by a Minnesota lake. There she works nearly nonstop, or exercises to exhaustion, or drinks herself into a stupor to keep her demons at bay.There’s not much more plot. This drama, written by Ms. Nowlin and her husband, Remy Auberjonois, who also directed, centers on Sarge’s inner struggles. Other than a few references to her combat service and to a physical injury she sustained, the script relies on subtext and Ms. Nowlin’s expressions to convey her condition. She’s up to the task; even in the many silent moments, she’s compelling.Still, while this worthy film sidesteps clichés — there are no horrid flashbacks or emotional speeches — its spareness occasionally feels planned rather than spontaneous. After a powerful first half, later scenes offer diminishing returns.One of many recent works to study post-traumatic stress (including the documentary “Thank You for Your Service” and the novel “Preparation for the Next Life,” which both focused almost exclusively on men), “Blood Stripe” refuses to moralize or explain itself. That could seem like either a cryptic decision or an admirable stance. More than likely, it’s a good bit of both.",0,,,0

When Tara returns to India, they decide to never meet again, their idyll forever in amber.Years pass, and Tara, still smitten, tracks down Ved. He is now a dull if prosperous product manager, making remarks like “Countries are companies, and companies are countries,” while she is a globe-hopping businesswoman. His job stifles his theatrical imagination, and Tara soon rejects him. When she reconsiders, it is he who rejects her.

O. SCOTT,"All at Sea, Surrounded by Red Herrings","“Shutter Island” takes place off the coast of Massachusetts in 1954. I’m sorry, that should be OFF THE COAST OF MASSACHUSETTS! IN 1954! since every detail and incident in the movie, however minor, is subjected to frantic, almost demented (and not always unenjoyable) amplification. The wail of strangled cellos accompanies shots of the titular island, a sinister, rain-lashed outcropping that is home to a mental hospital for the CRIMINALLY INSANE! The color scheme is lurid, and the camera movements telegraph anxiety. Nothing is as it seems. Something TERRIBLE is afoot.Sadly, that something turns out to be the movie itself, directed by Martin Scorsese and adapted by Laeta Kalogridis from a peculiar contraption of a thriller by Dennis Lehane. Like Shutter Island in the opening scenes, the full dimensions of the catastrophe come into view only gradually. At first everything is fine, or at least not quite right in a way that seems agreeably intriguing. Mr. Scorsese uses his considerable formal dexterity — his intimate, comprehensive understanding of how sound and image work together to create meanings and moods — to conjure a tingly atmosphere of uncertainty and dread.The vessel of these anxieties is Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Teddy Daniels, a United States marshal taking a ferry ride out to the island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. Mr. DiCaprio, having grown perhaps overly fond of his accent from “The Departed,” brings it along for the ride, and it spreads through the movie like a contagious disease. Teddy’s partner (pahtnah), Chuck Aule, played by Mark (Mahk) Ruffalo, is supposed to be from the Pacific Northwest but he seems to have left all his R’s back in Seattle. Michelle Williams pops up in smudgy, color-drenched memories and hallucinations as Teddy’s dead wife, Dolores, her intonations as thick and clammy as chowder.Those dialect-coached Boston inflections predominate in “Shutter Island,” but are not the only voices heard on the grounds of the asylum, where the patients perambulate like zombies and the orderlies lurk like vengeful specters. Ben Kingsley is Dr. Cawley, the psychiatrist in charge, with silky upper-crust menace in his voice and a diabolical little beard on his chin. Max von Sydow spouts Freudianisms in insinuating Germanic tones that remind Teddy — and of course not only Teddy — of Nazis, an association that helps to induce gratuitous flashbacks of corpses stacked outside death-camp barracks.Those images emanate from Teddy’s troubled mind, the status of which is one of the movie’s chief mysteries. There are many others besides. Intimations of conspiracy, supernaturalism, cold war shenanigans and a whole lot more float around in the atmosphere, which is convulsed by operatically bad weather and the energetic furrowing of Mr. DiCaprio’s brow. As he interviews patients and staff members, trying to figure out how a woman named Rachel Solando could have vanished, barefoot, from her cell, Teddy is plagued by headaches, bad dreams and paranoia. Everyone he talks to seems to be harboring a secret, but what can it be?Is there some kind of espionage-related psychological experimentation going on? Is it connected in some way to grisly medical research undertaken during the Third Reich? Are Dr. Cawley’s methods, which he claims are a humane advance over the cruelty and superstition of the past, really a form of madness in their own right? And what about the strange coincidence that Shutter Island apparently houses the firebug who caused Dolores’s death?All of these riddles send out tendrils of implication that end up strangling the movie, the plot of which does not so much thicken as clog and coagulate. Mr. Scorsese, ever resourceful, draws on the influence of Alfred Hitchcock, the master of carefully orchestrated psychological confusion, and also nods in the direction of Mario Bava, the Italian horror maestro whose gothic fantasias routinely assert the triumph of sensation over sense. Mr. Scorsese’s camera sense effectively fills every scene with creepiness, but sustained, gripping suspense seems beyond his grasp.And the movie’s central dramatic problem — the unstable boundary between the reality of Shutter Island and Teddy’s perception of it — becomes less interesting as the story lurches along. You begin to suspect almost immediately that a lot of narrative misdirection is at work here, as MacGuffins and red herrings spawn and swarm. But just when the puzzle should accelerate, the picture slows down, pushing poor Teddy into a series of encounters with excellent actors (Emily Mortimer, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson) who provide painstaking exposition of matters that the audience already suspects are completely irrelevant.Mr. Scorsese in effect forces you to study the threads on the rug he is preparing, with lugubrious deliberateness, to pull out from under you. As the final revelations approach, the stakes diminish precipitously, and the sense that the whole movie has been a strained and pointless contrivance starts to take hold.There are, of course, those who will resist this conclusion, in part out of loyalty to Mr. Scorsese, a director to whom otherwise hard-headed critics are inclined to extend the benefit of the doubt. But in this case the equivocation, the uncertainty, seems to come from the filmmaker himself, who seems to have been unable to locate what it is in this movie he cares about, beyond any particular, local formal concern. He has, in the past, used characters whose grasp of reality was shaky — or who stubbornly lived in realities of their own making — as vehicles for psychological exploration and even social criticism. But both Teddy’s mind and the world of Shutter Island are closed, airless systems, illuminated with flashes of virtuosity but with no particular heat, conviction or purpose.“Shutter Island” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,Just Try Borrowing a Cup of Sugar,"At an especially stressful moment in their domestic life — they are in the midst of an escalating battle with the fraternity next door, about which more shortly — Mac and Kelly, a married couple with a cute (and notably quiet) baby daughter, have a fight. At issue is who has the right to be irresponsible. Although they have a kid, a mortgage and other trappings of grown-up life, neither is entirely willing to give up the wild, impulsive behavior associated with youth. Mac (Seth Rogen) thinks his gender (and perhaps also his body type) entitles him to be the self-indulgent one. “We can’t both be Kevin James,” he says. And of course, he points out, Kelly (Rose Byrne) is a wife and mother, a bit of biological typecasting she furiously resents, and one that “Neighbors” rejects. This argument is a minor episode in a film (directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O’Brien) that has a lot of other things on its mind: marijuana, sex toys, Zac Efron’s muscles and enough pop-culture flotsam to dominate a year’s worth of pub trivia nights. The usual stuff. But the scene nonetheless marks a significant point in the evolution of what French critics (who take such matters very seriously) have called “le nouvel âge d’or de la comédie américaine.” The central problem in American film comedy for the past 15 years or so — let’s say from middle-period Sandler through prime Apatow and late “Hangover” — has been maturity, or, more precisely, its avoidance. In the old days, adulthood was a fact. Now it’s a vague, unproven theory. Adolescence used to represent constraint and frustration, to be left behind as quickly as possible. For the heroes of the New American Comedy, it represents a blissful state of hedonistic freedom, to be held onto for as long as possible.How to stay a child when the world expects otherwise — and how to make the world love you anyway — has usually been, in these movies, a male predicament. Women have been sirens or mommies, on hand to inflame the boys’ desires or soothe their fears. This has begun to change recently, although mainly on television, where shows like “Girls” and “Broad City” have extended the privileges of arrested development on a more or less equal-opportunity basis.“Neighbors” does something a little different. It fuses romantic traditionalism with new-school naughtiness and imagines marriage not as a prison but as a shared playground. Not that parenthood is all fun and games for Kelly and Mac. She is bored staying home with their daughter, and he is bored at work, a situation that both upholds and subverts the Ozzie and Harriet stereotype. He’s hardly a professional go-getter. The movie doesn’t even bother to specify what he does for a living. What does anyone do? He wears a tie and sits in a cubicle. At home, there’s sex (when the baby doesn’t interrupt), weed (though not so much for Kelly while she’s nursing) and fast-moving, highly referential comic banter.But it can’t all be jokes and joints and coitus interruptus. Comedy thrives on conflict, which arrives in the form of that fraternity. The house next door to Kelly and Mac’s is (somewhat improbably, but whatever) purchased by the local college’s chapter of Delta Psi Beta, whose members make the couple feel old and also keep them awake at night with loud music and nonstop debauchery. The president is an abdominally gifted young scholar named Teddy (Mr. Efron), who is determined to make party history, assisted by his best bro, Pete (Dave Franco), and the rest of their brothers. Kelly and Mac try to befriend these dudes, but despite certain shared interests, relations sour quickly. Soon enough, the Greeks and their neighbors are at war, and “Neighbors” ascends to an impressively high level of farcical anarchy. Mr. Stoller, whose previous films as a director are “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” “Get Him to the Greek” and “The Five-Year Engagement,” is good at keeping the momentum going while also finding time for offbeat grace notes and occasional bursts of emotional candor. Mac and Kelly’s fights account for some of those, but so do Teddy and Pete as their ideas of collegiate life and its aftermath start to diverge.I don’t want to create the wrong impression. The insightful glimmers matter to the film’s credibility, but they also provide a scaffolding of sincerity for the abundant drug-, sex- and body-based humor. The best gags involve human lactation and automobile air bags (not at the same time). Nobody really gets hurt.As is customary for projects like this, a flash mob of very funny secondary performers has been assembled, both to exercise their skills and to elicit chuckles of recognition from clued-in (which is to say couch-bound) members of the audience. Andy Samberg and the guys from “Workaholics” show up in blink-and-you-miss-it cameos, while Christopher Mintz-Plasse pursues the further adventures of McLovin. Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo are amusing as the wacky friends on hand to make Mac and Kelly seem conventional. Hannibal Buress ambles by to steal a scene or two as a police officer. Lisa Kudrow does the same as a college dean, and Jerrod Carmichael wins the prize for funniest and most counter-stereotypical fraternity brother.“Neighbors” is not a great film and does not really aspire to be. It is more a status report on mainstream American movie comedy, operating in a sweet spot between the friendly and the nasty, and not straining to be daring, obnoxious or even especially original. It knows how to have fun. How very grown-up. “Neighbors” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Hire a sitter.",0,134413041.0,150086800.0,0

It could use one: this hasn’t been a memorable year for cinematic action, aside from a quicksilver move here and there and that gone-in-60-seconds moment in “Drive” when Ryan Gosling glides a car into park. But now there’s “The Yellow Sea,” a rush of a movie from South Korea that slips and slides from horror to humor on rivers of blood and offers the haunting image of a man, primitive incarnate, beating other men with an enormous, gnawed-over meat bone.Even on second viewing, that bone scene is a shocker in a movie with more than one. When I first saw “The Yellow Sea” in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown under the bluntly literal title “The Murderer,” the audience burst into applause several times, jolted by the choreographed frenzy of the movie’s car and foot chases. Those chases are so exciting, and the blood is so unnerving, that I didn’t at first realize that they’re in service to a moral tale, one in which the struggle between good and evil plays out in often unsettling visual terms: that bone isn’t just a convenient weapon but also an emblem of this man-eat-dog, man-kill-man world.Dogs, dead or furiously barking and snapping, are a recurrent motif in “The Yellow Sea,” which opens with its hapless central character, a taxi driver, Gu-nam (Ha Jung-woo, subtle and moving), relating a story in voice-over. When he was young, Gu-nam says, his dog became rabid, a killer. The local villagers tried to destroy the animal, but it ran off only to return later, whereupon it lay down and died. After Gu-nam buried his dog, the elders dug it up and devoured the carcass. “The rabies that vanished has come back,” he says. “It’s going around.” On screen, a photo of an unsmiling child gives way to the adult Gu-nam losing at mah-jongg, a suggestion of generational misery.Written and directed by Na Hong-jin, “The Yellow Sea” follows Gu-nam as he descends into a nightmare that he helps create. The story takes off in Yanji, the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, a wedge of China that borders North Korea and Russia. Initially, Gu-nam, an ethnic Korean (or chosun-juk), spends his time losing money at mahjongg, driving a cab or passed out in his squalid apartment, where a web of broken glass covering a framed wedding photo of him and his wife hints at the tragic misunderstanding that sets the story in fast, fast motion. His wife has left to find work in South Korea, and Gu-nam, bereft, angry, self-pitying, has built up a debt that he seems unlikely to work or gamble his way out of.When he can’t pay what he owes, he lands before a gangster, Myun-ga (Kim Yun-seok, in a tour de force performance), who will wipe out Gu-nam’s debt if he kills a man. Stoop-shouldered and somewhat sleepy, Myun-ga doesn’t look like much of a danger, but menace radiates off him, especially because he makes his offer in a dog market.It’s a scene of disturbing noise and visual chaos, a snapshot of Myun-ga’s worldview and perhaps Gu-nam’s fate, as some dogs wildly lunge at one another, straining at their leashes, while others sit in cages, some presumably awaiting their culinary fate. Don’t think too hard about what the men later slurp from their bowls, but don’t freak out either: the only blood spilled is human.And blood there is, gushing and splattering, in a story that combines Grand Guignol levels of sanguineous spectacle with raw realism. Amid all the spray, there are double-crosses, a clandestine trip to Seoul, an undertow of politics, a gang boss (Cho Seong-ha) and chases that are as spectacularly choreographed and sometimes as funny as those in a Looney Tunes cartoon.Mr. Na, reunited with the cinematographer and editor who worked on his feature debut, “The Chaser,” makes this movie’s 157 minutes fly with scenes that alternately take their time and compress life histories into a few shots and words. When Gu-nam visits a relative, the family’s entire story — its hopes and crushing defeats — is telegraphed by the shabbiness of a room and an old man’s one-sentence apology.Despite the opening voice-over, Gu-nam doesn’t explain much. What happened between him and his wife surfaces gradually, mostly through flashbacks and bits of conversation, while his personality comes into focus through his deeds, some of which are seemingly absurd, as when he takes a food break from playing amateur assassin, stepping out to eat a hot dog on a stick.Again and again, Mr. Na affirms Gu-nam’s humanity, showing a man hungry, cold and terminally alone, even as that humanity seems to drain away because of his bad choices and actions. In “The Yellow Sea” the kinetic filmmaking viscerally conveys the palpitating fear of the chase and the thrill of escape in a movie that suggests that — for all the miles Gu-nam racks up — for him there may be no exit.“The Yellow Sea” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Extreme ax, knife and meat-bone violence.",1,,,1

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Eva Hesse’ Offers a Moving Portrait of an Artist’s Brief Life,"In 1964, when Eva Hesse went to Germany on a fellowship with her husband, the sculptor Tom Doyle, she was a talented 28-year-old painter with a blue-chip education (Cooper Union and Yale) and a foothold in the art world. By the time of her death six years later, from brain cancer, she was widely recognized as a major artist, a maker of category-confounding forms — abstract and visceral, minimalist and feminist, sculptural and painterly — that have lost none of their power in the decades since.“Eva Hesse,” Marcie Begleiter’s conscientious and moving documentary, tells the full story of its subject’s tragically foreshortened life, but it focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art. Hesse herself is both a ubiquitous presence in the film and something of a specter — an animating spirit and a ghost haunting the frames. She is remembered by friends, colleagues and her sister, Helen Hesse Charash. Her work is analyzed by curators and critics. Mr. Doyle is on hand to reflect, tactfully and ruefully, on the ups and downs of their relationship.Everyone is middle-aged or older, mostly dressed in 21st-century studio or academic mufti. Hesse, in contrast, is a revenant from a cooler, smokier, scruffier decade, eternally and intriguingly youthful. At times resembling the actress Dakota Johnson, she appears mainly in black-and-white still photographs, some of which are digitally massaged so that they seem to move ever so slightly. Her voice is heard once, in a snippet of audiotape. But Ms. Begleiter has made ample and judicious use of Hesse’s letters and diaries, passages of which are read in voice-over by Selma Blair. These selections, along with the pictures, create a powerful illusion of immediacy, a sense of the personality disclosed and obscured by the art.Like many creative people, Hesse veered from heroic confidence to crippling doubt, but in every phase, she seemed capable of remarkable clarity, humor and warmth. Among her closest confidants was Sol LeWitt, the scholarly, sphinxlike Conceptualist visionary who was the subject of an excellent documentary by Chris Teerink a few years ago. Their correspondence is clearly a remarkable trove of art world gossip, fraternal feeling and critical insight, and it provides this film its emotional and intellectual grounding. (LeWitt’s parts are read by the actor Patrick Kennedy.) But the drama of “Eva Hesse” is a story of mastery and self-discovery, of a woman asserting her autonomy in a male-dominated professional realm.Hesse was born to a Jewish family in Hamburg in 1936. She and her sister left Germany on a Kindertransport train. Their parents managed to escape the Nazis as well, but many of their relatives were killed during World War II, and the girls’ mother committed suicide in 1946. Though the Holocaust was never an overt theme in Hesse’s work, Ms. Begleiter traces the shadow it cast on her life, especially during her sojourn in Germany with Mr. Doyle.The film is frank about Hesse’s personal life without being prurient, and it conveys a vivid sense of the sexual politics of the New York art world in the 1960s, a scene still dominated by the myth of the heroic male creator. Hesse’s response was to cultivate her own heroism, a powerfully idiosyncratic style that could be earthy, delicate, whimsical and sublime, sometimes all at once. “Eva Hesse” pays a gratifying amount of attention to the thinking and the techniques that produced her art, and invites viewers to contemplate it further. It’s like a comprehensive exhibition catalog or a thorough critical essay — an indispensable aid to understanding and appreciating a fascinating artist.“Eva Hesse” is not rated.

Much like Mr. Baldwin’s previous cut-and-paste works — including the film “Tribulation 99,” his self-professed “pseudo-pseudo-documentary” about American interventions in Latin America — this new work hits your synapses like a cluster bomb, assailing your tremulous gray matter with a barrage of cinematic fragments (most recycled, some newly shot), miscellaneous rants and ruminations.Divided into 13 chapters, “Mock Up on Mu” — shot on 16 millimeter and shown digitally  — recounts some of the more far-out and apparently true tales involving American inner and outer space travel. The Web site for the movie (othercinema.com/mu.html) contains the coy assertion that it’s “(mostly) true,” which is the kind of truth in advertising that should be more widely adopted. More to the point, this defensive assertion may be directed at anyone who might take offense at the gently parodic portrait of one of its main characters, L. Ron Hubbard (the filmmaker Damon Packard), whose trippy musings blend in with those of Jack Parsons (Kal Spelletich), a founder   of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; his wife, Marjorie Cameron (Michelle Silva); and some guy named Lockheed Martin (Stoney Burke).A maximalist, Mr. Baldwin is at once a collector and curator of 20th-century visual culture. Working with the editor Sylvia Schedelbauer, he pulls together a wide range of fiction and nonfiction images, stitching his story from familiar bits and oddball pieces that he’s borrowed from our shared imaginary museum. Everything is grist for his mill, though he tends to be something of an antiquarian, mixing unidentified clips from the 1950 women-in-prison movie “Caged” with Cary Grant dodging a truck in Hitchcock’s 1959 classic, “North by Northwest”; a bit from the first “Star Trek” series; and Ray Milland lurching about in sunglasses that hide his eerie X-ray-vision eyes in Roger Corman’s 1963 flick, “X.”“Mock Up on Mu” — the title refers to several terms from Scientology, though it also sounds like a punning nod to mockumentary — has its pleasures, visual and otherwise. It’s fun to watch and puzzle through, though it also makes for a somewhat fatiguing 110 minutes because Mr. Baldwin, perhaps in a bid to get around copyright laws and fair-use questions that arise whenever an artist borrows someone else’s work, moves through his material very quickly, deploying confetti-size edits that tend to run together without enough modulation. Even so, the movie charms as much as it confounds, as it hovers in the twilight zone between real life and the imaginary world, between history and its interpolations, between what you know and what you wish you believed.",0,,,1

That “Paraguayan Hammock” happens to be one of the few features to emerge from the country in recent decades in no way diminishes  its rarity.The filmmaker Paz Encina does wondrous things in an overly familiar style of international art-house formalism: long, fixed takes of carefully arranged scenes; the meticulous orchestration of environmental noises; an oblique handling of character and continuity.In the opening shot two elderly peasants (Ramón Del Rio and Georgina Genes) materialize from a thick green forest, suspend a length of fabric between trees and settle down to contemplate the weather (oppressive, thundering), the yelping of a nearby dog and the fate of its absent master, their son, a soldier off at war.Everything is elsewhere in “Paraguayan Hammock,” and as Ms. Encina proceeds from one lucid tableau to another (hearth, harvest, laundry, lunch), she hints at rich temporal ambiguities.

Well, as low as anything starring Halle Berry goes. It’s probable that Ms. Berry was the priciest item in the budget, followed by the movie’s one other conspicuous expenditure, a sprawling 911 dispatch center called the hive. Buzzing with the trills of incoming calls and the hum of reassuring voices, the hive is where every rote greeting — “911, what is your emergency?” — becomes the opening line in a never-ending procession of melodramas, comedies, dramas, tragedies and horror stories like the one that puts the chill in this no-frills diversion. Put another way “911, what is your emergency?” is “once upon a time” with higher or at least more shudderingly plausible stakes. That’s the clean, clever premise of “The Call,” which, along with being a movie about a woman in trouble helping other women (and a few men) in trouble, is something of a salute to your tax dollars at work. Like Steven Soderbergh’s epidemiological nightmare, “Contagion,” in which a miscellany of federal agencies saves humanity, the heroes in “The Call,” including Jordan (a fine Ms. Berry), are largely Los Angeles government workers — beat cops, fingerprint technicians and call-center operators of all races and ethnicities — who are presumably collecting a livable wage and benefits. Given how many extra miles Jordan runs, crawls and scrambles, she earns her overtime.“The Call” is also a recovery story because, soon after the movie opens, Jordan calamitously fumbles a phone plea for help. Years later in movie time, she remains haunted by that bad call and now trains new dispatchers and pops prescription pills. But, as John Wayne says in “Rio Bravo, “sorry don’t get it done” — nor does it win the audience’s sympathy and hold its attention. Which is why, after an inexperienced operator starts bungling a distress call from a kidnapped teenager, Casey (Abigail Breslin, at once grown up and believably adolescent), Jordan climbs back in the saddle. Jaw and shoulders squared, she puts on her headset, stares purposely ahead and, as rescue plans go into overdrive, starts smooth-talking Casey down from convulsive hysteria to panic.The kicker is that Casey has been kidnapped from a parking garage by a stranger (Michael Eklund), and is calling from inside the trunk of a moving car. It’s a harrowing situation for her and a potentially tricky one for filmmakers, as is apparent from how dissimilar directors handle characters trapped in rooms, coffins, airplanes and the claustrophobia-inducing like. Here, the director Brad Anderson, working from Richard D’Ovidio’s script, tucks you inside a car trunk with Casey, using close-ups that turn her face into a vista and tears into rivers. And, then, just when you’ve grown accustomed to that face, have started worrying about it, he cuts to Jordan who — with the call center often blurred behind her, as if the world and its certainties were disappearing — is in a very different tight place. “The Call” doesn’t lavish time on Jordan’s psychology: she has a boyfriend, Paul (Morris Chestnut), and a troubled past, but mostly she has intelligence, integrity, a sense of grave purpose and righteousness. She’s an old-fashioned hero in many respects, so it’s fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old-fashioned filmmaking techniques, like crosscutting, to build tension, and old-school exploitation tricks, like evil, to justify taking the story dark, and then dark and bonkers. He slithers under your skin easily. Yet even as he ably demonstrates his gift for making meaning visually, say, by playing interiors against exteriors, he never showboats at Casey and Jordan’s expense. His focus remains on these two, who, like a lot of women, know how to talk their way out of anything. “The Call” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bloody violence, disturbing wigs and the usual crude language.",1,,51872378.0,0

At a church dance, Seretse, played by David Oyelowo, meets Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike). The two eye each other warily as the band bleats. He asks her if she likes jazz; she insists she does, only not as she’s ever heard any British musicians play it. Soon they are swapping 78s by mail, and dating. One night he kneels to propose.There are, of course, complications. A good number of them are predictable, but they go deeper than a viewer unfamiliar with their story might have expected. Seretse’s homeland, Bechuanaland (now Botswana), an African protectorate under British control, sits directly above South Africa, which in the late 1940s was instituting the murderous policy of apartheid. The British, therefore, were deeply invested in not alienating South Africa’s rulers. And Seretse’s uncle is not keen on the returning king bringing home a white queen.For all the tumult surrounding them, the couple remain the focus of the film. The director, Amma Asante (working from a script by Guy Hibbert, who adapted Susan Williams’s 2006 nonfiction book “Colour Bar”), emphasizes this in her staging of the unequivocal and unaffected affection and regard they exchange.Here, as with her 2014 feature, “Belle,” Ms. Asante addresses contemporary concerns via period romance, and her commitment to the romance is not a feint. At one point the movie shows political unrest churning into violence, and juxtaposes that with a scene of the pregnant Ruth going into labor. Were you to bet that the movie would follow the childbirth thread, you would win.This is also a very polite film. When, in a moment of frustration, Seretse swipes his arm across his desktop, knocking papers off it, Ms. Asante cuts before a single sheet, or any other object, hits the floor. For all that, the movie depicts the appalling political gamesmanship that conspires to keep Seretse and Ruth apart (including, in a shocking twist, a betrayal by a historical figure who’s almost exclusively lauded in pop-culture portrayals) with consistent clarity. And while her filmmaking style can sometimes come across as staid, her sense of pace is always acute.The best reason to see “A United Kingdom,” however, is the performance by Mr. Oyelowo, who is also one of the film’s producers. As written by Mr. Hibbert, Seretse Khama is a character of stock wisdom and nobility — on introduction, practically his first words are “I see an Africa that’s about unity, inclusion and equality.” But Mr. Oyelowo, who is one of the best actors working today onstage or onscreen, imbues his portrayal of Seretse (who in 1966 became the democratically elected president of the independent Botswana) with a disarming delicacy and vulnerability that make the strengths he is later forced to show all the more convincing. It is remarkable, genuinely riveting work.The other actors are also very fine for the most part: Ms. Pike’s Ruth conveys a commanding intelligence, and Vusi Kunene and Terry Pheto are two different kinds of proud in portraying Seretse’s disapproving kin. (Tom Felton, as an underhanded British bureaucrat, seems to be hard pressed to avoid twirling his waxed mustache, on the other hand.) But it’s Mr. Oyelowo who truly makes “A United Kingdom” a deeper, more rewarding film.",1,3901302.0,3803698.0,0

The image of his hand caressing a woman’s sleek blond hair in close-up indicates that it’s a lovely head, a lovely wife, too. Yet the violence of his words — he speaks of cracking her skull open and “unspooling” her brain — wakens an unease that trembles throughout this domestic horror movie. Those familiar with Mr. Fincher’s work may wonder, perhaps with a shudder or a conspiratorial smile, whether this head will share the fate of another head belonging to another pretty wife, a gift that was boxed and delivered in one of the hellish circles girdling his shocker “Seven.” Unspooling is such an inapt word — can brains, after all, be unspooled? — that it immediately puts dread in check. No matter how brutal the images generated by these words, surely there’s more in store than blunt-force entertainment. Well, yes and no, which is sometimes the case with Mr. Fincher. One of those filmmakers whose technical prowess can make the mediocrity of his material seem irrelevant (almost), Mr. Fincher is always the star of his work. His art can overwhelm characters and their stories to the point that they fade away, leaving you with meticulous staging and framing, and edits as sharp as blades. It’s no accident that the first time you fully see Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), the man who had been discoursing so vividly about his wife’s head, he’s alone. (“Gone Girl” opens the 52nd New York Film Festival on Friday and opens in theaters next Friday.)“Gone Girl” is set in the recessionary present in a small fictional Missouri town, North Carthage. Around the time you meet Nick, Mr. Fincher folds in some typical snapshots of desperate Anytown, U.S.A.: empty shops, vacant streets and homeless people tramping into the void. Nick and his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), aren’t headed for Brokesville quite yet, but they’re clinging hard to the status quo. They’re leasing their big, ugly house, and their bank account is running on fumes. The screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, adapting her novel of the same title, was a television critic for Entertainment Weekly who was laid off, and her characters share the same hard-knock fate: Nick, some kind of magazine writer, lost his New York job, as did Amy, who wrote quizzes for women’s magazines. (Was that a job? A. Yes, B. No, C. I doubt it.)Times are hard, kind of, for Nick and Amy, but, as you discover in a series of flashbacks, they moved to North Carthage only when Nick’s mother received a cancer diagnosis. She died, and shortly after, so did the bloom on the marriage, though how it fades depends on who’s confessing and complaining. In the book, the narrative duties are fairly evenly distributed between Nick and Amy, who recount alternating versions of their happy times and unhappily ever after, with him taking you through events as they happen in the first person, while her point of view comes into focus partly through her detailed diary entries. The movie more or less duplicates this he-says, she-writes pattern, although with a critical difference: Nick’s story doesn’t unfold wholly through his first-person account.Mr. Fincher, for all his modern themes and bleeding-edge technologies, is a classicist, and in “Gone Girl,” he creates a sense of Nick’s subjectivity the usual way, mostly by placing the camera next to the character and deploying point-of-view shots that are seamlessly integrated with shots of, and generated by, other characters. Shortly after the movie opens, the plot fires up, as you watch Nick return home to find that Amy has gone missing. You see him pick up their cat and watch him fling open doors, roam the halls and discover a broken glass table. In other words, here you know what Nick knows, which, as it will turn out, isn’t much. Amy is gone, and as Nick, the police, the town, the news media and the country shift into progressively more hysterical crisis-and-circus mode, she stays gone. Mr. Fincher’s compositions, camera work and cutting are, as always, superbly controlled. Working again with the cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and the production designer Donald Graham Burt, he fashions an ever more haunted, haunting world that wavers so violently between ordinariness and aberration that, as in his other movies, the two soon blur. Nick may feel at home in North Carthage, but, from that first shot of him alone in front of his house — and from his first conversation with his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), in which they trade insults about Amy — he comes across as alienated, lost. Mr. Fincher underlines that isolation by showing Nick both alone in the frame and in his house, where he’s at times dwarfed and almost swallowed up by its generic, oversize rooms.Amy’s voice-overs disrupt the movie’s inaugural seriousness. In flashbacks introduced by her scribbling in her diary, she reveals that she’s the inspiration for a beloved and profitable book series about a girl, Amazing Amy, created by her psychologist parents, Rand and Marybeth (David Clennon and Lisa Banes). Like Hannibal Lecter (a psychiatrist), Amy’s parents have profited from messing around in other people’s heads. (Your parents plagiarized your childhood, Nick says with husbandly commiseration.) They’re cartoons, but then, so is Amy, whose narration Ms. Pike delivers in an affectedly hushed, conspiratorial voice that’s so arch that you can picture Amy’s lips curling at the edges. Mr. Fincher doesn’t show you her sneer; he doesn’t have to. It imbues every word she says, instantly casting her as an unreliable narrator.Given that the first half of “Gone Girl” is structured as a mystery, this unreliability presents a problem because it throws everything Amy says into doubt. Along with Mr. Affleck’s supple, sympathetic performance, Amy’s voice-over tips the scales so far in Nick’s favor that it upends Ms. Flynn’s attempt to recreate the even-steven dynamic from her book. Then again, the movie is on Nick’s side from the start, making the case for him, from the way he services Amy sexually to the gentle way he treats their cat. He sometimes explodes, as when he throws a glass to the floor while talking to two cops, Boney (an excellent Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (a dryly funny Patrick Fugit). The Nick here, like so many noir heroes, is simply, too simply, a decent, deflated, ordinary sap with serious woman problems. The same is true of this movie. At its strongest, “Gone Girl” plays like a queasily, at times gleefully, funny horror movie about a modern marriage, one that has disintegrated partly because of spiraling downward mobility and lost privilege. Yet, as sometimes happens in Mr. Fincher’s work, dread descends like winter shadows, darkening the movie’s tone and visuals until it’s snuffed out all the light, air and nuance. As Nick becomes mired in the search for Amy, she confides how romance gave way to marital dreariness, accusations, his mounting loathing, her growing fear. One minute, he was leaving empty takeout containers strewn about and playing video games; the next, she says, he was raising a hand to her and she was cowering in their bed. She has the victim thing down cold. By the movie’s second half, you may wish that Amy would stay gone. Ms. Pike has some fine scenes in this section, notably with a pair of hilariously sly lowlifes, Greta and Jeff (Lola Kirke and Boyd Holbrook), who, taken with a pompous, wealthy fool (Neil Patrick Harris as Desi), suggest that the movie is about to go deeper, that it will surprise you or stir you or say something, anything, maybe by making good on its scene-setting images of empty American stores. That never happens, and instead, the movie just hums along like the precision machine it is, even after it shifts tones again and enters Grand Guignol territory, with a flashing knife, gushing blood and surveillance footage of a seemingly tortured, horrifically abused and screaming woman. It’s a ghastly vision, although not for the reasons this movie would like. “Gone Girl” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme violence.",0,,167762331.0,0

A lifelong friendship between two women is challenged when one of them falls in love, and their cozy co-dependence comes to an end. Sasha (Leighton Meester), a receptionist, and Paige (Gillian Jacobs), an environmental lawyer, are both 29, acutely aware of the passing time and under pressure to put their lives on steadier tracks. They are so close that they almost seem to share a secret language, and the relaxed intimacy of their friendship goes a long way toward filling the absence of serious romantic partners. Sasha, who is gay, gravitates toward bratty, clingy, younger women, some of whom still live with their parents. Paige’s search for Mr. Right is fruitless until she meets Tim (Adam Brody), a nice-looking, considerate, slightly nerdy dermatologist. Sexual orientation is not an issue: Neither Sasha nor Paige harbors a secret yearning for the other. They are totally comfortable talking about any subject, including their love lives. Sasha belongs to a quasi-incestuous clique of lesbians who are continually changing partners. The movie casts an acutely knowing eye on smart, likable, sexually freewheeling women whose depiction seems authentic, down to the tiniest details of their tastes in television and fashion. If there’s a common trait, it is their self-centeredness and stubborn insistence, when faced with conflict, that they are in the right.Foolishly cavalier about her day job at a real estate agency, Sasha tells everyone that she is really a musician (her idol is Patti Smith), although there are scant signs that she is actually writing songs or studying music. When Paige helpfully arranges for her to meet a slightly older woman, Sasha scoffs. Tim, to whom Paige becomes engaged after some disagreements about his clothes and her ignorance of his favorite movie (“The Big Lebowski”), has a zany imagination. His marriage proposal is a message scrawled on his back, which he bares when he asks her to inspect him for signs of skin cancer. He is the first person to stand up to Paige, who, like her grating mother (Julie White), refuses to admit that she is ever wrong. Paige’s obstinacy extends to her refusal to reimburse a next door neighbor whose car she damaged while driving and texting. If this all sounds trivial, it is. But in their trivial way, the characters’ disagreements and petty conflicts are painfully familiar signs of immaturity, and to a degree, “Life Partners” might be taken as a gently needling critique of the millennial generation. The strengths of “Life Partners” are its comfortably lived-in performances and the screenplay’s accumulation of minute details about the characters. The core of the drama is Sasha’s bereavement over her best friend’s partial abandonment. To her chagrin, she realizes that her days of dawdling and procrastination are over; it’s time to grow up. “Life Partners” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and sexual content.",0,7563.0,,1

A disillusioned primary-care doctor struggles to make sense of a system that reimburses according to volume rather than outcomes, forcing her to average seven minutes per patient. A young infantryman, injured in Afghanistan, battles to exchange a daunting prescription-pill regimen for alternative therapies to alleviate his post-traumatic stress disorder and nerve damage.Similarly, the film argues, we can switch from an unsustainable “disease management system” that relies on expensive drugs and often unnecessary medical procedures to one that focuses on prevention over cure. This is a drum that the doctors Andrew Weil and Dean Ornish have been beating for years, and “Escape Fire” cleverly weaves their concerns over poor lifestyle choices into a broader story of corporate lobbying and profit-driven care. Advocating freedom from a system that “doesn’t want you to die and doesn’t want you to get well,” this hard-hitting film leaves us finally more hopeful than despairing.“Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Filled with East End grit and “EastEnders” escapees, the ragtag story is merely an excuse to remind us, all too emphatically, that Londoners won’t lie down. So when a zombie horde is loosed from a 17th-century vault by two startled construction workers, its chomping progress is less terrifying to residents than galvanizing.Especially for a bunch of still-game geezers menaced in a retirement home. Led by Ray (Alan Ford), a crusty codger with the lungs of a carnival barker, these fogies are hellbent on proving that neither wheelchair nor hip replacement will slow them down. “We’re old-age pensioners!” Ray yells. “We’ve got to take care of ourselves!” Except that they don’t, because his enterprising grandson and assorted sidekicks are heading to the rescue — just as soon as they’ve finished their bank robbery.As subtle as its title, “Cockneys vs. Zombies” is mildly funny and easily likable. Lowered expectations are crucial; anyone looking for “Shaun of the Dead 2” faces certain disappointment. That said, Mr. Hoene hides a few surprises amid the rotting flesh (finally, someone has noticed that any zombie mob would logically include the under-5s), and Daniel Bronks’s photography reveals an East End gradually being swallowed by gleaming tower blocks. Ray’s not bothered: When you’ve fought off the Nazis, doing the same with greedy developers and the partly decomposed is a doddle.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,"Catfights and Class Struggles, but Not at Katz’s Deli","“What is this, some 1930s movie?” asks a character in “The Women.” If only! Of course, the line pays winking homage to a specific ’30s movie, directed by George Cukor and based on a notorious play by Clare Boothe Luce, that starred Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford and was also called “The Women.”Further comparison would only serve to demean that sleek and waspish artifact of a bygone era, and also to humiliate the remake, a witless, straining mess written and directed by Diane English, the creator of “Murphy Brown.” Watching it, you wait in vain for a moment of snappy repartee, of fresh emotion, of grace or charm or pathos. You wait, by the way, for a very long time — two hours that pass like the whole 13-episode jump-the-shark season of a series on basic cable — and what you get is Meg Ryan munching on a stick of butter dipped in cocoa powder as she rants and raves to her au pair (Tilly Scott Pedersen) and her maid (Cloris Leachman) about the sorry state of her life.And that’s the best scene in the movie. At least it gives Ms. Ryan, who otherwise has to oscillate between ditzy and mopey, a chance to remind us that she is still the spitfire who won America’s heart when she faked an orgasm at Katz’s Deli. In “The Women,” she certainly works at faking something — pluck? distress? belief in the script? — but table-pounding ecstasy, or even simple, modest pleasure, is beyond this movie’s range.Ms. Ryan plays Mary Haines, part of a circle of friends that includes Edie (Debra Messing), Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith) and, supremely, Annette Bening as Sylvie. One of the film’s clever conceits, borrowed from the original, is that it entirely banishes men. And yet, far from liberating the women from male domination, this trick serves only to emphasize their dependence on the caprices of patriarchal authority. The invisible men in “The Women” wield an almost mystical power.Only Alex, a lesbian and a celebrated essayist, is immune, but she disappears for much of the movie (lucky her). Edie, meanwhile, is pregnant for the fifth time, while the never-married Sylvie, a magazine editor with crisp suits and a posture of easy, confident command, lives in constant fear of being fired by her male publisher. Mary, in spite of the energy with which she devotes herself to work, family, cooking, gardening and everything else, is employed by her father and, it turns out, at the mercy of her philandering stockbroker husband.“Sex and the City,” where plenty of men hang around and have speaking parts, was able, on the big screen but especially on television, to create and maintain an autonomous space of female friendship. However big they might have been, the dudes knew their place, which was at the margin of the charmed circle of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte. Here, the fathers and husbands cast a longer, darker shadow. While it’s possible that this is Ms. English’s point, it’s one that contradicts and ultimately makes incoherent her celebration of female self-sufficiency and solidarity.Really, though, muddled sexual politics are not the main problem. If “The Women” had managed to give its various impulses some kind of coherent shape or tone, it might be worth arguing about. As it is, the movie wanders and wallows, stumbling toward screwball before veering in the direction of weepiness and grasping at satirical urbanity along the way.At the heart of the hectic story is Mary’s discovery that her husband is having an affair with Crystal (Eva Mendes), a gold-digging vixen who works at the perfume counter at Saks Fifth Avenue. The strain of top-down class resentment in the way her character is portrayed — mean, selfish, cheap and vulgar — is perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie, and also, perhaps, the most honest. At bottom, this is less a movie about defending a marriage or battling for a man than it is about the protection of social privilege. Out in the suburbs, the loyal servants stand by their mistress (and seem to have no private lives or desires of their own), while in the city the lower orders scheme and gossip and connive to steal what can never be rightfully theirs.And of course, the heroic women of “The Women” will not concede without a fight. But rarely has class struggle, or catfighting, for that matter, been so tediously waged. And rarely have so many fine actresses been enlisted in such a futile cause. They all deserved better, and it hurts especially to watch Ms. Bening and Candice Bergen (who plays Mary’s mother) lend their wit and dignity to a project that has so little of its own.“The Women” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references and some strong language.THE WOMENOpens on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Diane English; based on the play by Clare Boothe Luce and the motion picture screenplay by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin; director of photography, Anastas Michos; edited by Tia Nolan; music by Mark Isham; production designer, Jane Musky; produced by Victoria Pearman, Mick Jagger, Bill Johnson and Ms. English; released by Picturehouse.

That trip is part of “Song From the Forest,” a languorous documentary about Mr. Sarno’s relationship with the Bayaka, a Pygmy group whose music he started documenting decades ago. (A memoir written by Mr. Sarno that has the same title as this movie has already been made into a feature film, “Oka!”)ImageLouis Sarno and his son, Samedi, in “Song From the Forest.”CreditTondowski FilmsThis nonjudgmental documentary moves between New York City and the rain forests of the Central African Republic, where Mr. Sarno primarily lives. Both places are tugs of war between abundance and lack. The director, Michael Obert, and the cinematographer, Siri Klug, keep the screen busy but hushed, honoring the sometimes parallel rhythms of each locale.What’s changing is Mr. Sarno’s relationship with the Bayaka. Once a documentarian, he’s become a de facto member of the group — Samedi is his child with a Bayaka woman — and a sort of intermediary and caretaker, checking in on people’s health and handing out money when he has it, which isn’t often. His own health is weakening, however, and he has no steady income. (His brother, shown back home in the United States, lives a comfortable life of Chesterfield sofas and carpet putting.)Much of the latter half of the film involves Mr. Sarno’s trip to New York with Samedi, including some time spent with Mr. Sarno’s college roommate Jim Jarmusch. Samedi speaks no English but is fluent in the language of childhood sulkiness. Exposed to Western excess, he sits on a bed surrounded with new toys and says (in subtitle) “I think of the things that we don’t buy and I get angry.” That’s no kind of future, either.",0,,,0

For audiences over 50, in particular, this fictional story of homegrown terrorists sprung from the 1960s counterculture should conjure complicated feelings of pride, shame, anger and regret. But along with those emotions, this earnest, well-intentioned movie elicits frustration that its story had to be packaged as a conventional, not very suspenseful fugitive thriller with a bogus Hollywood ending. Sidney Lumet’s 1988 film, “Running on Empty,” which addresses the same subject, is much more truthful and compelling. But “The Company You Keep” has its moments. The aging but still beautiful faces of its stars — especially those of Mr. Redford, Julie Christie and Susan Sarandon — convey an aura of tragic nobility. They portray former members of the Weather Underground, which plotted to blow up buildings in United States cities. Lem Dobbs’s clunky screenplay, adapted from Neil Gordon’s novel, maintains a scrupulously ethical balance in contemplating domestic terrorism, and the film gives the angriest of these left-wing radicals their say. If their rage has moderated, their basic feelings haven’t changed. A moment of reckoning arrives three decades after a Michigan bank robbery during which a security guard (an off-duty police officer) was killed by group members who disappeared after the crime. One inspiration may have been the actual robbery of a Brink’s armored car in 1981 in Nanuet, N.Y., in which three people, including two police officers, were killed.The focal character, Jim Grant (Mr. Redford), is a recently widowed public interest lawyer and solid citizen raising an 11-year-old daughter in a suburb of Albany. Jim, the movie’s moral fulcrum, is forced to confront the past when Sharon Solarz (Ms. Sarandon) turns herself in to the F.B.I. for violence committed years earlier. Ms. Sarandon, whose Bette Davis eyes still burn, gives the film’s fiercest performance as a woman inflamed by a sense of injustice. She says she would do it all again “if I didn’t have kids and old parents that I love.” On the run and narrowly avoiding arrest by the F.B.I., Jim is also desperately trying to contact his former lover, Mimi Lurie (Ms. Christie), who participated in the bank robbery, to testify that he wasn’t there. Terrence Howard, giving a clumsy performance in an underwritten role, plays the Javert-like F.B.I. field officer leading the hunt.Among the movie’s several pursuers, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf), an ambitious young reporter for an Albany newspaper, is the most persistent. With his job on the line, he ferrets out that Jim is actually Nick Sloan, a former Weather Underground member who adopted his new identity in 1979. Ben, far from being a dedicated seeker of truth and justice, is a smug, arrogant manipulator who exploits his connection with Diana (the underused Anna Kendrick), a college hookup who now works for the F.B.I., to gain privileged information. Against the orders of his demanding editor (Stanley Tucci), he travels to Ann Arbor, Mich., to interview the retired police officer (Brendan Gleeson) who led the investigation of the original robbery.“The Company You Keep” is not kind to the ailing newspaper business. If Ben is meant to represent a quintessential bright young journalist, Mr. LaBeouf makes him an obnoxious, unscrupulous troublemaker out for personal glory. Jim’s cat-and-mouse game with the F.B.I. after his true identity is revealed lacks visceral momentum, partly because of Mr. Redford’s diminished agility in his mid-70s and partly because the chases are staged so lackadaisically. Along the way, he deposits his daughter at the New York apartment of his sympathetic brother, Daniel (Chris Cooper). Seeking news of Mimi’s whereabouts, he visits other former activists, who include Billy (Stephen Root), now a hippie organic farmer; Donal (Nick Nolte), who owns a lumberyard; and Jed (Richard Jenkins, excellent as ever), a pacifist college professor whose resentment of those who embraced violence still simmers.When Mimi finally appears, she delivers a searing tirade that reveals her rage to be undiminished. Gazing at Ms. Christie, who is still radiant at 71, stirs up complicated feelings: Her feisty Mimi, a pot dealer who lives off the grid with her partner (Sam Elliott), is no meltingly empathic dream girl, but men of a certain age may fall in love with her all over again. The movie made me wonder why there isn’t a contemporary equivalent to the widespread radicalism of the 1960s and ’70s. I think it may have to do with the information explosion, which has taught us that the balance of good and evil is pretty much the same everywhere, and that violence only begets more violence. Jim didn’t get tired of the movement, he insists at one point, saying simply, “I grew up.”“The Company You Keep” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language.",0,5132442.0,,0

Milan (Milan Mumin, of the Serbian band Love Hunters) pulls over, retrieves a guitar from his trunk and gives her a sidewalk concert. At once fantastical and gritty, this sort of uninflected street vignette sets the movie apart.Milan, a character based on Mr. Mumin’s experiences in New York, is celebrated back home but is eager for success in America. Preparing for a recording, he struggles with money and rehearsals, particularly after his band’s bass guitarist bows out. Much of the movie simply watches Milan as he drives, tapping rhythms on the steering wheel, meeting passengers both encouraging and not.The arrival of his girlfriend (Jelena Stupljanin) in New York challenges their relationship. Then there is Milan’s new bass player (Eleanor Hutchins). The pair make great music; is it something more? The film delicately illustrates how the emotions of performance and life can bleed together.Nemanja Bala and Brane Bala, brothers who wrote and directed, regard Milan’s single-minded focus on his music without judgment or romanticism; Milan may be playing for an audience of one, but that’s not the same thing as selfishness.

To judge by the recent crop of what are often sneeringly referred to as chick flicks, today’s woman wants designer threads, extravagant weddings and a generous helping of public humiliation served up with  laughs, most at her expense. Where have you gone, Thelma and Louise? Oh, right: those gun-toting runaway heroines played by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who wore old blue jeans and confidently put the moves on the men in their lives in Ridley Scott’s 1991  outlaw female fantasy, drove off the cliff at their big finish. You have been missed, ladies.I bring up Mr. Scott’s film because whenever faced with another puerile movie ostensibly about women, I play a little game called What Would Thelma and Louise Do? Consider, for instance, the scene from “He’s Just Not That Into You” in which the perennially disappointed Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) says goodnight to her first-time, last-time date, a real estate agent, Conor (Kevin Connolly). As she clings to his every diffident word, her wide eyes shining and smile as fixed as that of the Joker, Gigi comes across less like the bubbly young thing she’s meant to be and pretty much like a crazy person. She walks off and immediately calls a friend to say that the date went well. A few yards away, Conor rings another woman.What would Thelma  have done? Well, she might have bedded Conor with gusto (and no marriage plans), as she does a hitchhiker with miles of muscle played by the young Brad Pitt. (Her greatest lament: he rips her off.) And Louise? Given that her lover is played by the gruff and grown-up Michael Madsen, I like to think she wouldn’t even have bothered with Conor. (That, or shot him.) Adult women like Louise might pull a Mrs. Robinson on special occasions, though not if there’s a man like Mr. Madsen steaming up the room. But adults have become something of an endangered species in big studio movies, particularly in romantic comedies, where female desire now largely seems reserved for shoes, wedding bells and babies.These days Hollywood is taking its storybook cues from that old children’s ditty:Mary and Johnny sitting in a treeK-I-S-S-I-N-GFirst comes love, then comes marriageThen comes Mary with a baby carriageSuch is more or less the reductive case in “He’s Just Not That Into You,” which is based on an obnoxious so-called advice book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, which in turn took its inspiration from the HBO series “Sex and the City.” The book’s title refers to an episode in which Carrie’s man du jour, Berger, bluntly puts Miranda straight about a guy she’s dating. Miranda thinks she’s receiving mixed messages, but men are just not that complicated, Berger says. The guy simply isn’t interested.The movie “He’s Just Not That Into You,” directed by Ken Kwapis and written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, takes this bit from a 30-minute show and turns it into an overextended 2  hours and 12 minutes. Mostly it does this by turning Gigi simultaneously into a joke (by playing her desperation for laughs) and a victim (by playing her desperation for tears). It’s a grotesque representation of female desire, one that the appealing Ms. Goodwin can’t save from caricature. It says something about the romantic comedies coming out of Hollywood that the character Ms. Goodwin plays on the HBO series “Big Love,” the youngest wife in a polygamous Mormon marriage, is treated with far more dignity than Gigi.Despite this, there are a few nice moments, most courtesy of Jennifer Connelly, as the wife, and Scarlett Johansson, as the mistress, of an understandably gaga lawyer, Ben (Bradley Cooper), who doesn’t deserve either of them. Usually tightly wound even when she’s meant to be falling apart, Ms. Connelly cuts loose and goes (relatively) dark with her character, Janine. When she learns of her husband’s infidelity, you can see the storm — the shock, the hurt, the confusion — gathering in her face. Even better, you have no idea if Janine will break into pieces. Life has knocked her sideways, and Ms. Connolly keeps the character there for a while, inserting a bit of the unknown into the otherwise predictable proceedings.Ms. Johansson’s Anna is, of course, the designated bad girl — she’s also the woman Conor dials after his date with Gigi — but the role doesn’t stick. Ms. Johansson seems too comfortable in her own beautiful skin to pay attention to wagging fingers, particularly when they belong to a twerp like Conor, who delivers a late sermon about her commitment issues. One problem with the movie is that, aside from Ben Affleck, who plays Jennifer Aniston’s marriage-phobic boyfriend, the actors are seriously outmatched by the actresses. Justin Long, the guy from the Macintosh ads, and Ms. Goodwin are a questionable-enough match. But Ms. Johansson and Mr. Connolly, the second guy on the left in the HBO series “Entourage,” make no sense. She’s Scarlett Johansson, for goodness’ sake!It’s worth noting that in a movie ostensibly dedicated to the relationship worries of the modern (straight) woman, Anna is also the only one in the distaff batch with an active, seemingly pleasurable sex life. Most of the other women are too busy trying to land men, trying to hold on to men or ruining their relationships with men to actually have sex. (Drew Barrymore, meanwhile, pops up a few times, often surrounded by wisecracking gay men.) Imagine an action flick in which the hero spends the entire movie chasing the villain without the compensatory satisfaction of smashing his enemy to smithereens. There’s a reason action producers like Jerry Bruckheimer blow stuff up in their movies: They know what men want.“He’s Just Not That Into You” is rated PG-13 (Women strongly cautioned).

Its central concern — that Americans are inadequately informed about the corporate manipulation of the food supply — may be valid, but its reliance on cute-kiddie silliness does little to fill that void. Even children as photogenic as Mr. Seifert’s are no substitute for rigorous research.We must ignore, then, sequences like the one in which the youngsters frolic in a cornfield, dressed in the equivalent of hazmat suits, the better to understand the sources of their father’s anxieties: for example, that about 80 percent of processed food contains scientifically altered ingredients, and that most of it — contrary to the wishes of a majority of Americans — is unlabeled. Or that Monsanto and other producers of these modified goods have spent a great deal of money to ensure that things stay that way.But to the informed consumer hoping for greater elucidation, Mr. Seifert’s partisan, oversimplified survey falls short. Approaching this extremely complicated topic with the air of an innocent seeker, he barely touches on the science behind the genetically modified organisms (G.M.O.) that are introduced into the food, focusing instead on tumor-encrusted, G.M.O.-fed rats: the product of a study that has since been scientifically questioned.Visits to a vast seed vault in Norway and the Seed Savers Exchange in Iowa, while undeniably diverting, again fail to excavate the economic, social and ethical ramifications of seed patenting. And a sojourn with the Haitian farmers who pledged to burn a gift of Monsanto’s hybrid seeds leaves the complex provenance of anti-G.M.O. movements unexamined.In fairness to Mr. Seifert, that’s a lot to cram into 90 minutes. And if his not unreasonable goal is to provide a gentle, flyover alert to obliviously chowing-down citizens, then he does so without hectoring and with no small amount of charm.

SCOTT,"Review: In ‘The Salesman,’ Scenes From a Marriage in Tehran","At the beginning of “The Salesman,” Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) must evacuate their Tehran apartment. There are cracks in the walls, and the high-rise building is in danger of collapsing. That flawed edifice might stand as a kind of inverse metaphor for the film itself, which is a marvel of meticulous construction. With exquisite patience and attention to detail, Asghar Farhadi, the writer and director, builds a solid and suspenseful plot out of ordinary incidents, and packs it with rich and resonant ideas.Admirers of his earlier films — including “About Elly,” “The Past” and “A Separation,” a foreign-language Oscar winner in 2012 — will not be surprised. Mr. Farhadi has distinguished himself in his generation of Iranian filmmakers as an astute psychological realist and a fastidious storyteller. Although his films take place in a thoroughly modern, urban environment, there is something satisfyingly old-fashioned about his approach to contemporary life, an understated belief in the ethical value of addressing the complexities of experience through the clarity and subtlety of narrative art.[See where to stream Asghar Farhadi’s dramas at Watching, The New York Times’s film and TV recommendation site.]Rana and Emad, a childless married couple who look to be in their mid-30s, are both actors, members of a theater company engaged in a production of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman.” Onstage, they play the Lomans, Willy and Linda, whose lower-middle-class American world is made to look both familiar and exotic. Some of the play’s sexual frankness has been blunted by Iranian government censors — in a pivotal scene, Willy’s mistress shows up in his hotel room wearing a hat and a belted red raincoat, rather than a nightgown — and its themes of striving and sacrifice seem distant from Rana and Emad’s life. Though they are not wealthy, the fact that they “work in culture” gives them a certain cachet, and they sometimes radiate a quiet sense of superiority in interactions with neighbors and acquaintances.The ghost of Willy Loman nonetheless hovers over “The Salesman,” suggesting an interpretive puzzle. The choice of this particular play-within-the-film can’t be arbitrary, but its meaning is not immediately apparent. For most of its running time, the movie seems occupied with its own dramatic issues, principally the aftermath of a shocking and apparently inexplicable act of violence.The apartment that Emad and Rana move into — thanks to the generosity of a colleague — isn’t actually haunted, but like many films about real estate “The Salesman” is to some extent a horror movie. The previous tenant was a single woman with a young child, and the stuff she left behind is more than just annoying clutter. It’s a collection of clues to an unacknowledged mystery, haunting traces of an invisible life.That life invades the couple’s household with shocking force. Rana is assaulted in the shower, and her attacker vanishes, leaving behind his pickup truck. The crime reveals tensions and fissures within her marriage, and also beyond it. Rana, whose head was injured in the attack — other possible traumas are left implicit — is terrified and distraught, but Emad seems more concerned with the injury to his own manhood. The absence of the police suggests a lack of trust in official authority so complete that it is scarcely worth mentioning. Emad’s search for answers, and for something like justice, turns him into a reluctant vigilante, and “The Salesman” is unsparing in its portrayal of the moral emptiness of personal vengeance.It is in the midst of this painful tale of crime and punishment that the spirit of Willy Loman makes its improbable, powerful and surprisingly literal return. “The Salesman” is about trust and honor, about violence against women in a patriarchal society, about the woe that is in marriage, but it is also about death, a salesman and the hidden brutality of class. Not since Pedro Almodóvar’s “All About My Mother,” which brilliantly re-engineered “A Streetcar Named Desire,” has a classic of the American stage been put to such ingenious cinematic use. Mr. Farhadi’s control is astonishing, as is the discipline of the actors. Their final scenes are at once riveting and hard to watch. Attention, as someone once said, must be paid.",1,11067.0,1223387.0,0

Harold, the storyboard artist husband, and Lillian, the film researcher wife, were a prolific team whose careers are being profiled in Daniel Raim’s documentary “Harold and Lillian: A Hollywood Love Story.”Through charming animated sketches and interviews with the couple and some of their friends, like Mel Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola and Danny DeVito, the documentary reflects on the couple’s work together — often with Mrs. Michelson’s findings inspiring her husband’s art.Mr. Michelson, who died in 2007, climbed the industry ladder as a storyboard artist, eventually becoming an art director and production designer. Not wanting to stay at home, Mrs. Michelson volunteered at a studio library and became a sought-after film researcher.Their behind-the-scenes influence on filmmakers was far-reaching. Mr. Michelson’s storyboards show sketched versions of memorable scenes, like the parting of the Red Sea in “The Ten Commandments” and Anne Bancroft’s raised leg overshadowing Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate.” Mrs. Michelson excitedly recalls interviewing women at Canter’s Deli in Los Angeles about traditional costumes for “Fiddler on the Roof” and questioning a drug kingpin for “Scarface.”The stories are told out of order to make room for personal tangents, including the challenges of raising an autistic son in the 1960s. Like flipping through misplaced leaves in a photo book, the documentary maintains a free-flowing tone as it uncovers the work that went into creating some of the indelible scenes in Hollywood history.",1,,,0

Soon, they’re slobbering frantically through a cracked-open door as Djuna tries to resist her vampiric urge to inhale his plasma. Like the good guys on “True Blood,” Djuna and her crowd have sworn off humans and drink only blood substitutes — sort of like the vampire equivalent of veganism.Luckily, Paolo — working the personality and smarts of a gravestone — can’t wait to become a creature of the night, especially as his transformation involves breathy sex and plenty of chains. All goes swimmingly until Djuna’s naughty sister, Mimi (Roxane Mesquida), shows up to seduce Paolo and wake up the audience. Mimi is the kind of vampire who picks up witless take-aways at underground clubs and discards the empties on the sidewalk. In other words, she’s fun.More focused on philosophy than feeding, “Kiss” marries a mash-up of undead clichés (I know, let’s have another lingering shot of the moon!) to hilariously stilted conversations. In the movie’s best scene, Mimi tempts a preachy vampire actress with a juicy blond teenager. If you want to push a bloodsucker off the wagon, find her a virgin and stand back.",0,9167.0,,0

As the comedian and outspoken nonbeliever Bill Maher travels the world, interviewing Christians, Jews and Muslims in the facetiously funny documentary “Religulous,” you begin to wonder if there might be two subspecies of humans.The skeptical minority to which Mr. Maher belongs constitutes 16 percent of the American population, he says, citing a survey. For many of them, including Mr. Maher, the tenets of Christianity, Judaism and Islam (Eastern and African religions are ignored) are dangerous fairy tales and myths that have incited barbarous purges and holy wars that are still being fought. A talking snake? A man who lived inside a fish? These are two of Mr. Maher’s favorite biblical images offered up for ridicule.The majority of Americans, however, embrace some form of blind faith. But because that faith by its very nature requires a leap into irrationality, it is almost impossible to explain or to defend in rational terms.Mr. Maher has already established his position as an agnostic in his HBO comedy series, “Real Time With Bill Maher.” A recent clash on the program with his frequent guest the blogger and author Andrew Sullivan, who is a Roman Catholic, illustrated how believers and those who doubt might as well be from different planets. They can argue with each other in fairly reasonable voices about politics, but not about faith.“Religulous” is directed by Larry Charles, whose credits include “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan” and many episodes of HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” And the movie has the same loose, on-the-road structure as “Borat.” Much of Mr. Maher’s film is extremely funny in a similarly irreverent, offhanded way. Some true believers  — at least those who have a sense of humor about their faith  —  may even be amused. But most will not.In a small journalistic coup Mr. Maher interviews a Roman Catholic priest in front of the Vatican, who laughingly agrees with him that the fundamental teachings of the Catholic Church are nonsense that are not to be taken literally. Mr. Maher, unfortunately, doesn’t press him on why he wears priestly vestments and presumes to exert religious authority.Although theologians and scientists are interviewed in the film, they are fleeting presences in a documentary that doesn’t pretend to be a serious cultural or scientific exploration of the roots of faith. Because Mr. Maher adopts the attitude of an inquiring reporter instead of a pundit, his contempt for organized religion isn’t as pointed in the movie as it is in his television monologues.His strategy is to coax most of those subjects who are true believers to appear foolish as they offer stumbling, inarticulate responses to his friendly interrogations. The majority of his subjects are easy targets. One such sitting duck is José Luis de Jesús Miranda, a nattily dressed Miami preacher who declares that he is the second coming of Christ and claims that his Growing in Grace ministry has 100,000 followers. Like the fulminating televangelists whose ministries the film glosses over, he comes across as a greedy, self-satisfied charlatan with a fondness for gold.When Mr. Maher asks  Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat  and fervent evangelical Christian, why faith is good, he stumbles for an answer. Returning later to Senator Pryor, Mr. Maher suggests that many evangelicals look forward to  the end of the world, when it is  prophesied that Jesus will return. The senator doesn’t dispute him.John Westcott, a former homosexual who is now married and the  director of Exchange Ministries in Winter Park, Fla., an organization whose mission is to reorient sexuality, can only smile when Mr. Maher reminds him that Jesus never addressed the subject of homosexuality. At a Christian theme park where the passion of Christ is re-enacted in a tacky musical pageant, the actor playing Jesus compares the Holy Trinity to the three states of water: liquid, ice and vapor.When “Religulous” turns from evangelical Christianity to Judaism and Islam, its tone becomes uncertain and its rhythm choppy. An attitude of glib condescension is inadequate to address clashing religions that have turned the Middle East into an ideological cauldron. Jihadism and Orthodox Judaism are red-hot topics that Mr. Maher addresses  too sketchily to convey the same authority he brings to Christianity.Ultimately, “Religulous” turns into a thunderous warning about the future, complete with apocalyptic images of stampeding armies and mushroom clouds issued by Mr. Maher, standing in the ruins of Megiddo, the Israeli site from which the Book of Revelation says Armageddon will originate. Secular humanists, agnostics and atheists should rise up and make themselves heard, he declares. Instead of faith, he emphasizes, we should consider doubt.“Religulous” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Take the writer-director John Sayles (“Lone Star”), who got his start in movies writing trash classics like “Piranha” and “Alligator.” Now the director Jordan Rubin, a former writer for Comedy Central’s “Crank Yankers,” and Evan Astrowsky, a producer of Eli Roth’s horror film “Cabin Fever,” pool their talents for “Zombeavers,” an intermittently diverting stew of low-budget effects and potty-mouth humor. Unsurprisingly, its writers and soundtrack composers, the brothers Jon and Al Kaplan, wrote the music for Syfy’s “Piranhaconda” and “Dinocroc vs. Supergator.” (More intriguingly, they also created “Silence!,” the stage parody of “The Silence of the Lambs.”)Also unsurprising is the premise: Six young, attractive archetypes — sensitive Sam (Hutch Dano); brainy Mary (Rachel Melvin); randy Zoe (Cortney Palm); goofy Buck (Peter Gilroy); sexy Jenn (Lexi Atkins); and alpha male Tommy (Jake Weary) — take up residence in (not again!) a cabin in the woods. A nearby chemical spill from a truck has seeped into the local ecosystem, resulting in a legion of white-eyed, bucktoothed, flat-tailed undead. These ravenous critters chew through everything: walls, floorboards and body limbs, this last giving birth to human variations on the same.Abundant but cheesy gore, a frenetic pace and a self-amused air from the filmmakers pervade the proceedings.

In some scenes, he looks crushed and lost, like a wadded scrap of paper that fell short of the garbage bin. It soon becomes clear why. His character, Jim Bennett, hit the literary jackpot years ago with a well-received first and only published novel. Now Jim splits his time between teaching college — say hello to Professor Wahlberg — and betting and losing at gaming tables, some in underworld parlors around a Los Angeles that’s been Michael Mann-ed into a smear of throbbing color and would-be existential dread.“The Gambler” is based on the terrific lowdown and gritty 1974 movie of the same title starring James Caan. That film was beautifully directed by Karel Reisz from James Toback’s script about his experience as a gambler and college lecturer; the new one was directed by Rupert Wyatt from a screenplay by William Monahan, who also wrote Martin Scorsese’s Academy Award windfall “The Departed.” Without a script in hand, it’s tough to tell how significant a contribution a writer makes to a movie, what was retained or changed from page to screen. All that’s clear in this “Gambler” is that almost everything that makes the original so pleasurably idiosyncratic, from its daft ideas to the peekaboo bear rug spread over Mr. Caan’s often-bared chest, has been expunged from the remake. A change in name is the least of it but is symptomatic of the material’s bowdlerization. Mr. Caan’s gambler is Axel Freed and the scion of a wealthy Jewish New York family. (The name suggests that Mr. Toback was familiar with Dostoyevsky’s short autobiographical novel “The Gambler,” in which the protagonist is named Alexei.) Recast as an ethnically generic poor little rich boy, Mr. Wahlberg’s Jim Bennett lives in Los Angeles, mostly after dark in illegal gambling dens where Asian and black habitués serve as decoration. In one of the remake’s better touches, Jim and some other gamblers stroll into these joints with satchels and briefcases stuffed with cash, like salarymen purposefully marching off to work. Gambling isn’t his profession, though it is his calling, habit and love.The story mostly involves Jim’s consuming passion with gambling and, in a quasi-Freudian move, learning to transfer that libidinous energy to a dubiously healthier object, in this case one of his young students, Amy (an underused Brie Larson). Mr. Monahan may have lifted the teacher-student liaison from Dostoyevsky’s biography and novelist’s relationship with a much younger woman. That’s moderately interesting, but it doesn’t mean anything for Amy (or Ms. Larson), who does little more than look intently at Jim when he’s jumping around the lecture hall or laying down some heavy thoughts. Ms. Larson holds your eyes and interest, but she’s as ornamental as the stick figure played by Lauren Hutton in the 1974 film.Mr. Wyatt’s direction is smooth, although he’s more confident, and the movie more convincing, when he goes for baroque with the story’s excesses, like cutting loose with the cartoonish villains played by Alvin Ing, Jessica Lange, Michael Kenneth Williams and John Goodman. The problem is that Jim (and Mr. Wahlberg) never joins the fun. A congenitally likable screen presence, Mr. Wahlberg handles the movie’s streaming words like the rapper he once was, and he sometimes cocks an eyebrow as if acknowledging the absurdity of it all. Mostly, his character is sad, sincere and heavy, and his performance is, too, even when Jim whips out some eyeglasses the first time he enters his classroom. When Marilyn Monroe pulled that kind of stunt it was comedy gold, but it just makes Jim and Mr. Wahlberg look silly. What’s mostly missing from “The Gambler” is a sense of why Jim is so insistent on squandering his money, privilege and patrimony. In a letter to a friend, Dostoyevsky wrote that the main thing about his gambler “is that all his vitality, his strength, his impetus, his courage, have gone into roulette.” The character “is a poet in his own way, but ashamed of this poetry because he is profoundly conscious that it is unworthy, although the necessity of risk redeems him in his own eyes.” You can understand why Mr. Reisz chose Mr. Caan, who was a sexual beast on-screen back in the day and who makes you feel the intensity of the character’s need to gamble, to chance it all so that he can win, a risk that can lead to something like grace. Here, though winning isn’t everything — it’s hardly anything. “The Gambler” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Vice, inherently.",0,18884667.0,33680992.0,1

In this  French variation of the fable of the prodigal son, Antoine reluctantly returns to his rural hometown after 10 years in the  big city  when his father (Daniel Duval) has a heart attack.Someone has to run the family’s grocery store while his father recovers, and Antoine’s unhappily married older brother,  François (Stéphan Guérin-Tillié), who stayed by their parents when Antoine fled, insists the time has come for Antoine to shoulder some responsibility. While their mother (Jeanne Goupil) has minded the store, their father has operated a  van selling produce and staples to the area’s mostly elderly inhabitants.This small gem of a film, a surprise hit in France, is the second feature directed by Éric Guirado, who prepared for it by filming portraits of traveling tradesmen in southern and central France. For 18 months he focused on mobile grocers in Corsica, the Pyrenees and the Alps. As the movie affectionately observes the gruff, self-reliant customers, some of whom hobble to the van  on canes, it has a documentarylike realism. You grow to respect these hardy, weather-beaten people who lived their whole lives close to the land.Antoine brings to his customers the same surly, put-upon attitude with which he confronted his superiors in urban restaurants where he held and lost a succession of waiter’s jobs. Brusque and detached, he repeatedly offends old folks whom his father had befriended on his rounds. Even when they voice their disgruntlement, Antoine doesn’t seem to notice.It is only when he is joined by Claire (Clotilde Hesme), a free-spirited friend visiting from  the city, that his attitude begins to soften. Although Claire is spending most of her time taking a correspondence course in hopes of being accepted into college in Spain, she enjoys riding around the countryside. After she suggests painting the white van in circus colors and calling it the Flying Grocery, the drudgery becomes more of a lark. As Claire and Antoine spend time together, their simmering, barely acknowledged attraction comes to a sudden boil, complicating both their lives.“The Grocer’s Son,” which Mr. Guirado wrote with Florence Vignon, captures family dynamics with an acuteness that reveals decades of stored grievances. Antoine can hardly stand to be in the presence of a father who conveys contempt and disappointment in every suspicious gaze. The movie signals that temperamentally father and son are two of a kind. Relations between Antoine and François, who is deeply depressed and can’t bring himself to tell his parents that his wife has left him, are equally tense. The mother, who loves her family, tries to keep the peace without rankling anyone.Slowly Antoine warms to the rural environment he turned his back on and, almost despite himself, begins to feel a tentative happiness and community spirit. Mr. Cazalé’s subtle performance makes his transformation entirely believable and prevents this cautiously upbeat movie from curdling into a sentimental advertisement for the simple life.His performance is matched by Paul Crauchet’s and Liliane Rovère’s sharp thumbnail portraits of two regular customers. Mr. Crauchet’s Clément, an increasingly frail widowed farmer who trades fresh eggs for staples but begins to forget exactly where the eggs are stored, is an endearing old codger who has accepted that the end is near. Ms. Rovère’s Lucienne, a haughty, self-sufficient woman with a past, is softhearted under a prickly exterior and has a wicked, deadpan sense of humor. After an accident in which she is knocked to the ground by the hood of the van, she reappears on its next visit wearing a metal mixing bowl on her head.“The Grocer’s Son” is a triumphant accumulation of such quirky, perfectly observed details.",1,,192572.0,0

O. SCOTT,Might Makes Him Mr. Right,"“Who are you, Mister?” a young woman asks Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), and it’s a question that recurs, not always quite so politely, throughout the movie that bears Reacher’s name. He may be an elusive individual with a sketchy background — ex-military, no fixed address, a single shirt to his name — but as an archetype he is easy enough to recognize. He is a cousin of Shane and Caine (from the old “Kung Fu” television series) and Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name: a paladin without portfolio who travels from town to town, dispensing righteous violence and hard-boiled aphorisms.“It’s just what guys like me do,” Reacher says wearily at one point, though he could say it at just about any point.Guys like him are mythical creatures, fantasy figures who dispense rough justice when civic institutions fail. Part comic-book superhero, part Old West vigilante and wholly preposterous, Reacher is far less enigmatic than he or anyone else in the movie thinks he is. And also less interesting.Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie and adapted from “One Shot,” the ninth in Lee Child’s series of macho best sellers, “Jack Reacher” brings its hero to Pittsburgh, where a sniper has just shot down five innocent people, including a nanny accompanying a small child, in broad daylight. The suspected shooter (Joseph Sikora) lies in a coma — after scrawling “Get Jack Reacher” on a pad in lieu of a confession — with a seemingly airtight case against him. Shell casings, fingerprints at the scene, security-camera video, all the usual stuff that disciplined television crime-show viewers will recognize as solid circumstantial evidence.But the man’s lawyer, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), hires Reacher anyway, possibly because she thinks he might keep her client off death row, and possibly because she, like every other woman in (and presumably beyond) the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is made weak in the knees by Reacher’s off-the-charts sexual magnetism.Helen also has some daddy issues, mainly that her daddy (Richard Jenkins) is the district attorney prosecuting the presumed killer. He and the lead detective on the case (David Oyelowo) are obviously too sure of themselves to be trusted, and even before we meet a character known as the Zec (Werner Herzog, whose casting raises a brief film-geek frisson) we know that the poor fellow in the coma is a patsy. We also know, just because of the kind of guy Jack Reacher is, that the body count is sure to rise.And so “Jack Reacher” lumbers through a series of beatings, shootings and bludgeonings on its way to a climactic, not terribly surprising showdown. There is a pretty good car chase and a lot of very bad dialogue. Mr. McQuarrie, on his second outing as a director (his screenplays include “The Usual Suspects” and “Valkyrie”), seems more suited to action scenes than to the ostensibly simpler task of filming people talking. Nearly every conversation is stilted and lame, laden with the kind of repartee that might strike you as witty if you had no sense of humor.The self-confident, supercompetent Reacher is a character Mr. Cruise could play in his sleep, which is pretty much what he does. Ms. Pike seems a bit more agitated, perhaps because she is too refined an actress for the kind of pulpy sincerity the movie requires. She tries very hard to make sense of Helen’s emotions and motives, which is a hopeless task, since the character is an inexplicable collage of empathy, ambition and neediness, on hand to awaken Reacher’s chivalrous impulses and to quiver with confused desire whenever he is in the room.Apart from the car chase, the only real fun in “Jack Reacher” comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall, called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine. They enliven the movie’s atmosphere of weary brutality for a few moments, but they also call attention to the dullness of their dramatic surroundings.“Jack Reacher” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

At least that’s the case in “After the Storm,” a new film from the writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda. Tall and lean, Mr. Abe has handsome features — floppy dark hair across his forehead, prominent cheekbones and a long jaw line. But here, playing Ryota Shinoda, a onetime literary sensation fallen on hard times professionally and personally, he also has lines around and bags under his eyes, a perpetual five o’clock shadow and a downcast mouth. He looks as if he could be trouble.As it happens, he is trouble mostly for himself, although he manages to irritate his ex-wife, Kyoko (Yoko Maki), because of his inability to pay child support for their son, Shingo (Taiyo Yoshizawa), and frustrate his sister (Satomi Kobayashi), whom he hits up for money with grim regularity. Ryota, having never followed up on his award-winning first novel, now works as a private detective. (The novel is another thing his sister is annoyed about; “Don’t you dare write about us again,” she snaps at one point.) It’s a gig that gives him many opportunities to alter the calibration of his moral compass — in one scene he tries to talk a subject of an investigation into buying the evidence he’s gathered against her. He also spies on his ex-wife, and is less than thrilled to learn that her unctuous new boyfriend has bought Shingo a snazzy baseball mitt.Ryota’s aging mother, Yoshiko (Kirin Kiki), loves him unconditionally, though, and she doesn’t give him a hard time when she walks in after he’s clearly been rifling through her apartment, trying to find a family heirloom to pawn. She lives alone (the family’s patriarch has died, presumably recently) in a Tokyo apartment complex far removed from the bustling city we are accustomed to seeing in Japanese films, or films about Japan. The neighborhood isn’t showy, but it’s a pleasant, relatively tree-lined environment, and its older residents get together in informal groups to listen to and discuss Beethoven. Nevertheless, Yoshiko is a little preoccupied with what she sees as the approaching end of her life.As Ryota scrambles to somehow get ahead, Kyoko seems befuddled by her own resentments and prospects for the future. Meanwhile, the young Shingo bristles at a potential stepfather who offers baseball coaching along the lines of “To be the hero, you have to get a hit” even though the situation under consideration calls for drawing a walk. At one point, Ryota, Yoshiko, Kyoko and Shingo all have to pull together during an overnight typhoon that strands them in Yoshiko’s apartment, which is cozy and conspicuously lacking in privacy.Mr. Kore-eda, whose most noteworthy family dramas include “Still Walking” (2009) and “Like Father, Like Son” (2014), works in a quiet cinematic register, and the slightest error in tone could upend the whole enterprise. Slow-paced, sad, rueful and sometimes warmly funny, “After the Storm” is one of his sturdiest, and most sensitive, constructions. “I really just can’t understand how things turned out like this,” one character says while sitting out the storm.As perplexed as they are about how they got into such a mess, the characters are nonetheless obliged to move forward as some kind of family, and the story patiently brings them closer to a reconciliation with that fact. Beautifully acted by a great cast (particularly Mr. Abe, who can make a sonata of frustration out of burrowing into a stale frozen treat with a spoon), “After the Storm” brings this intimate struggle to moving life. It’s a film that sticks with you.",1,270210.0,,0

SCOTT,"Review: ‘The Mummy,’ With Tom Cruise, Deserves a Quick Burial","You’ve no doubt been told that if you can’t say something nice, you shouldn’t say anything at all. If I followed that rule, I’d be unemployed. But still. There’s no great joy in accentuating the negative. So I will say this in favor of “The Mummy”: It is 110 minutes long. That is about 20 minutes shorter than “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” about which I had some unkind things to say a couple of weeks ago. Simple math will tell you how much better this movie is than that one. If you have no choice but to see it — a circumstance I have trouble imagining — you can start in on your drinking that much sooner.“The Mummy” begins with a supposed Egyptian proverb to the effect that “we” never really die; “we” assume new forms and keep right on living. I’m not an Egyptologist, but it seems just as likely that those words were lifted from a movie-studio strategy memo. Universal, lacking a mighty superhero franchise, has gone into its intellectual-property files, which are full of venerable monsters, and created a commercial agglomeration it calls the Dark Universe. “The Mummy” is the first of a slew — a swarm? a pestilence? — of features reviving those old creatures, including the one from the Black Lagoon. We can also look forward to new visits from Frankenstein’s monster and his bride, the Wolf Man and the Invisible Man, among others.It sounds like fun. The “Mummy” reboot from 1999, directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, was kind of fun. Monster movies frequently are. This one, directed by Alex Kurtzman and starring Tom Cruise, is an unholy mess. Mr. Cruise plays Nick Morton, a jaunty military daredevil with a sideline in antiquities theft and a nutty sidekick (Jake Johnson). When a caper goes wrong, the two call in an airstrike on an Iraqi village — I guess that’s something people are doing for kicks nowadays — and a mysterious tomb is unearthed. Luckily, an archaeologist, Dr. Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), is on hand to explain what it’s all about and also to affirm Nick’s heterosexuality.Long story short: An ancient evil has been unleashed upon the world. Its agent is a long-buried pharaoh’s daughter, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who is covered with mysterious tattoos and convinced that Nick is her secret lover, or the god of death, or both. She gets inside his head, which is awkward both because he’s kind of sweet on Jenny and because it’s such an empty place. Ahmanet also has a retinue of zombielike minions at her disposal, who rampage through England on their way to a meeting with Russell Crowe.Mr. Crowe plays another fixture in the Dark Universe, a label that strikes me as a bit of an exaggeration. Dim Universe would be more accurate, with respect both to the murky, ugly images and to the intellectual capacities of the script, written and conceived by a bunch of people who are capable of better. The old black-and-white Universal horror movies were a mixed bag, but they had some imagination. They could be creepy or campy, weird or lyrical. “The Mummy” gestures — or flails — in a number of directions but settles into the dreary 21st-century action-blockbuster template. There’s chasing and fighting, punctuated by bouts of breathless explaining and a few one-liners that an archaeologist of the future might tentatively decode as jokes.There is a vague notion that Nick is struggling with dueling impulses toward good and evil, acting out his version of the Jekyll-Hyde predicament. A more interesting movie might have involved a similar struggle within Ahmanet, but a more interesting movie was not on anybody’s mind.It will be argued that this one was made not for the critics but for the fans. Which is no doubt true. Every con game is played with suckers in mind.",0,,80101125.0,0

In “Tiny Times 2,” the writer and director Guo Jingming continues his adaptation of his coming-of-age trilogy about four young women, besties at least from high school, as they make their way in today’s careerist, consumerist Shanghai. “Sisterhood is powerful,” it turns out, translates easily to Mandarin.The first “Tiny Times” introduced Lily (Amber Kuo), the sleek, wealthy, all-business mama hen; Nan Xiang (Bea Hayden), the multitalented artist; Ruby, the chubby, man-hungry one (Hsieh Yi-lin); and Lin Xiao (Mini Yang), the narrator and “regular” girl. Sort of a young “Sex and the City” without the sex. (The city, though, may be the sex, a dazzling Oz of gleaming architecture and luxury brands.)“Tiny Times” borrowed heavily from “The Devil Wears Prada,” with Lin Xiao proving herself as an intern for a demanding fashion magazine editor; the twist is that her boss is a man, Gong Ming (Rhydian Vaughan), à la the Mr. Big of Carrie Bradshaw’s acquaintance, except he looks like Tom Cruise.The first installment did so well in China this summer that Mr. Guo expedited the sequel’s release. Starting as the four graduate from college, this episode is a soap opera of betrayals and breakups, misunderstandings and forgiveness, disease and death, boardroom politics and corporate takeovers. You know, the 20s.As entertainment, this is vintage potboiler fare. But the movie is also revealing as fantasy, an artifact of 21st-century China’s youth culture transfixed by its rising fortunes and Western ways.",0,,,1

There hasn’t been a Jewish basketball star in the National Basketball Association for half a century, but when the sport was young, it was the children of European Jewish immigrants who took it up and dominated it.“The First Basket,” a functional (if narrowly interesting) history lesson by the filmmaker David Vyorst, recollects the rich history of Jewish participation in basketball, starting with its embrace in the thriving immigrant community on the Lower East Side of New York and ending with a look at the continuing popularity of the game in Israel.Using a wealth of archival material, as well as testaments from former players and coaches, Mr. Vyorst shows how basketball functioned among Jews as both a vehicle for cultural assimilation and a means of reformulating Jewish identity, which prized the scholar, not the athlete, as the masculine ideal.THE FIRST BASKETOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by David Vyorst; narrated by Peter Riegert; director of photography, Gary Griffin; edited by Carol Slatkin; music by Roberto Juan Rodriguez; released by Laemmle/Zeller Films.

Magnificent in its thoroughness and nuance, this dense, multifaceted study of Somali piracy really needs to settle down.Even calmed, however, the film’s bounty of knowledgeable interviews, dramatic re-enactments and found footage from multiple sources — including cellphone and audio recordings of hostage negotiations — is a lot to take in. Using the 2008 hijacking of a Danish vessel in the Gulf of Aden as a frame, the director, Thymaya Payne, conducts an admirably evenhanded investigation into the causes and consequences of high-seas high jinks.Allowing room for competing theories (with Noam Chomsky chiming in for the little guy), Mr. Payne, who spent four years researching this project, gives voice to shipping executives, pirates and former hostages alike. Pungent comments from journalists and piracy historians add perspective and analysis, branding pirates “the midwives of globalization” and widening the net of culpability in surprising ways.Meanwhile the subjects of all this talking, having traded tricorn hats for swaths of fabric and cutlasses for Kalashnikovs, remain difficult to catch and expensive to prosecute. Translators like Ishmael Ali, the weary Somali camel herder at the center of the Danish hostage negotiations, can find that playing frontman for criminals takes an emotional toll. By the end of the film, thanks to Mr. Payne’s unbiased efforts, you may sympathize more than you expect.",0,,,0

Michael Stevens’s laudatory documentary trumpets all these qualities, engaging in the very sort of mythologizing that its subject might have punctured in his heyday.It would be hard to pinpoint that heyday in a career sustained from the Depression nearly till his death, soon after Sept. 11, 2001, including over half a century at The Washington Post. Mr. Stevens’s film is partly a Herblock history of America, with the highlights being his stances on McCarthyism and Nixon. Further wisdom is delivered, unsettlingly or cornily, by a dead ringer for Herblock (played by Alan Mandell), clad in a periwinkle sweater and sitting in a cluttered office.It’s fortunate that the cartoons on display are such instantly satisfying works of popular genius, because, despite its subject, “Herblock” shows how even an edifying talking-heads documentary bumps up against the limitations of the format. Even as we admire Herblock’s gut sense, informed not by reflexive cynicism but by a big heart for his country, all these encomiums grow wearying to watch.

Add the magnificent Christine Baranski to the mix and “A Bad Moms Christmas,” while still a slog of base sight gags and lazy profanity, becomes marginally more bearable.Only marginally, given that this pitiful follow-up to last year’s “Bad Moms” is even less able to distinguish between crass and comedic. (To the writers and directors, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, they’re apparently the same thing.) Adding an extra schmear of bad mothers, the plot finds our three originals (Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Ms. Hahn) buckling under the stress of Christmas and appalled when their own mothers (played by Ms. Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) show up for the holiday.The new arrivals, complete with a single neurosis apiece — the grifter, the clinger, the perfectionist — infantilize and infuriate their daughters, who vow to “take back Christmas.” This rebellion, staged in raucous montages in a mall and elsewhere, involves getting plastered at the food court, terrorizing Santa with cleavage and assaulting strangers and one another. Worst of all is an extended sequence where Ms. Hahn’s character gives a Brazilian wax to a prodigiously endowed male client, who verbally guides us from stem to stern with disgusting specificity. At the same time, the movie’s presumably normally gifted men are as superfluous to the proceedings as a thesaurus in the writers’ room.Set in a suburban nightmare of oppressive expectations, “A Bad Moms Christmas” ends with its own sequel already cued up.“I have heart cancer,” Ms. Hines’s character says at one point in a vain attempt to halt her daughter’s complaints.

Upon hearing a particularly great tune, he would ask two questions: “Who wrote it?” and “Is he or she still alive?”At that time, so many of the writers and players and singers were indeed still alive. Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer referred to in Mr. Wenders’s movie as “the Cuban Nat King Cole,” was making a meager living shining shoes a few blocks down the street from the studio where Mr. Cooder and Juan de Marcos González were working on what would become the 1997 album “Buena Vista Social Club.” That record, and Mr. Wenders’s subsequent film, made international stars out of Mr. Ferrer and several other Cuban musicians who had thought time and the world had passed them by.“Buena Vista Social Club: Adios,” directed by Lucy Walker (and of which Mr. Wenders, among others, is an executive producer) is both an exemplary sequel and a vital, informative companion piece. It not only chronicles the late-life careers of the “Buena Vista” stars, many of whom have since died. But it also tells some painful and fascinating back stories, and insists on putting the music in its social and historical contexts.Mr. Wenders’s film didn’t do much of that; it was content to be a kind of hangout movie, capturing musicians playing dominoes while awaiting their turns at the microphone. “Adios” shows furious arguments at sound checks and reveals the ambivalence with which some of the musicians viewed newfound fame. It’s not as poetic or immediately enjoyable as the first film. But it is tougher and more analytical, with real challenges embedded in its pleasures.",1,118253.0,,0

SCOTT,"Review: In ‘Two Men in Town,’ a Parolee Is Hounded by a Cop","Paroled after serving 18 years in prison for the killing of a sheriff’s deputy, William Garnett tries to build a normal life in a small border town in the New Mexico desert. William, who converted to Islam in the penitentiary, buys a used motorcycle, finds a job at a ranch and begins a romance. His peace is threatened by a grudge-holding sheriff and by an old friend who wants to drag William back into his criminal ways. His parole officer does what she can to head off what seems like an inevitably tragic turn of events.William’s struggle is at the center of “Two Men in Town,” a somber, slow-moving drama directed by Rachid Bouchareb. The film, a remake of a 1973 French policier starring Alain Delon and Jean Gabin, is above all a showcase for a superb group of actors. Brenda Blethyn as the parole officer and Harvey Keitel the sheriff are the bickering faces of legal authority, each one a prickly blend of toughness and compassion. Luis Guzmán as the bad old buddy and Dolores Heredia as the kind new love interest are expectedly excellent. Above all, Forest Whitaker, as shrewd and graceful as ever, conveys William’s infinite sorrow and simmering anger.The desert landscapes are gorgeously shot by Yves Cape, but “Two Men in Town” never seems to fully inhabit its setting. Nor does the schematic, occasionally clumsy story do justice to the skills of the cast. Mr. Bouchareb, whose previous films include the sweeping World War II drama “Days of Glory,” is a methodical, thoughtful director, and this movie’s best moments find William in solitude or at prayer. But neither his inner turmoil nor his conflicts with the people around him come into sharp enough relief, and the gravity of his situation never fully takes hold.“Two Men in Town” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Even so, what the publicity notes are pleased to call a “disconcerting narrative structure” is far from the only issue with “Archaeology of a Woman,” Sharon Greytak’s confounding blend of long-ago murder and present-day dementia.Claiming the center is Margaret (Sally Kirkland), a former newspaper columnist in upstate New York whose declining mental condition is signaled by, among other things, the desire to unbutton her shirt when law enforcement is around. A similar lust for authority figures plagues her daughter, Kate (Victoria Clark), who enlivens her train ride to work by engaging in a bathroom quickie with an off-duty cop.Sexual preferences established, the story flits backward and forward, as Margaret experiences disturbing memories and upsets the old biddies at the senior center by dishing their dirt to anyone who’ll listen. Moments like this, smack in the middle of Ms. Kirkland’s scene-stealing wheelhouse, are weirdly golden. Less so is the murder mystery plot that unfolds alongside, identified by news reports of body bits resurfacing from a 30-year-old crime. Who is the old geezer lurking in Margaret’s garden? Why does she spend so much time in her underwear?Burdened by a ludicrous script and messy direction, Ms. Kirkland — a headstrong veteran performer who is nothing if not game — has proved that she can play this kind of role in her sleep.

But then it’s as if Bart Freundlich, who wrote and directed, loses confidence in the performances and decides he’d better throw in every cliché in the genre.Anthony (Taylor John Smith) is a basketball star at a private high school in New York who is good enough to be drawing interest from Cornell. The league championship game is looming, but Anthony has distractions, many of them caused by his father (Michael Shannon), whose drinking and gambling are spiraling out of control.This is stock plotting — the athlete sidetracked by domestic matters at a crucial moment — but Mr. Smith and especially Mr. Shannon sell the conceit well, aided by fine performances from Carla Gugino as Anthony’s mother and Zazie Beetz as his girlfriend. Yet just when the film seems as if it will choose the road rarely taken by movies involving sports — the subtle road, the one that doesn’t involve last-second heroics on the court or diamond or field — Mr. Freundlich veers into thudding excess.Suddenly Anthony has more than his father to worry about, and the adversity just keeps piling up, building to a ridiculously improbable climax.

He settled with his wife, child and mother at a temple in Gifu prefecture where he spends nearly all his time trying to dissuade those in danger of taking their own lives.The men and women here convey deep torment and helplessness. Mr. Nemoto occasionally asks questions, gives advice or offers reasons to live. But more often he listens, and his face registers both empathy for them and sometimes despair at his own shortcomings. “I’m sorry,” he says softly to one troubled woman as he looks away. “I’m not being much help, am I?”His nearness to their pain takes a toll. Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here.

This public space is filmed to look like a limbo dividing heaven and hell.It is where Fred Daly (Colm Meaney), a portly, middle-aged jack-of-all-trades whose hobby is repairing broken clocks and watches, and Cathal O’Regan (Colin Morgan), a 21-year-old heroin addict with cavernous cheekbones and alarmingly brown teeth, meet and team up as unlikely buddies. Homeless men reduced to living in their cars, they facetiously describe themselves as neighbors.Fred cautiously warms to Cathal after the young man takes him to the National Aquatic Center to bathe. Fred is ineligible for public assistance because, in the language of the social welfare office, he has “no fixed abode.” When Cathal assures Fred that he is in control of his addiction and doesn’t use needles, Fred, who appoints himself Cathal’s surrogate father, foolishly believes him.“Parked” has strong performances by Mr. Meaney and Mr. Morgan, but Ciaran Creagh’s skimpy screenplay fails to give either character a sufficient back story to explain his dire circumstances. It throws in an unlikely possible love interest for Fred in Juliana (Milka Ahlroth), a widowed Finnish pianist and composer whom Fred meets at a water aerobics class. As they edge toward each other, the proudly self-sufficient Fred cannot bring himself to tell Juliana that he is homeless.Cathal, viciously harassed by drug dealers to whom he owes money, is on the road to ruin. In a sickening scene he is nearly beaten to death and his vehicle destroyed. But Cathal’s manic energy and street smarts still inspire Fred to take control of his own life.

The result is “Escape From Planet Earth,” a children’s movie about space-traveling blue beings that has lots of high-flying escapades but fairly low aspirations.The film features some recognizable names doing the voice work but gives them a boilerplate story, about polar-opposite brothers on a planet named Baab who end up in a pickle on Earth. Scorch (Brendan Fraser) is the muscular, heroic type who is dispatched to various points in the universe on rescue missions, while Gary (Rob Corddry) is his somewhat nerdy brother, who assists Scorch from the safety of mission control. When Scorch is lured to Earth by a fake rescue call orchestrated by an evil human, General Shanker (William Shatner), Gary has to find courage and try to save his brother.Shanker turns out to have been tricking aliens into coming to Earth for years so he can steal their technology, and his plan for Scorch is particularly diabolical. Young viewers are unlikely to get the movie’s references to Area 51 and such, but the bigger question is whether they will warm to any of these characters, who all seem borrowed from other movies, like “Toy Story,” and lack a special spark to elevate them above the animated pack.Among the few bits just for the grown-ups in the audience is a funny 1950s-style training video that Shanker shows newly captured aliens to introduce them to Earthlings. But inserting the occasional adult gag is different from infusing a movie with multigenerational rewards throughout.And so “Escape From Planet Earth” makes a tolerable diversion for a winter’s day or evening, just not a memorable one.

The book tells the true story of a Polish couple who rescued about 300 Jews from the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust and sheltered them in their zoo.What does it say that the most stirring scenes in a movie that avoids graphic depictions of Nazi barbarism involve the heroic title character, Antonina Zabinska (Jessica Chastain), lovingly interacting with the animals in the Warsaw Zoo, which she runs with her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh)?In these tender moments, “The Zookeeper’s Wife,” directed by Niki Caro (“Whale Rider”), from an anemic screenplay by Angela Workman, shucks off its modesty and transforms into the sentimental portrait of a beautiful woman and the animals she cares for like a devoted parent. You can trust animals, but not people, she declares.Her beloved charges get more screen time than the Jews whose lives the couple saves and who mostly remain anonymous, their personal stories left untold. They creep out of hiding and convene like a ghostly family when Antonina signals them by playing the piano.The most emotional scene has nothing to do with Nazis, Jews or the Holocaust. In this surefire set piece, which feels shoehorned into the film, Antonina saves the life of a baby elephant to which she administers CPR, risking being trampled by the adorable creature’s agitated mother. Otherwise, “The Zookeeper’s Wife” plays like a medium-gloss rerun of other more gripping depictions of Nazi evil and Jewish suffering.It at least sustains a cool pictorial grandeur in its portrayal of the Nazi invasion of Poland as bombers sweep the skies and armored tanks roll into Warsaw as the city erupts in panic, its peace and quiet shattered in one horrifying instant. As bombs rain on the zoo, the frightened, confused animals run wild in the streets, and amid the chaos an elephant is shot.After the invasion, Antonina and Jan are greeted with unctuous cordiality by Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl), a suave Nazi zoologist who offers to transport the zoo’s most prized animals to Berlin for safekeeping. During their stay, he says, he plans to use them for selective breeding.To keep the zoo from being closed, the quick-witted couple come up with the idea of converting it into a hog farm, which would produce meat to feed the German soldiers. The animals subsist on garbage retrieved from the Warsaw ghetto in daily truck runs. Jan’s plan is to smuggle Jews hidden under the refuse to the zoo, where they are secreted in the basement of the house occupied by the family, which includes their young son, Ryszard (played at different ages by Timothy Radford and Val Maloku).There are ample opportunities for the movie to stir up fear each time the truck leaves the ghetto, but the film has little appetite for cliffhanging suspense. The fugitives who emerge from under the garbage don’t look much the worse for wear. Although not without moments of terror and desperation, the screenplay’s leisurely timing subverts their dramatic impact.A subplot involves Antonina’s precarious balancing act as she charms the besotted Lutz, and resists surrendering to his increasingly aggressive moves as her jealous husband watches nervously from a distance. The screenplay is so frightened of this material that it isn’t always clear whether she has succumbed. But as Lutz evolves from a charmer into a bad, bad Nazi, the question of did she or didn’t she give in seems a feeble attempt to pump romantic excitement into a drama in dire need of moral complexity.Ms. Chastain’s watchful, layered performance helps keep the film on an even keel, but it is not enough to prevent “The Zookeeper’s Wife,” with its reassuringly cuddly critters, from feeling like a Disney version of the Holocaust.",0,17407536.0,,0

SCOTT,"It’s All Over, Earthlings (Don’t Flee to New Jersey)","Long after we are gone, science fiction movies about our impending extinction will instruct whoever comes next that we were a strange, neurotic species indeed. We could not — cannot — get enough of fantasies of destruction, meant at once to inflame and soothe our fear of vanishing altogether, whether through war, ecological catastrophe, disease or alien invasion.We know we have it coming, and a movie like “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” either in its 1951 version or in the “reimagining” that opens Friday, invites us to feel fleetingly bad about that even as we are encouraged to laugh it off. The laughter — at the earnest reckoning occasioned by a weary-looking extraterrestrial and his giant robot; at the panic and distress their visit provokes — serves as a necessary balm. Like other overwhelming emotions, the fear of apocalypse becomes more palatable when it is turned into camp.The old “Day,” made early in the atomic age, has long inspired this kind of laughter. It has also, in part because of its expressive, shadowy black-and-white cinematography, retained a measure of haunting, unsettling weirdness.Any hope that the new “Day,” directed by Scott Derrickson from a script by David Scarpa, might also someday rise above its pulpy, corny, somber silliness rests mainly on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves. Those shoulders are perfect for filling out a dark, narrow suit, just as Mr. Reeves’s deadpan basso and permanently perplexed features make him an ideal Klaatu, as the space visitor is called. Klaatu’s job is to assist, calmly and methodically, in the extermination of the human race, a task he tries, with evident fatigue, to explain to his hysterical, violent would-be victims.Only one will listen:  Dr. Helen Benson, played with a bit too much ennui by Jennifer Connelly. Helen, an expert in astrobiology, is part of a team of scientists taken into government custody by force when a giant orb seems about to crash into the Earth. Instead it lands in Central Park, disgorging that giant metal Cyclops robot (a near replica of the one from the earlier movie) and poor Klaatu.The secretary of defense (Kathy Bates, with Hillary Clinton’s demeanor and Sarah Palin’s hair) responds with military force, which only speeds the process of humanity’s annihilation and demonstrates that our executioners may have a point. We’re such a brutal, dumb, incorrigible life form that the only way the planet can survive is if we’re no longer on it. (In 1951 the case against us was mainly pacifist. Now the anti-militarism has a more urgent and explicit ecological dimension.) A metastasizing swarm of metal bugs — the best special effects in a movie that often looks cheap and bedraggled — is dispatched to eat us and everything we’ve made, or at least everything on the New Jersey Turnpike.But wait, Helen pleads. We can change! To provide evidence of this transformative potential she takes Klaatu to see her mentor,  Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese), a scientist who listens to Bach and was awarded a Nobel Prize for “altruistic biology.” Apparently this is the Swedish Academy’s euphemism for pimping: the good doctor’s advice to Helen about how to approach Klaatu is to “persuade him not with your reason, but with yourself.”Still, any movie that awards a former Monty Python cast member a Nobel Prize in anything cannot be all bad. And “The Day the Earth Stood Still” could be worse. Its scenario and many of its scenes feel ripped off rather than freshly imagined — why do aliens always seem to end up in New Jersey? — and the relationship between Helen and her stepson, Jacob (Jaden Smith), does not quite add the necessary element of heart-tugging sentiment.After “Wall-E” and “I  Am Legend” and the dozens of apocalypse flicks since the last “Day the Earth Stood Still” we can surely do better. Even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, much as he did back when we knew him as Neo.“The Day the Earth Stood Still” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

572,2012-10-26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:16,ANDY WEBSTER,A Mile a Minute in One Long Nightmare,"The distinction between actors and special effects shrinks ever further in the video game-turned-horror film “Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,” which reduces its human players to plastic action figures in tired genre settings.A sequel to “Silent Hill” from 2006, the movie follows Heather (Adelaide Clemens), now almost 18, who has had to change her name from Alessa in her wanderings with her father (Sean Bean). The back story — and the current one — are hazy, but apparently Heather’s mom (Radha Mitchell) was lost to Silent Hill, a town-dreamscape of shifting environments, and now Dad has been spirited away and Heather must rescue him.With her new high school friend Vincent (Kit Harington), she enters this nightmare realm, comprising wheezy horror hangouts like an asylum, an amusement park, an abattoir and a surgery room, all abounding with dank, dusty detritus. And she encounters malevolent entities (a pyramid-headed executioner, harpy-like nurses, a creature cobbled from mannequin limbs) that manifest a mild modicum of invention. She also briefly interacts with, yes, actors, many of whom (Deborah Kara Unger, Malcolm McDowell, Carrie-Anne Moss) deserve much, much better.The film is nothing if not liberal with its bloodletting, which integrates cleverly at times with the 3-D: lopped fingers, for example, fly toward the audience. But personalities and plot are thumbnail sketches at best. Silent Hill gamers have goals to reach for; “Silent Hill: Revelation 3D” viewers receive little to sustain them.“Silent Hill: Revelation 3D” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for brief nudity and violence.",0,,,0

By turns brutal and sentimental, lovely and lurid, as serious as the grave and blissfully preposterous, it combines a truckload of plot with many of the obsessions, tropes, sights and sounds that distinguish his other movies, from kinetic gun battles to cool beauties gazing into the distance in sunglasses. Here those beauties are a pair of improbable computer savants, played by Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei, who race, jet and furiously bang on keyboards across the globe while chasing villainy, lines of code and millions in loot.The jampacked story, pegged to a shadow hacker stirring up global trouble, could have been gleaned from the latest news. The inspiration for the script, by Morgan Davis Foehl, was an attack on the Natanz uranium enrichment plant in Iran by malware deployed through USB flash drives. The movie opens with an explosion at a nuclear power plant in Hong Kong, where Chinese officials call in Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom), who in turn taps his sister, Lien (Ms. Tang), for help and then an old school friend, Nick Hathaway (Mr. Hemsworth).Another, more benign hacker turned prisoner, Hathaway is first seen reading Jean Baudrillard’s “The System of Objects,” a neo-Marxist critique of the commodification of everyday life. Also adorning Hathaway’s shelves is “Discipline and Punish,” Michel Foucault’s inquiry into modern penal systems and disciplinary technologies of power, including surveillance. The nods to these heavyweights happen in an eye blink, and they felt gratuitous and self-conscious the first time I saw “Blackhat.” (Jean-François Lyotard’s “The Postmodern Condition” is also on the shelf, as is Jacques Derrida.)The movie’s suppositions — namely that the world is now a surveillance penitentiary — emerge clearly enough that you don’t need these intellectual signposts, even if name-dropping philosophers has long been par for the cinematic course for the likes of, say, Jean-Luc Godard. Yet such allusions are of a piece with Mr. Mann’s singular hybrid approach, which exists at the crossroads of the classical Hollywood cinema and the European art film and is evident in his oscillation between action and introspection, transformation and stasis, exterior and interior realms.A maximalist, Mr. Mann crams a great deal into the movie’s fleet two-hour running time, including the nuclear mishap, a commodities run-up, some cyber-slapstick with the National Security Agency and the specter of 9/11. Once Hathaway has been cut loose from federal lockup with an ankle monitor, he joins a stellar backup team tasked with catching the power-plant hacker that includes Viola Davis on lead. Her character, Carol Barrett, is an agent for the F.B.I. whose reddish wig, plumy lashes and cavalcade of weary sighs and devastating deadpan stares are among the movie’s best special effects. Barrett serves as Hathaway’s handler and coordinates the American team with the Chinese, while Ms. Davis’s fine-grained performance deepens the movie’s emotional texture.Mr. Hemsworth is a brooding Adonis best known for playing Thor in the big-screen cartoons who should be better known for playing a racecar driver in the undersung “Rush.” He has a pallor and hard-body physique that don’t jibe with the usual mental snapshot of the puny, pasty criminal hacker, even if his bulk makes sense as a jailhouse defense. He isn’t a persuasive typist (he was tutored on his keyboard fingerwork), but what he does have is a natural pensiveness bordering on melancholy that creates a nice frisson with his bulging muscles and heartthrob looks. You can see him diving into thought, which works for a role that requires his character to serve as our conduit for a lot of jargon. His strong physicality also works with the movie’s sense of hacking and other tech work as labor.Like the safecracker played by James Caan in “Thief,” Mr. Mann’s 1981 thriller, Hathaway is defined — as a man and professional, but also as a friend, lover and target — through his job. The characters in “Blackhat” spend a great deal of time staring at screens and making like Rachmaninoff with their keyboards, a familiar image for the increasing numbers of people who are plugged in for work, play or both, even as they’re increasingly disconnected from the physical world. This disconnect and its dangers are something of a refrain in the movie and are invoked in Hathaway’s prison-house philosophy (when not perusing Baudrillard, he connects mind and body by, um, doing ironman push-ups) and in the conceit of faceless terrorists who, hidden in a virtual world, wreak damage on human beings.All this face time with blinking screens is in the service of the story’s turns, many of which involve following the digital trail left by the hacker who infiltrated the nuclear plant. That initially makes “Blackhat” a cat-and-mouse game, one that shifts into high-action gear with the introduction of the hacker’s army of thugs, whose apparatus of choice is a machine gun and whose leader is a dead-eyed enforcer, Elias (an excellent Ritchie Coster). The chase takes Hathaway and company through computer networks, a pursuit that Mr. Mann at times represents by plunging deep into the physical networks, running straight into the guts of the machine, much as he did in “Thief” when he pushed his camera in for a peek inside a lock cylinder as it’s being picked.That’s pretty cool, as are the various Far Eastern locations that add palpable density to the movie’s thin-looking, at times near-translucent visuals. The contrast between the richness of the action and the thinness of the (still beautiful) images is just one of many dualities that run through the movie, as when Mr. Mann cuts from a fanlike image spreading across a screen to a huge flame shooting out from under a Hong Kong cook’s wok. Time and again, he puts computer and other spaces into play visually, mapping a brave new world with images of kaleidoscopically pulsing screens and the jewel-like glittering of nighttime megacities. The practical locations, with real bodies moving through real spaces, underline the idea that something big is still at stake in the physical world.A few times, though, notably during a chaotic fight in a crowded Jakarta square that turns multitudes into a streaming network, the locations feel like an directorial extravagance and a mistake. Those bodies are finally too decorative and disposable, and the ease with which they fall undercuts the movie’s moral seriousness. Mr. Mann fares better in more intimately scaled scenes, whether inside a restaurant with Hathaway and Lien or out on the street with some joltingly personal shootouts. Whether his characters are making love or war, Mr. Mann often captures them in tight close-ups that thrust their faces into the foreground of the shot. It’s a visual choice that briefly isolates these men and women from a world that, like everyone else, they’re desperate to comprehend.“Blackhat” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘Da Sweet Blood of Jesus,’ Spike Lee’s Vampire Movie","“Da Sweet Blood of Jesus,” Spike Lee’s new film, is a grisly and ghoulish vampire story. It is also an evident labor of love. The opening images — a solitary dancer undulating on the Red Hook waterfront, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and other Kings County spots — offer a reminder that no filmmaker has shot this borough as beautifully and fondly as Mr. Lee. Martha’s Vineyard, where much of the action takes place, looks pretty good too. And though there are episodes of bloody mayhem and steamy sex, the mood is contemplative, at times almost serene. Mr. Lee has earned a reputation as a polemicist and provocateur, but he has also been, from the beginning, a sensualist and a visual stylist.He is also a student of film history and African-American culture, interests that explicitly converge in “Da Sweet Blood,” which is an affectionate remake of Bill Gunn’s “Ganja and Hess.” That movie, first released in 1973 and currently part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s revelatory series on black independent cinema of the 1970s and ’80s, is a horror movie suffused with an experimental spirit, intellectual energy and a sly political sensibility. A product of the blaxploitation era, it is much more of a philosophical love story than an exercise in genre sensationalism.Mr. Lee, who financed this project partly through a Kickstarter campaign, updates the tale while staying true to its ideas and (mostly) to its plot. Early and late, “Da Sweet Blood” visits a Brooklyn church where the minister (Thomas Jefferson Byrd) seems especially interested in the vampiric subtext of certain New Testament verses. These implications spring to the surface when Hess Green (Stephen Tyrone Williams), an aristocratic scholar and art collector, has a mishap with an Ashanti ritual dagger.The weapon is wielded by Lafayette Hightower (Elvis Nolasco), an unstable, suicidal house guest. After being stabbed, Hess awakens with an addiction to blood. He tries at first to feed his new habit nonviolently — snatching plasma from a clinic — but soon settles into more traditional methods. The fact that he preys on prostitutes and other poor, single women allows Mr. Lee to revisit one of his perennial themes, the class divisions among African-Americans. Hess, with his mansion on the Vineyard and his chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, is a prince and a demon, a lonely, disconnected man even before he becomes a literal monster.But then he meets Ganja (Zaraah Abrahams), Hightower’s former wife, and, before long, Hess’s partner in thirst. Their romance doesn’t always go smoothly, but “Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” doesn’t delve too deeply into their emotions. Mr. Williams is a quiet, recessive screen presence, without the brooding charisma that Duane Jones brought to the character in “Ganja and Hess,” and while Ms. Abrahams is more theatrical, the passion between them rarely rises above room temperature. Felicia Pearson and Rami Malek, in smaller roles, provide a crackle of humor, and Jeni Perillo shows up near the end to add some extra sexual heat.This is, all in all, one of Mr. Lee’s cooler joints, meaning both that it is suavely stylish and feels detached from its own emotions and motivations. It’s not especially horrifying, or even very thought-provoking. It is touching, however, because it represents one frequently misunderstood, intermittently great filmmaker’s tribute to another.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,"Nine Years Later, Once More","Where did the time go? Has it really been nine years since we last saw Celine and Jesse, in Paris, rekindling the romance that first sparked nine years before that, in Vienna? Luckily (for us and for them) they are still together, having hatched a pair of sweet blond twin girls and glided, or maybe stumbled, into their 40s. And, of course, because they are played by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, Celine and Jesse are still better looking than most of the rest of us, and still have quite a lot to say about themselves, each other and the world.“Before Midnight,” the third of Richard Linklater’s Aristotelian bulletins from the field of Gen-X solipsism, finds them in Greece, at the end of a summer vacation that has been pleasant, though not entirely carefree. These two have never been terribly easygoing, despite their efforts to keep things casual and cool. For their Peloponnesian sojourn, they were joined by Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), Jesse’s son from the stateside marriage that conclusively ended when he missed the plane home from Paris in “Before Sunset.” The boy’s departure precipitates some soul-searching on his father’s part. Jesse wishes they could have more time together, and wants to explore the possibility of moving to Chicago from their home in Paris to be closer to Hank and challenge the custody arrangements that have kept him with his unnamed, conveniently demonized mother. Celine, perhaps jumping to conclusions and perhaps wise to Jesse’s passive-aggressive ways, interprets his invitation to think about the move as a demand to make it happen.They will fight about this, but not only or primarily about this, in the course of a day that includes a leisurely drive from the airport, a long meal with friends and a reluctant visit to a hotel in a charming seaside town. At one point an implicit allusion is made to “Voyage to Italy,” Roberto Rossellini’s great 1954 film about the foundering of a marriage in a picturesque Mediterranean location. In that movie, the bright sun exposes fissures in the relationship between the characters played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman, who also seemed haunted by the ghosts of vanished civilizations.Jesse and Celine, though they are creatures of a different time, are susceptible to a similar malaise. Their complaints about each other may be banal and specific — he’s a slob; she’s a nit-picker — but, as always, their quarrels and digressions gesture toward something larger.I don’t mean the way they talk about big ideas, though that is one of their habits. Jesse, a writer, spends some time spit-balling themes for his new novel in the company of an older colleague and a Greek neighbor, and a bunch of perennial philosophical puzzles — the meaning of love, the nature of time, the difference between men and women — are batted around over wine and stuffed peppers (in company that includes Athina Rachel Tsangari, the director of “Attenberg,” and Ariane Labed, that film’s star.) This talk is sometimes interesting, sometimes exasperating, and impressively true to the rhythms and idioms of actual speech. It constitutes nearly all of the action in the movie, though there is also some walking, driving and an inconclusive attempt at sex. But the words are only incidentally, or superficially, what the movie is about. They represent Jesse and Celine’s attempt — and Mr. Linklater’s — to control the flow of experience, to find meaning and to keep a terrible and nameless anxiety at bay.“Before Sunrise,” “Before Sunset” and “Before Midnight” are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists’ offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion. Mr. Linklater’s shooting style is so graceful and unobtrusive, and Mr. Hawke and Ms. Delpy inhabit their characters with such conviction, that the challenge and originality of the movies are easy to overlook. It is also easy to be distracted by your feelings about Jesse and Celine, who can get on your nerves almost as much as they get on each other’s.But that is part of the genius, and also the integrity, of this cycle of films. It is hard to think of a pair of lovers in recent screen history who expend less effort trying to charm the audience. All of their attention is focused on each other, with the rest of us as intimate witnesses, laughing and cringing and sometimes crying as they tack from coy evasion to vicious honesty and back. Celine’s anger — a general feminist impatience with men and a particular resentment of Jesse’s self-absorption — is both thrilling and shocking. Jesse’s dreamy intellectualism can be appealing, but you can also see how his complacency provokes Celine’s rage.If the spectacle this time is funnier and more poignant than before, that is because the stakes have shifted. “Before Sunrise” was a bittersweet romance about young people — Could we ever really have been that young? Are we really that old now? — with all the time in the world to savor regrets and learn from mistakes. “Before Sunset” was a comedy of second chances, zigzagging toward a long-deferred happy ending. “Before Midnight,” however, is something rarer and riskier. In her new book, “I Do and I Don’t,” the film scholar Jeanine Basinger tracks the history of “the marriage movie,” an elusive, perhaps mythical genre that tries to dramatize one of the most common and mysterious of human relations. In modern cinema, she writes, “stories of marriage grew less and less dramatic, slowing down to an almost cinéma-vérité movement toward realism, with no resolution or explanation to be found, and certainly no explanation of what kept any couple together.”Though Celine and Jesse are not married, “Before Midnight” fits this description almost exactly, which is to say that it is exquisitely attuned to the fragile, flawed nature of their bond. We have known them, and they have known each other, for a long time now, but we don’t know, from one moment to the next, what their future will be, or what it is that keeps them going.That kind of uncertainty, a scary fact of life, is something most movies avoid. We prefer the magical thinking of neat endings, tidy plots and clear character arcs. “Before Midnight” is a wonderful paradox: a movie passionately committed to the ideal of imperfection that is itself very close to perfect.“Before Midnight” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Mr. Combs, who topped Forbes’s 2017 list of highest-paid celebrities, is a mogul in television, clothing, fragrances and spirits. “Can’t Stop” sticks with the music, focusing on preparations for two Bad Boy reunion concerts in May 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.After glimpsing visitors and performers backstage — including Jay-Z, Faith Evans and Lil’ Kim — we learn of Mr. Combs’s beginnings at Uptown Records, before his ascent with a string of platinum Bad Boy albums. Much time is devoted to Biggie Smalls and his 1997 killing in a drive-by shooting amid the coastal rap rivalry that also claimed Tupac Shakur. (“Puff was Big’s big brother,” Jay-Z says, invoking one of Mr. Combs’s nicknames.) On camera, Clive Davis, Jimmy Iovine, Mary J. Blige and others testify to Mr. Combs’s gifts. (Mr. Combs, of course, produced the film, with Heather Parry.)After rehearsals in Lititz, Pa., the players hit Barclays, where an audio glitch dampens Mr. Combs’s entrance on a riser. On the film’s soundtrack, Nina Simone’s “I Feel Good” accompanies a glossy montage of stage footage, but the artists performing at the concert aren’t heard until the closing credits, and only briefly. What “Can’t Stop” mostly leaves you with is a sense of Mr. Combs’s success.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,"Lives of Real Adolescents, in Very Deep Close-Up","“American Teen” is populated by  high school archetypes, kids who might have stepped out of the mists of your own adolescence or, if you’ve managed to suppress those memories, out of other teen movies, from the canonical works of John Hughes to, um, “Not Another Teen Movie.”There is the blond popular girl, Megan Krizmanich, and her blond sidekick, Ali Wikalinska, young women who wield inordinate power over the social fates of their peers. There is Colin Clemens, the basketball star hoping to land a college scholarship and facing pressure at home from his ex-athlete dad. There is Hannah Bailey, the artsy misfit girl who dreams of becoming a filmmaker and who enters into a transgressive romance with a dimple-chinned athlete named Mitch Reinholt. And there is also  Jake Tusing, a self-identified nerd with a bad haircut, serious acne and a heavy  video-game habit.They are all helpfully labeled on the film’s Web site — Princess, Jock, Rebel, Heartthrob and Geek — and then shoehorned into a series of senior-year narratives, each one turning on a predictable but nonetheless gripping question. Will the popular girl get her comeuppance, or see the error of her ways? Will the geek get a date for the prom? Will it work out between the arty girl and her mismatched beau? Will the team win the big game?Not everything works out according to the teen movie formula. There are some odd developments and unexpected reversals — a trip to Tijuana, a breakup via text message — to complicate the anticipated narrative arc. There are moments of breathtaking cruelty, unguarded emotion and plain weirdness. And there are some genuinely scary turns, as when Hannah, brutally dumped by the boyfriend before Mitch, falls into a depression so severe that she can’t bring herself to go to school.But the real twist is that all  the characters in “American Teen” are real people, students in Warsaw, Ind., discovered by Nanette Burstein and arrayed in her fascinating,  queasy-making new documentary. The fascination comes from how unguarded these young people seem to be about their own lives, speaking frankly to the camera and allowing it to observe uncomfortable and intimate moments in their lives. The queasiness, inevitably, arises from the same source.It goes without saying that a documentary film that finds non-famous, non-adult people at an especially vulnerable crux in their lives is something of an ethical minefield. Can a filmmaker investigate the sexual, emotional and family lives of innocent youngsters without slipping into exploitation? The easy answer, confirmed by “American Teen,” is no way. And why even try? In a project like this one, the line between sympathy and prurience is not so much thin as nonexistent. Once we know a little about how these kids think, interact and behave, we are caught between the hunger to know everything and the impulse to look away before we learn too much.Not that Ms. Burstein shows us anything explicit, shocking or even especially surprising. “American Teen” includes some swearing, drinking and smoking, a lot of vicious gossip and a smattering of sex talk, but nothing likely to feed the cultural appetite for panic at the spectacle of kids gone wrong. What might make an older viewer feel a little squeamish is that the Warsaw High seniors seem almost completely undefended, without the sense of shame or privacy that might protect them from our prying eyes. Even when they are wearing microphones, few of them display much visible self-consciousness or discomfort. You might almost think they were acting out scenes rather than just living their lives.And in a way they are, and not only because some of the dramatic moments Ms. Burstein captures feel as if they might have been rehearsed. Adolescence has more than its share of built-in drama, and high school can resemble an endless series of auditions, performances and soap opera episodes. But the members of the class of 2006, to which the subjects of  in “American Teen” belong, are part of a generation whose media-saturated lives make Andy Warhol and Marshall McLuhan look positively naïve. Ms. Burstein’s presence, invisible and unremarked upon, is in a way almost redundant in the era of Facebook, YouTube and reality television. These kids were toddlers when MTV first aired “The Real World,” and being on camera, or online, is another way of being themselves.The contrivances of “American Teen” — the animated sequences, the arrangement of chaotic events into coherent story lines, the withholding of information to increase the impact of its disclosure — become tokens of authenticity. This is the kind of movie the people in it might have made, which means that its revelatory power as an investigation of teenage life in America is limited. It tweaks but does not entirely satisfy your desire to see the alleged typicality of the Warsaw High seniors deepened into a source of social insight. Matters of class come up only obliquely, and parents are largely in the shadows, and when they emerge they are reliably clueless, bumbling and unsympathetic. They have the double disadvantage of being grown-ups in a teen movie and of being, compared with  their children, less intuitively aware of what it means to parade before the camera, on screen, living an ordinary American life.“American Teen” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It depicts or refers to teenage drinking, smoking, sex and swearing.AMERICAN TEENOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Nanette Burstein; directors of photography, Laela Kilbourn, Wolfgang Held and Robert Hanna; edited by Mary Manhardt, Tom Haneke and Ms. Burstein; music by Michael Penn; produced by Ms. Burstein, Jordan Roberts, Eli Gonda and Chris Huddleston; released by Paramount Vantage.

What it doesn’t lack is compassion, either for the wounds of childhood or the trap of ethnicity.Filming in their home state, Montana, the brothers Alex Smith and Andrew Smith (adapting a 1974 novel by the Native American writer James Welch) sweat to translate Virgil’s existential pain into a visual narrative. Scenes dissolve and bleed into one another as he staggers between a small, arid town and the farmhouse he shares with his tart-tongued mother and his silent grandmother. Rarely without a flask or bottle at his lips (we first meet him passed out in a ditch), Virgil has a bloated, tipsy gait and a lost-boy look. He also has a runaway wife and a black hole where his identity should be.Similar to the brothers’ previous feature, “The Slaughter Rule” (2002), “Winter” buckles beneath male conflict and heavy-handed metaphors. But the cinematographer, Paula Huidobro, captures the Montana plains and infinite skyline in wide, lyrical sweeps, while gauzy cross-fades parallel the ebb and flow of Virgil’s memories and hallucinations. Real and surreal weave together, and an impeccably chosen soundtrack — by, among others, the Heartless Bastards and Robert Plant — reinforces a mood that veers from dreamy to violent with shocking suddenness.The journey from page to screen may have battered Mr. Welch’s novel, but its lamenting heart beats loud and clear.",0,,,1

This tear-stained lump of hokum, drenched in oversaturated color, is a World War II fable about faith versus magical thinking.The unseen narrator is Pepper, looking back at his anguished California childhood, when his beloved father, James (Michael Rapaport), a car mechanic, left home to fight the Japanese and was reported missing in action. Once Daddy is gone, 8-year-old Pepper (Jakob Salvati) is taunted by his peers who call him “little boy” because he is short.Pepper finds hope at a children’s magic show when his participation in an onstage stunt leaves him believing he possesses telekinetic powers. He is fortified by memories of his father’s giving him courage when facing physical challenges with the words “Do you believe you can do this?”The story compares Pepper’s persecution to the harassment of Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a gentle Japanese-American who is considered a pariah on the home front.Pepper, encouraged to make amends after he and his teenage brother, London (David Henrie), throw stones at Hashimoto’s house, develops a student-teacher bond with Hashimoto that is reminiscent of “The Karate Kid.” With Hashimoto’s help, Pepper sets about carrying out the Roman Catholic Church’s Seven Corporal Works of Mercy.In the most preposterous scene, Pepper’s desperate arm-waving attempt to prove that faith can move mountains coincides with an earthquake, earning him the awe of the bigoted, credulous townspeople, who cheer when news arrives of the bombing of Hiroshima. The queasiest moment of this crass, manipulative claptrap is the mention that the bomb was named Little Boy.“Little Boy” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Allow me to introduce the hero of “Playing It Cool,” a struggling writer named Me (Chris Evans, insufferable) whose incessant narration — for audiences, if not for his luckless love interest — is inescapable.Proceeding with a strained quirkiness that infects much more than the names of its main characters, this first feature by Justin Reardon is a paean to the kind of narcissism that sucks the air out of every scene. Me, a writer whose rom-com screenplay is hindered by his never having been in love, suffers from abandonment issues and the conviction that it’s fine to stalk the lovely Her (Michelle Monaghan), a young woman with a boyfriend and a natural warmth that jarringly illuminates her pursuer’s slick superficiality.A series of monotonous “friend dates” follows, as does a flash mob of clichés, some of which recall exponentially better movies like “Say Anything” (1989) and “The Graduate” (1967). Insipid fantasy vignettes allow the cast to dress up in old-timey costumes, and a clutch of generically oddball sidekicks — almost all of whom (especially the wonderfully subtle Topher Grace) would have made more convincing romantic leads — facilitates the delivery of off-color jokes.Cut loose from the flash-bang-wallop of the “Captain America” and “Avengers” franchises, Mr. Evans seems lost. But it’s Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair’s hackneyed writing that really does him in.“It’s a rare thing when a script comes across your desk that truly knocks the wind out of you,” McG, one of the film’s many producers, confides in the publicity notes.

Directed by Andrew Lau, best known in the United States for the terrific “Infernal Affairs” trilogy, the new movie takes place during the Qing dynasty, China’s last imperial era. Guns are the latest looming threat, though their danger is largely dwarfed by the man on the throne, Emperor Yongzheng (Wai-keung Lau), who ruled from 1722 to 1735. The movie’s title refers to a secret squad of elite assassins — truly, is there any other kind? — named after their weapon of choice: a doughnut-shaped blade that looks like a specialty circular saw and closes around the neck of a victim like a lethal collar. The assassins use curved swords to lob these portable guillotines, lacrosse-style, mowing down the opposition with terminal efficiency. Although Mr. Lau and the special-effects team linger over the spinning blades with near fetishistic longing, there’s also a suitably disturbing undertow to these spinning apparatuses. Much like their French namesake, the guillotines introduce a mechanical aspect to killing, opening up a physical and moral distance between executioners and executed that ensuing technologies of death will widen. This theme surfaces when the squad, while trying to capture a popular rebel leader, a Jesus or maybe Mao-like figure called Wolf (Huang Xiaoming), faces an unexpected threat: a new emperor-sanctioned patrol armed with guns. The emperor, determined to secure his place in history and casting an eye at the cannons of the encroaching West, has decided that blade-chucking killers may not be the most flattering examples of his legacy. To that end, he sends out a trusted aide, Du (Shawn Yue), to accompany their mutual childhood friend and the leader of the Guillotines, Leng (Ethan Juan), on the pack’s Wolf hunt. What none of the Guillotines know, at least initially, is that after Wolf has been bagged, the Guillotines will be next on the chopping block. The energetic Mr. Lau does what he can with the messy story, but despite some glorious locations, a cast of seemingly (real human rather than digital) thousands and a provocative historical frame, the incrementally served up pieces never satisfactorily cohere. The blades fly as do the heads, but the movie remains disappointingly aground.“The Guillotines” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

But “The Layover,” which probably scrapes by thanks to a line here or there, plays as if it were designed to thumb its nose at the concept.Directed by William H. Macy, for some reason, and written by David Hornsby and Lance Krall, the movie concerns two longtime Seattle friends who, when not in the presence of men, watch “The Bachelor.” Kate (Alexandra Daddario) is a teacher; Meg (Kate Upton) aspires to sell luxury cosmetics, though no one is buying her North Korean imports.To cure workplace blues, the pair hop a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and wind up seated next to Ryan (Matt Barr), their mutual masculine ideal. His half-interested presence compels them into destructive, flirty one-upmanship, especially after a hurricane diverts their plane to St. Louis (not the best-timed plot point) and they run into Ryan at their hotel.It’s a Sheraton, incidentally; if the chain didn’t pay for product placement, its logo and amenities got quite a bit of free play. Given the dimwitted clientele, however, the advertisement may not be such a steal.

Tu Angu (Wang Xue-qi). Over the next 15 years Chen will raise the boy as his own, naming him Bo and wangling both of them into the palace of the usurper, who unwittingly agrees to become Bo’s godfather. Torn between two dads — one rich and magnanimous, the other servile and smotheringly strict — poor Bo is as ignorant of his heritage as of Chen’s plan to use him as his avenger.Given that the important female characters are swiftly dispatched early on, this is a film heavy with the desires of men who appear to have no interest in, or access to, sex. (A concubine or two would have brightened things up considerably.) And though the initial coup is staged with wit as well as blood — did you know you could overthrow a ruler with a mosquito, a mad dog and a strategically placed tripwire? — Mr. Chen’s direction feels more ponderous than usual. Perhaps it’s all that armor, or that even the estimable Mr. Wang seems exhausted by the film’s dolorous themes, but it’s tough to care about characters who spend most of their lives obsessing over the violent deaths of others.“Sacrifice” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"For a Cold War, a Blue Superhero (and Friends)","The only character in “Watchmen” who possesses actual superpowers — resulting from an accident at a top-secret government research lab in the late 1950s — is Dr. Manhattan, a blue, bald, naked dude with blank eyes and the voice of Billy Crudup. Dr. Manhattan’s existence is busy and fairly melancholy, but I do envy him his ability to perceive every moment of past and future time as a part of a continuous present.If I had that power, the 2 hours 40 minutes of Zack Snyder’s grim and grisly excursion into comic-book mythology might not have felt quite so interminable. (“It will never end,” says Dr. Manhattan. “Nothing ever ends.” No indeed.) Also, an enhanced temporal perspective would make it possible to watch “Watchmen” not in 2009 but back in 1985, when the story takes place, and when the movie might have made at least a little more sense.The original graphic novel, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, was published by DC in 1986 and ’87, first serially and then in a single volume, and it quickly gained a following in discriminating geek circles. The book was very much a product of its moment, both in the history of comics — which were scouting new horizons of complexity and thematic ambition — and in the wider world that “Watchmen” mirrored.Mr. Moore and Mr. Gibbons confected a dour alternative chronology of cold-war America, defined by victory in Vietnam, an endless Nixon presidency, nuclear brinkmanship and pervasive social rot. At the same time, they offered a self-conscious critique of the national preoccupation with muscled, masked crime-fighters. Their heroes — the paranoid Rorschach, the shy Nite Owl II, the coldly post-human Dr. Manhattan and various other colleagues and rivals — were violent, ambivalent, treacherous and vain, even though they also seemed to be uniquely capable of saving the world from ultimate catastrophe.Somewhat remarkably, Mr. Snyder’s film freezes its frame of reference in the 1980s, preserving the dank, downcast, revanchist spirit of the original and adding a few period-specific grace notes of its own, including time-capsule references to Lee Iacocca and “The McLaughlin Group.” There is also a nod of homage in the direction of “Apocalypse Now” and a soundtrack heavy with the baby-boomer anthems that still echoed in the ears of Reagan-era adolescents.Indeed, the ideal viewer — or reviewer, as the case may be — of the “Watchmen” movie would probably be a mid-’80s college sophomore with a smattering of Nietzsche, an extensive record collection and a comic-book nerd for a roommate. The film’s carefully preserved themes of apocalypse and decay might have proved powerfully unsettling to that anxious undergraduate sitting in his dorm room, listening to “99 Luftballons” and waiting for the world to end or the Berlin Wall to come down.He would also no doubt have been stirred by the costumes of the female superheroes — Carla Gugino and Malin Akerman, both gamely giving solid performances — who sensibly accessorize their shoulder-padded spandex leotards with garter belts and high-heeled boots. And the dense involution of the narrative might have seemed exhilarating rather than exhausting.I’m not sure that this hypothetical young man — not to be confused with the middle-aged, 21st-century moviegoer he most likely grew into, whose old copy of “Watchmen” lies in a box somewhere alongside a dog-eared Penguin Classics edition of “Thus Spake Zarathustra” — would necessarily say that Mr. Snyder’s “Watchmen” is a good movie. I wouldn’t, though it is certainly better than the same director’s “300.” But it’s possible to imagine that our imaginary student would at least have found some food for thought in Mr. Snyder’s grandiose, meticulously art-directed vision of blood, cruelty and metaphysical dread. As it is, the film is more curiosity than provocation, an artifact of a faded world brought to zombie half-life by the cinematic technology of the present.The title sequence — in which Mr. Moore’s name, at his insistence, does not appear, leaving Mr. Gibbons listed, somewhat absurdly, as a solitary “co-creator” of the graphic novel — seems to acknowledge the project’s anachronistic, nostalgic orientation. As Bob Dylan sings “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” familiar images from the past are altered in ways both subtle and outrageous. Tableaus evoking Andy Warhol, the Zapruder film, Studio 54 and Weegee-style crime scenes commingle with snapshots from the lives of several generations of costumed crusaders. There is a witty pop sensibility evident in these pictures that gets the movie off to a promising start, even though such breeziness works to undermine the ambient gloom of the source material.That mood returns in full force, though, as Mr. Snyder and the screenwriters, David Hayter and Alex Tse, demonstrate remarkable, at times almost demented, fidelity to the original. Mr. Moore — whose work has been poorly served by movies like “V for Vendetta,” “From Hell” and “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” — has declared that “Watchmen” is impossible to film. Perhaps he meant to say redundant, since there are times that the filmmakers seem to have used his book less as an inspiration than as a storyboard. The inevitable omission of some stuff — a pirate-themed comic-within-the-comic; a mysterious gathering of artists and writers; a giant squid — may rankle die-hard cultists, but the tone of world-weary, self-justifying rage has been faithfully preserved, which may be a problem for everyone else.“Watchmen” begins with the gory, glass-shattering murder of the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a thuggish soldier of fortune who once helped Dr. Manhattan subdue the Vietcong. This killing sets in motion a series of flashbacks, digressions and long, expository conversations that take us from the grunge of New York City to Antarctica by way of Mars and that reveal a web of complicated relationships among more than a half-dozen major characters.It turns out that the Comedian, also known as Edward Blake, once tried to rape Silk Spectre (Ms. Gugino), whose daughter, Laurie (Ms. Akerman), a second-generation superhero, lives with Dr. Manhattan and drifts toward an affair with Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson). Or rather, with Dan Dreiberg, Nite Owl’s nebbishy alter ego, since an act of Congress has outlawed costumed vigilantism. The suave, calculating Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) has managed to find wealth and power in retirement. But no law can deter Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), whose notebook entries serve as voice-over narration and whose clammy, misanthropic worldview dominates the story.Speaking of acts of congress, “Watchmen” features this year’s hands-down winner of the bad movie sex award, superhero division: a moment of bliss that takes place on board Nite Owl’s nifty little airship, accompanied by Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.” (By the way, can we please have a moratorium on the use of this song in movies? Yes, I too have heard there was a secret chord that David played, and blah blah blah, but I don’t want to hear it again. Do you?)The sex may be laughable, but the violence is another matter. The infliction of pain is rendered in intimate and precise aural and visual detail, from the noise of cracking bones and the gushers of blood and saliva to the splattery deconstruction of entire bodies. But brutality is not merely part of Mr. Snyder’s repertory of effects; it is more like a cause, a principle, an ideology. And his commitment to violence brings into relief the shallow nihilism that has always lurked beneath the intellectual pretensions of “Watchmen.” The only action that makes sense in this world — the only sure basis for ethics or politics, the only expression of love or loyalty or conviction — is killing. And the dramatic conflict revealed, at long last, in the film’s climactic arguments is between a wholesale, idealistic approach to mass death and one that is more cynical and individualistic.This idea is sickening but also, finally, unpersuasive, because it is rooted in a view of human behavior that is fundamentally immature, self-pitying and sentimental. Perhaps there is some pleasure to be found in regressing into this belligerent, adolescent state of mind. But maybe it’s better to grow up.“Watchmen” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extreme violence, a naked blue man and some superhero sex.WATCHMENOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Zack Snyder; written by David Hayter and Alex Tse, based on the graphic novel illustrated by Dave Gibbons; director of photography, Larry Fong; edited by William Hoy; music by Tyler Bates; production designer, Alex McDowell; visual effects supervisor, John DesJardin; produced by Lawrence Gordon, Lloyd Levin and Deborah Snyder; released by Warner Brothers Pictures and Paramount Pictures.

This kind of thing happens so frequently — exceptions like “Where the Wild Things Are” and, arguably, “Shrek” prove the rule upheld by every recent big-screen Dr. Seuss adaptation — that you could almost believe that there is malice involved. Movie studios do a pretty good job of making pleasing, sometimes transporting family entertainment out of original ideas or ancient folklore. Why do they keep messing up the kiddie lit? Are they doing it on purpose?Probably not. “Alexander,” directed by Miguel Arteta, written by Rob Lieber and based on Judith Viorst’s beloved 1972 picture book, is less an act of spite than a failure of nerve. It approaches its young audience with an anxious, condescending smile that masks an unmistakable panic. What if they don’t like it? What if they’re bored? Or scared? Or upset? What if their parents take offense? To guard against such unwelcome responses, the movie tosses out a hectic barrage of almost-naughty jokes and gags (vomit is shown; poop is mentioned), reassuring speeches and constant signals that no matter what goes wrong, everything will be all right in the end. On the eve of his 12th birthday, Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) finds himself the odd man out in his relentlessly upbeat family. Mom (Jennifer Garner), who works at a publishing company, is in line for a big promotion if her latest title — an inspirational toilet-training manual for toddlers and their parents — takes off. Dad (Steve Carell), a laid-off aeronautical engineer turned cheerful stay-at-home father, has a job interview with a video game company. Alexander’s big sister (Kerris Dorsey) has the lead in the middle school production of “Peter Pan,” while his big brother (Dylan Minnette) has a prom date with “the hottest girl in school” (Bella Thorne). The baby is content until Alexander accidentally destroys his favorite pacifier.In frustration, Alexander wishes a bad day on all of them and then is appalled when it seems that his curse comes to life. Everything goes wrong, but somehow not quite wrong enough. The mishaps never rise to the level of true farce, in spite of Mr. Carell’s gifts as a physical comedian and Ms. Garner’s knack for acting stressed out.But in turning Ms. Viorst’s book (which has previously been adapted as a musical for the stage and an animated HBO short film) into a family caper, the filmmakers have robbed it of its empathy and insight. The original both has fun with and makes fun of Alexander’s frustration with the unfairness of the world and his own impotence. It is not afraid to show the conflicts that can roil even the most loving family.The movie is terrified of just that and goes so far in its insistence on harmony that it starts to feel actively dishonest, repressing the very energies it is pretending to unleash. Rather than recognizing themselves, their parents and their siblings on the screen, children in the audience are likely to wonder just who these smiling, anxious people are supposed to be. And then to forget the whole thing.“Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Mildly provocative humor and very bad driving.",0,56752482.0,,0

Yet if “Urban Hymn” starts with that familiar dynamic, it stays surprisingly fresh thanks to three fine performances and a willingness to be uncompromising.Kate (Shirley Henderson) is starting a job as a social worker at Alpha House, a home for wayward children where violence rules and the staff makes little effort to rehabilitate the residents. Kate, however, is fueled by a personal tragedy in her past and wants to make a real difference, especially in the life of Jamie (Letitia Wright), a 17-year-old who has been hardened and embittered by a difficult upbringing. Only when Kate discovers that Jamie can sing does she find a way to connect with her and offer some exciting possibilities.Yes, that plotline fuels the old myth of vocal or athletic ability as a magical way out of a disadvantaged life, but the movie, written by Nick Moorcroft and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, isn’t content to be a feel-good story. Not every troubled young person has musical talent or can shed her surliness the first time a grown-up pays attention to her. One of those who doesn’t and can’t is Leanne (Isabella Laughland), Jamie’s longtime friend, a street tough who is as eager to keep Jamie in juvenile delinquency as Kate is to save her.The fight scenes are nasty, the language is harsh and the three leads are utterly convincing.",1,,,0

Not the writer, Joseph Gangemi, whose strung-out adaptation of an Edgar Allan Poe short story is padded to the point of suffocation. And not the big-ticket actors — perhaps drawn by the charge of one another’s star power — who realize too late that they have stumbled into a lavishly costumed disaster.Much the way Edward (Jim Sturgess), a newly graduated doctor, stumbles down the rabbit hole when he seeks a position at the titular madhouse. A hulking monstrosity shrouded in mist and parked in the middle of nowhere (with Bulgaria subbing unconvincingly for England), the asylum is presided over by a progressive superintendent (Ben Kingsley at his most exaggeratedly dignified) and his sneering sidekick (David Thewlis). More interesting to Edward, however, is the luscious Eliza (Kate Beckinsale, emoting as if an Oscar nomination depended on it), a trembling hysteric whose shapely “trigger points” have already been drawn to his attention.Filled with capering extras and medieval devices, this shockingly flabby effort from Mr. Anderson — who, in features like “The Machinist” (2004) and “Session 9” (2001), showed a much surer hand with oppressive atmospheres and troubled psyches — feels as nutty as its characters. Even Michael Caine, no stranger to nuttiness, seems confused, playing a hirsute man whose imprisonment in a dank cage is a mystery I will leave unexplained. You’re welcome.“Stonehearst Asylum” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Psychoses in full swing, and Sir Michael Caine in a ball gag.",0,,,0
589,2012-08-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:15,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"For This Man-Child, the Thrill of the Chase Has Yet to Grow Old","Dax Shepard, the writer, co-director and star of the silly, occasionally amusing car chase comedy “Hit & Run,” isn’t the first actor to be defined by a signature television role. Like James Gandolfini’s Tony Soprano, Crosby Braverman, the California man-child Mr. Shepard plays on “Parenthood,” (53 episodes and counting), is so indelible that, like it or not, everything else Mr. Shepard does registers as a pallid reflection.His character in “Hit & Run,” Yul Perkins, is a sweet-natured, shady goofball in the witness protection program who goes by the pseudonym Charlie Bronson. (Don’t ask.) Charlie has the same ingenuous puppy-dog stare of a naughty boy playing dumb, and the same vacant, toothy grin and Owen Wilson drawl as Crosby, but none of the depth.When his live-in girlfriend, Annie (Kristen Bell, Mr. Shepard’s real fiancée), is handed an opportunity for a better job in Los Angeles, Charlie decides to throw caution to the wind and drive her there. He has been going stir crazy in Milton, the sleepy central California retreat where he is watched over by Randy (Tom Arnold), a buffoonish United States marshal whose solution to automotive mishaps is to shoot his own van.Annie believes Charlie’s assertion that he has been stashed in the middle of nowhere as protection after his testimony put bank robbers in jail. What he hasn’t told her is that he drove their getaway car and turned state’s evidence to avoid prison. When Annie’s jealous ex-boyfriend, Gil (Michael Rosenbaum), discovers Charlie’s true identity on the Internet, he tips off the lead robber, Alex (Bradley Cooper), who has been released from prison, and the games begin.Mr. Shepard, a car enthusiast, has cited the 1977 movie “Smokey and the Bandit” as an inspiration for “Hit & Run.” As the characters chase one another around in circles — Charlie’s pride and joy is a souped-up 1967 Lincoln Continental — the movie feels like a grown-up version of little boys making whooshing noises and staging collisions while playing with toys on a living room floor. It belongs to the same star-and-his-pals-cutting-up genre as the lesser comedies by Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack.Desperate for novelty, the story throws in a subplot in which a gay sheriff hooks up with Randy through a Grindr-like smartphone app called Pouncer. But the movie is too squeamish and dumb to treat this strand as more than a passing notion. It is just another prank in a comedy that feels as if it were dreamed up in the wee hours between bong hits and shots of tequila.“Hit & Run” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations, violence and strong language.",0,,,1

Everyone except Eddie, it seems, is getting some love, from the customers in the bagel shop where he works to his cheerfully randy roommate (a bang-on Glen Powell). So when he’s hired to supervise middle school detention, it seems particularly cruel that the one subject his students most need to learn is the one he may be least qualified to teach.Playing straight guy to a sturdy supporting cast — especially Retta (“Parks and Recreation”) as a wise confidante and Matt Walsh (“Veep”) as a washed-up supervisor — Mr. Osment, with his baby face and cushiony body, retains a childlike air that softens the raunch. Navigating Bill Kennedy’s uninspired and only mildly amusing script (structured around an energetic endorsement for sex education in schools), he doesn’t so much drive the action as bounce from one humiliation to another. Filthy conversations abound, mostly with a handful of trash-talking students and a series of female characters apparently conjured from a frat-boy wish list.Unevenly directed by Isaac Feder, “Sex Ed” droops. If you come for Retta’s “I got this” swagger, then stay for the improvised conversation between Mr. Walsh and Mr. Osment during the closing credits. It’s the freshest and funniest part of the movie.",0,,,0

In ‘Monster Trucks,’ Try a Cephalopod","Sometimes movies with the most unprepossessing titles can surprise you. Case in point: “Monster Trucks,” a spry, spirited and delightful family film that has nothing to do with giant-wheeled vehicles piling on top of one another in indoor arenas. Instead, it’s an eco-fable devoid of didactic overkill, delivered with energy, winking mischief, unobtrusive effects and a skilled cast.An oil company, personified by its chief executive (a rapacious Rob Lowe), is drilling in North Dakota when it hits a water-table mother lode of biological activity. A geyser releases an entity that finds its way to the small-town high-school senior Tripp (Lucas Till, the new MacGyver), whose buff physique and cleft chin belie his outsider status. Tripp, living with his working-class mother (Amy Ryan) and resenting her sheriff boyfriend (Barry Pepper), is a gear head seeking “something with four wheels that will get me out of this place.”Working at a junkyard, Tripp bonds with the creature, which he names Creech after an initial encounter redolent of the “E. T.” playbook. Creech, a huge cephalopod, subsists on oil, and takes up residence in Tripp’s decrepit jalopy, sometimes impertinently seizing control. (It’s an inspired C.G.I. creation, alternately threatening and childish, with expressive eyes, formidable teeth and an irrepressible chortle.)Back at the drilling site, Creech’s relatives are captured, and the oil company dispatches a heavy (Holt McCallany) to apprehend Creech. It falls to Tripp, a sympathetic geologist (Thomas Lennon) and Tripp’s friend Meredith (the winning Jane Levy, from “Don’t Breathe” and the underrated film “Fun Size”) to reunite Creech with his kin. Antic effects-laden car chases in town and country ensue, leading to a tender climax.

The title character, Charlie Mills (Nick Robinson), is its spoiled golden boy, a surly drug-addicted brat we first meet on his 18th birthday as he abandons the latest in a series of rehab institutions.This sour apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree. Charlie’s father, David (Cary Elwes), is a stunningly fatuous candidate for California governor who made his fortune as the star of a blockbuster Hollywood franchise about pirates. With his slicked blond hair and cold, arrogant sneer, this politician-come-lately is an empty suit robotically shaking hands while spewing inane platitudes at meet-and-greets. He has a fractious relationship with his tense, neurotic wife, Liseanne (Susan Misner).“Being Charlie” has a strong autobiographical component. According to the production notes, Nick Reiner (the director’s son) wrote the screenplay with Matt Elisofon, whom he met in rehab. Charlie, like Mr. Elisofon, is an aspiring stand-up comedian. And the brief scenes of Charlie on the stage reveal him to be a brash show-off with at least a modicum of talent.Let’s assume that Rob Reiner made a movie peopled with disagreeable characters to transcend the feel-good clichés of the nostalgic family entertainments for which he’s known with a more realistic film about contemporary issues. But the movie’s refusal to abandon commercial formulas and examine its characters’ inner lives suggests that the director’s years inside the Hollywood bubble may have prevented him from recognizing the degree to which independent films and television are already overrun with deeper, more sensitive explorations of addiction and recovery.When Charlie inevitably relapses and trolls Los Angeles’s meaner streets for a fix, you feel little sympathy for a character so shallow he seems incapable of introspection. Father-son confrontations and tough-love warnings from a rehab counselor (played by Common) are little more than boilerplate harangues.The movie’s first of many mistakes is to throw in a girlfriend from rehab, Eva (Morgan Saylor), with whom Charlie flouts rules that discourage romantic relationships among patients. Although Ms. Saylor brings some personality to her turbulent, unfocused character, you have the queasy sense that somebody decided the movie needed a pretty woman to give it some juice.But soon enough, “Being Charlie” forgets about Eva to concentrate on Charlie’s gruesome relapse on the eve of the governor’s election, and David’s having to cope with the negative publicity about his son’s behavior. It takes a drug-related tragedy to bring Charlie to his senses. The perfunctory upbeat ending leaves you unconvinced that worst is over.“Being Charlie” is not rated.

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘The 33’ Recalls a Chilean Mine Disaster and the Men Who Endured It,"The ordeal of the 33 Chilean miners trapped deep inside the earth after the collapse of a mine shaft in August 2010 was both an intensely local story and a global phenomenon. As family members waited in a makeshift camp near the mine’s opening, viewers across the world followed the progress of the rescue efforts thanks to round-the-clock news media attention. We breathed sighs of relief and wept tears of joy when the men finally emerged, after more than two months in subterranean heat and darkness. And then, as is our habit, we moved on.“The 33,” a new movie directed by Patricia Riggen from a screenplay by Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten and Michael Thomas, revisits the episode, effectively stirring up those emotions all over again and adding some new ones inspired by the lives of the miners and the challenge of bringing them out alive. In some ways, it’s foolproof material — moving and suspenseful even if you know the outcome. But Ms. Riggen, a Mexican-born filmmaker whose earlier features include “La Misma Luna” and “Girl in Progress,” has grappled with some formidable challenges, including the familiarity of the story. She also faced something of a numbers problem: 33 potential protagonists — as well as wives, sisters, children, government officials and engineers — is an awful lot to keep track of. To make matters trickier, most of those characters spend an awful lot of time confined in a small, stubbornly uncinematic space, not doing anything very dramatic.But with the help of some solid performances and James Horner’s heart-squeezing, throat-constricting score (one of the last he composed before his death in June), “The 33” holds your attention and pushes the required buttons. It starts above ground, at an outdoor party where miners eat, drink, dance, impersonate Elvis Presley and engage in some necessary preliminary exposition. By the time they pile into the bus for work the next morning, we are acquainted with the most important figures. Once the earth shifts and a giant rock seals them into a refuge hundreds of feet down, we know the function each one will play.The nominal leader is Don Lucho (Lou Diamond Phillips), the captain of the shift, but the actual leader is Mario (Antonio Banderas), a charismatic and persuasive guy who rations food, rallies morale and refuses to give up hope when things look grim. The other miners supply comic relief and dramatic interest. Darío (Juan Pablo Raba) is an alcoholic, comforted in his worst moments by José (Marco Treviño), a devout Christian. One man is about to become a father for the first time. Another is a few weeks from retirement. The Elvis impersonator (Jacob Vargas) teases the only Bolivian (Tenoch Huerta) in the group. Everyone teases Yonni (Oscar Nuñez) because of his complicated love life.His wife (Adriana Barraza) and mistress (Elizabeth De Razzo) quarrel about who has the right to wait for him with the other kinfolk, who include Darío’s sister (Juliette Binoche) and Mario’s wife (Kate del Castillo). Their presence puts pressure on the Chilean government, represented by a handsome young minister of mining (Rodrigo Santoro) and the portly, silver-haired president (Bob Gunton). The government minister and an engineer (Gabriel Byrne) argue about practicalities, and about how long to keep drilling to find the missing men.The dialogue is direct to the point of hokiness. Nearly every scene lands squarely on a clear note of feeling. When people laugh, they laugh much longer and louder than the situation seems to warrant. It’s that kind of movie. If you want richer context and deeper nuance, it can be found in “Deep Down Dark,” the book by the journalist Hector Tobar that is this film’s credited source.A true story in print is a work of journalism. A true story in a nondocumentary film is something else: a fable, a moralized version of reality. “The 33” sends out feelers in a lot of different directions. The circus outside the mine — the souvenir stands and cameras, the grandstanding politicians and opportunistic show business types — hints at a satire of modern media excess, a variation on the themes of Billy Wilder’s “Ace in the Hole.” The plot sometimes wobbles between the personal and procedural sides of the miners’ plight, but both the science and the sentiment feel a little thin.The film gains some clarity at the end, and delivers a strong and timely moral. “God was with us” the miners write on the wall of their refuge as they prepare to return to the sunlight, and at several points the movie emphasizes the importance of religion in their lives. This seems like a faith-inflected movie for the age of a Latin American populist pope, a parable of spiritual endurance with an eye on social and economic iniquities. Before the credits roll, we learn that the miners were never compensated for their suffering, and that the mining company was cleared of any negligence, a judgment the film emphatically challenges. We also learn that the 33, whose real-life faces fill the screen at the very end, “remain brothers to this day.”The moral is plain. Capital and the state don’t really care about you, though they can sometimes be shamed into acting in your interest. Better to put your trust in the Almighty, and in the solidarity of your fellow workers.“The 33” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Grave danger and mild profanity.

Various factions rose up to oppose his administration’s actions, including Aidesep, the interethnic association for the development of the Peruvian rain forest, an organization of indigenous Amazonians led by Alberto Pizango.“When Two Worlds Collide,” a documentary directed by the first-time feature filmmakers Heidi Brandenburg and Matthew Orzel, chronicles a conflict that resulted in one particularly effective piece of civil disobedience — a move by indigenous protesters to cut off commercial trucking routes — before it deteriorated into violence and death.The movie uses television news footage, and meetings and protests shot by the filmmakers, who have been recording their subjects since 2007, and recent interviews with former government figures and protesters. They also profile Mr. Pizango, who at one point seeks asylum in Nicaragua after being charged with sedition for leading protests, but returns to Peru to face those allegations a year later.The issues presented in “When Two Worlds Collide” are so crucial that it feels churlish to characterize it as a dutiful, and ultimately pedestrian, documentary. There is something evasive about it as well. Late in the movie, we see Mr. Pizango speaking with the father of a police officer who disappeared amid the violence tied to the protests, and his manner is chilly to the point of calculating — he’s no longer the soulful man of the people that Ms. Brandenburg and Mr. Orzel have been portraying.If this is a genuine side to Mr. Pizango and not just a momentary aberration, it would have been worth looking into. “When Two Worlds Collide” is not rated.

In that movie, Mr. Ferrell and John C. Reilly play best, not terribly bright, friends. Here, again directed by Mr. McKay, they play not terribly bright slackers turned brothers turned friends, who, after their parents wed, generate a lot of noisy, fitfully amusing, ultimately tiresome havoc. They’re losers that only a mother, an entertainment manager or a gang of self-satisfied comedy insiders  could love.The idea of two men of around 40 still living with their folks and addicted to nominally juvenile pursuits (toys, pornography, “Star Wars”) seems like grist for the comedy mill or a newspaper trend piece. Mostly, though, it sounds like an idea that was hatched (Mr. McKay?) in waggish reaction to yet another movie review carping about how American comedies are stuck in adolescence. They are, and have been. (“Hey Abbott!”) What’s distinct about the recent cycle of comic juvenilia are its contemporary contours — male camaraderie and self-actualization combined with raunchy guffaws and a preoccupation with women that doesn’t extend to giving them interesting roles — and the ease with which its prominent practitioners are willing to recycle their own laughs to increasingly diminished ends.So, once again, there is the spectacle and pathos of the sexually stunted immature male, here times two: Brennan (Mr. Ferrell) and Dale (Mr. Reilly). Richard Jenkins plays Dale’s crinkly father, Robert, while Mary Steenburgen, as Brennan’s mother, Nancy, takes the fantasy parent role: she’s saintly, sexy — her relaxed, ready smile telegraphs satisfaction — and endlessly patient. She looks good for a woman who would have had her youngest at about 14. Brennan and his insufferable brother, Derek (Adam Scott), both strong arguments for adolescent birth control, provide some of the crueler sport in “Step Brothers,” evincing mutual hostility that spills over into sadism. It’s hard to reconcile this nice woman with either Brennan or Derek, with his wolfish grin and winner-takes-everything mania.That few girls and fewer credible women are allowed in the Apatow boys’ club is old news. The only distaff comedy here is provided by the enthusiastic Kathryn Hahn, who as Derek’s pitifully desperate wife, Alice, makes dexterous use of a bathroom urinal. Despite this bit of physical comedy, potty humor doesn’t play a large role in “Step Brothers,” which, like all of Mr. Apatow’s films, is firmly, perhaps self-consciously, rooted in what Freudians term the phallic stage of human development, not the anal. The phallic stage is supposed to be the time when little boys realize that little girls are built differently, which leads them to see their fathers as rivals for their mothers and in turn leads to castration anxiety.Castration anxiety, at least in this movie, may explain the startling sight of Mr. Ferrell placing his scrotum (or a remarkably persuasive prosthetic) on a drum during one of Brennan and Dale’s full-rattle battles. The penchant for Apatow men letting it all hang out has become a familiar and much-discussed part of the factory formula. Dudes, I understand: You have penises. You’re nice and sort of blobby and you don’t look like Tom Cruise, but you’re real men. Hot-blooded, anatomically correct men, and no one should ever forget it, least of all the ladies that you can’t stop talking dirty about and hope one day to marry because, well, that’s the kind of good, hot-blooded, anatomically correct guys you are.That’s fine as far as it goes, but recently it hasn’t gone anywhere new. Mr. Ferrell has made a big-screen career riffing on dimwitted innocence, sometimes aided by Mr. McKay’s sitcom styling. Some of their movies have been funny, others less so. Yet successful or not, these characters fit right in with Mr. Apatow’s band of horny and virginal (in spirit if not in flesh) boys and men. In “Step Brothers,” Brennan and Dale almost bring down the house by clinging to a delayed adolescence that makes them seem angry rather than playful and joyous. There’s a shadow of darkness to all their thudding blows and sputtering epithets, but is it the characters who are so fearful of growing up or is it their creators?“Step Brothers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The pleasant surprise of Gareth Evans’s sturdy sequel to “The Raid: Redemption” is that neither its undercover drama nor its two-and-a-half-hour length bog down the bracing, and numerous, fight fests.Iko Uwais returns as Rama, a Jakarta cop who infiltrates a crime syndicate by aiding the boss’s son, Uco (Arifin Putra). Pride and greed push Uco into cooking up turf intrigue with the help of a leather-gloved rival boss, Bejo (Alex Abbad). The story delivers diverse settings (and opponents) for the clobbering-kicking-lunging-shooting melees: in a dated big-box club, at a pornography operation, in a car and between speeding cars. Rama soldiers on through all of it, making clandestine phone calls to his wife.After opening long shots of a rural execution, the fights get bloodier and more brutal, the sadism more overt, and it’s as if we got closer to the violence. But within the daisy-chaining brawls that ensue, there’s also something oddly grounded, even meditative: yeoman’s work by a decent, deadly hero.The Welsh-born Mr. Evans and his skilled crew of combat specialists sustain the movie’s extended warfare with discipline, the alert camerawork staving off the numbness induced by the preceding film. And it all ends with a hard-earned, satisfying signoff that recognizes the limits to the punishment the body can take. “The Raid 2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bloody violence, sexuality and strong language.",0,,,0

SCOTT,Review: ‘Karl Marx City’ Revisits the Everyday Terror of Dictatorship,"“Karl Marx City,” Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein’s unsettling new documentary, is a smart, highly personal addition to the growing syllabus of distressingly relevant cautionary political tales. The volumes currently crowding bookstore front tables — George Orwell’s “1984,” Sinclair Lewis’s “It Can’t Happen Here,” Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism” — offer time-tested prophecies and autopsies of dictatorship. “Karl Marx City” supplements their theories and speculations with everyday facts about life in the supposed workers’ paradise of the German Democratic Republic.Ms. Epperlein grew up there, in the city once (and once again) known as Chemnitz, which East Germany rulers renamed after the father of their ideology. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (as the Communists were officially known) conceived Karl-Marx-Stadt as a showcase of productivity and prosperity, an industrial powerhouse devoted to the supremacy of the East German proletariat.After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Ms. Epperlein made her way to the West. She and Mr. Tucker, an American-born filmmaker, together made a series of tough-minded, intellectually curious shorts and features, including “Gunner Palace” (2005), one of the first documentaries about the Iraq War and still one of the best.In “Karl Marx City,” she steps in front of the camera and returns to her hometown, excavating the zone where family and national history intersect. Accompanied by a third-person voice-over narration — she is not “I” but “she” in her own story — Ms. Epperlein interviews her mother and brothers, historians and archivists, members of the Stasi and their victims.That isn’t always an obvious distinction. The Stasi security service deployed hundreds of thousands of East German citizens as spies and informants, creating a climate of near-total surveillance and pervasive paranoia. Stasi agents routinely collected information from colleagues and neighbors, and broke into apartments in search of incriminating evidence. What they usually found, according to one former officer, were hand-copied West German television schedules and overnight bags packed in anticipation of flight or arrest.Ms. Epperlein conducts her inquiry armed with a giant, fuzz-covered microphone and adorned with a pair of heavy black headphones. This equipment looks a bit comical, but its presence is as much a declaration of ethical principles as an arresting visual joke. The Stasi took pictures and made recordings in secret; its surveillance was stealthy, invisible. Ms. Epperlein — who with her cropped blond hair and regal bearing resembles Robin Wright in “House of Cards” — becomes a walking emblem of honesty and transparency, an embodiment of the documentary ideal.In addition to illuminating the inner workings of everyday political terror, she tries to shed light on a family tragedy. In 1999, 10 years after the collapse of East German communism, Ms. Epperlein’s father committed suicide. Fifteen years after that, his only daughter forces herself to confront the awful possibility that he might have collaborated with the Stasi. So many people did.The mystery of her father’s life and death provides “Karl Marx City” with suspense, and with a concrete sense of profound moral and emotional stakes. Repressive regimes excel at creating ambiguity, at making complicity easier than resistance and at blurring the lines between heroes and villains. Ms. Epperlein and Mr. Tucker, shooting in black and white and making judicious use of historical footage, brilliantly evoke a landscape of gray areas. They also uncover glimmers of decency, loyalty and solidarity — the tiny cracks in the totalitarian edifice that foretold its eventual and inevitable collapse.",1,,,0

That’s Kevin Spacey, the benefactor and, more or less, the focus of this entertaining documentary — entertaining for a select audience, which pretty much means fans of theater or Mr. Spacey, or both. I’m both. Your results may differ.“NOW” is ostensibly about the last production of the Bridge Project, an ambitious collaboration of British and American actors that took its work to stages around the world. The effort concluded with “Richard III.” (It played in 2012 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where I saw it.) Fans of “House of Cards” on Netflix will see, as Mr. Spacey acknowledges, the shadings of Frank Underwood in his King Richard.In interviews, Mr. Spacey is generous in his comments, and his journeyman co-stars are generous about him. Still, he remains an enigma. Most absorbing are the electric moments when the camera captures him about to go onstage, sweating, concentrated, in heaven.But the documentary aims to honor the Bridge Project, and that goal is shortchanged. Too little is said about the international nature of the collaboration of British and Americans, or about the varying audiences around the world. And while the cast members are nicely photographed on their travelogue adventures in Qatar and China, those moments aren’t particularly unguarded.What “NOW” does well is explain why these actors love the place- and time-bound quality of live theater, most evident in the troupe’s stop at the ancient Greek theater of Epidaurus. They share a convincing respect for the rituals and bonds this project has let them form; “NOW,” in the end, celebrates a warm and particular type of family values.",0,21500.0,,0

But as demonstrated by “Rejoice and Shout,” Don McGlynn’s documentary history of African-American gospel music, reasonable arguments are nothing compared with the power of voices lifted in song to invoke the Holy Spirit. Your religion or lack of one doesn’t matter. At some point while watching the film, you may feel that music is God, or if not, a close approximation of divinity.This historical survey of the genre draws heavily on the extensive archives of its producer, Joe Lauro, and is grounded in the work of two experts: Anthony Heilbut, who wrote the classic book “The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times,” and Bil Carpenter, whose “Uncloudy Days: The Gospel Music Encyclopedia” chronicles the lives and careers of more than 650 gospel figures. Their analyses are supplemented by the observations of Jacquie Gales Webb, the host of a popular radio program. Mr. Heilbut’s approach is primarily scholarly and historical, and Mr. Carpenter’s is more sociological and political. Smokey Robinson, who introduces the film and offers its closing observations, sets its praiseworthy tone.The ensemble representing contemporary gospel in the film is the Memphis-based Selvy family, a sprawling multigenerational clan whose members are first interviewed sitting in church pews and near the end burst into musical life in a performance featuring the mighty voice of Darrel Petties.“Rejoice and Shout,” which initially seems rambling and digressive, snaps into focus once it begins relating a chronological history of a genre that evolved out of the fusion of plantation work songs and Christian hymns. Black gospel was first recorded at the beginning of the 20th century. The movie credits the Dinwiddie Colored Quartet, a barbershoplike group formed in a Virginia industrial school, with making the first recording in 1902 for the Victor Talking Machine Company.Tracing gospel’s development from there, the movie offers a straight lineage of innovators and followers that soon spreads out like a river delta with an increasingly complex network of branches and offshoots. In many gospel songs the Jordan River is a code name for the Mississippi, and crossing it means escaping slave territory on one side for freedom on the other.The Fisk Jubilee Singers expanded the vocabulary of gospel to emphasize vocal coloration. In the 1930s Thomas A. Dorsey, the Georgia-born Chicago preacher known as the father of black gospel music, organized the first such music publishing company.We hear the Golden Gate Quartet, a highly polished a cappella jubilee group that had the first of a series of hit records in the mid-’30s, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a preacher and guitarist who combined gospel themes with big-band and blues arrangements. Vintage footage shows James B. Davis, the founder of the Dixie Hummingbirds, swapping vocals with its phenomenal lead singer, Ira Tucker, who died three years ago after 70 years with the group. One of the most stirring clips shows the Swan Silvertones, a musically sophisticated ensemble whose crowning glory was the falsetto of its founder and tenor, Claude Jeter.The incomparable Mahalia Jackson, originally a hairdresser from New Orleans and a protégé of Dorsey’s, is shown in a strong, unvarnished performance from “The Ed Sullivan Show.” Her success illustrates a paradox of gospel: She sold millions of records but was barely acknowledged on the pop and R&B charts. To this day, except for an unpredictable mainstream hit like “Oh Happy Day,” by the Edwin Hawkins Singers, black gospel remains largely under the mass-media radar, a commercial category unto itself.The lineage continues with the elaborately outfitted Clara Ward Singers (a stage mother, Gertrude, and her daughters, Clara and Willa); the competing Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and the Blind Boys of Alabama (featured in a 1982 gospel musical, “The Gospel at Colonus”); and the Staple Singers. Mavis Staples, whose comments are woven throughout the film, recalls how in the early days of the civil rights movement, the family, led by her guitar-playing father, Pops, incorporated freedom songs and some Bob Dylan numbers into their shows.The history concludes with the Rev. James A. Cleveland, the renowned choir leader who helped train Aretha Franklin (who is not seen or heard in the film); the Edwin Hawkins Singers; the Winans; and Andraé Crouch, the seven-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, arranger, producer and pastor, and an architect of contemporary Christian music. A major asset of the film is its refusal to use tiny musical snippets; most of the numbers are fairly complete performances.Like nearly every other musical genre, African-American gospel is a continuing dialogue between roots on one side and technological innovation and secular influences on the other. What accounts for its integrity? It must be the inviolable core of faith at its center.“Rejoice and Shout” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild thematic material and incidental smoking.REJOICE AND SHOUTOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Don McGlynn; edited by Frank Axelson; produced by Joe Lauro; released by Magnolia Pictures.

Miller’s “Submerged,” a modest thriller offering glints of talent amid predictable plot threads. Matt (Jonathan Bennett), a military reservist, struggles to raise his faltering younger brother, Dylan (Cody Christian), after the death of their parents. He also covets — and looks out for — Jessie, the daughter (Talulah Riley) of a wealthy businessman (Tim Daly) for whom he is a driver and surrogate son.In short order, Dylan dies of an overdose, and Matt is comforted by the magnate’s mechanic, Hector (Mario Van Peebles). Then an attempted kidnapping of Jessie results in the sinking of an impregnable limousine in an estuary, an injured Matt at the wheel and an unconscious Jessie at his side.In the passenger compartment are their friends: the flighty Amanda (Rosa Salazar), the unstable Todd (Giles Matthey), the sensible Eddie (Denzel Whitaker) and the broody Brandon (Caleb Hunt), all hysterical to a degree and bickering as the oxygen diminishes. If that’s not bad enough, additional threats await them on the surface — one even visits their underwater hell.The script, by Scott Milam, flirts with political convictions, but betrays its seemingly compact premise in the third act, when plot twists disappoint and the story lapses into conventional confrontations. But Mr. Bennett exudes a solid authority, and the aging Mr. Van Peebles demonstrates that he still has some fight left. As for Mr. Miller, he displays an impressive command of the camera, editing and subtle digital effects. He may not yet be ready for big budgets, but he’s getting there.",0,,,0

But whether earnestly addressing the camera or engineering a phone call between Phyllis and her lover of four decades earlier, Ms. Kleine is unable to communicate a point,  about either midcentury sexual mores or stifled suburban wives. A cascade of glamour shots — Phyllis languorous in a hammock or reclining in a field, always precisely posed — is of interest to no one but her relatives.The problem with these my-family-was-messed-up-and-I need-to-share projects is that they require an audience of complete strangers to give a damn. And while we sometimes do, it’s usually because the material is inherently compelling (“Tarnation”) or the filmmaking uncovers truths beyond the template of family therapy (“51 Birch Street”).

Even better, this animated feature from DreamWorks is so consistently diverting and visually arresting that it succeeds in transcending its storybook clichés. The tale has the consistency of baby pablum — it’s nutritious and easy on the gums — but there’s enough beauty and  pictorial wit here from opening to end credits, enough feeling for the art and for the freedom of animation, that you may not care.The panda of the title is Po, a generously proportioned mound of roly-poly black-and-white fun voiced with gratifying restraint by Jack Black. You know the next turn in the road as well as any Disney-and-Pixar-weaned 7-year-old: Po is different, Po has a dream, Po has to struggle and so forth. Po also has a loving father, naturally (and no mother, predictably), a loosey-necked goosey,  Mr. Ping (James Hong), who runs a noodle shop that he hopes his son will take over one day. Po’s unlikely passion for kung fu intervenes, leading him out of the noodle shop and into the metaphoric hot pot, whereupon he kicks, grunts and groans toward his destiny amid the usual clutter of colorful sidekicks and one nasty foe (Ian McShane, grrr).For an ostensible outsider, Po conforms very much to familiar animated-movie type. Like Nemo and the rest of his cartoon brethren, he needs to embark on the hero’s journey, which he does with help from a miscellany of pals voiced by the usual A-  and B-listers. Among those nudging and guiding Po is Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), an ancient turtle with a mellifluous voice and long, liquid neck   who, um, invented kung fu and now serves as the spiritual adviser (Yoda)  to an elite squad, including a kung fu master, the mustachioed red panda  Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), and his students, the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen).The screenplay by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger is ho-hum without being insulting, a  grab bag of gentle jokes, sage lectures, helpful lessons and kicky fights. There is none of the self-conscious knowing that characterizes the Pixar factory,  which makes the whole thing seem either winningly innocent or terribly cynical, depending on your mood and worldview. I’ll go with innocent, at least on first viewing, because while “Kung Fu Panda” is certainly  very safe, its underlying sweetness feels more genuine than not. The Ayn Randesque bottom line of Pixar’s “Incredibles” can be difficult to argue with — namely, if everybody is special, no one is — but the heroic outsider has his own durable appeal, particularly if he’s a great big bouncing ball of fat and fuzz.That outsider is even more irresistible when nestled amid so much lovingly created  animation, both computer generated and hand drawn. The main story, executed via 3-D animation (all done on computers) and directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne, fluidly integrates  gorgeous, impressionistic flourishes with the kind of hyper-real details one has come to expect from computer-generated imagery: photorealistically  textured stone steps, for instance, and fur so invitingly tactile you want to run your fingers through it. One of the pleasures of “Kung Fu Panda” is that instead of trying to mimic the entirety of the world as it exists, it uses the touch of the real. The character designs may be anatomically correct, but they’re cartoons from whisker to tail.In the end, what charms the most about “Kung Fu Panda” is that it doesn’t feel as if it’s trying to be a live-action film. It’s an animation through and through, starting with the stunningly beautiful opening dream sequence, a graphically bold hand-drawn interlude rendered  by James Baxter  that looks like an animated woodblock print with slashes of black and swaths of oxblood red. This opener is so striking and so visually different from most mainstream American animations that it takes a while to settle into the more visually familiar look of the rest of the movie. And while nothing that comes afterward really compares to it, a volley of arrows that falls down like red rain and a delicate  swirl of pink petals come delightfully close.“Kung Fu Panda” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). But not required.KUNG FU PANDAOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne; written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, based on a story by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris; music by Hans Zimmer and John Powell; production designer, Raymond Zibach; visual effects supervisor, Markus Manninen; produced by Melissa Cobb; released by DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Pictures.

By the time the final meal is devoured, you’ll be wanting nothing so much as an antacid.Inspired by similar events in Ms. Coppola’s past, the story fusses around Anne (an overqualified Diane Lane) as she trundles from Cannes to Paris in an old Peugeot. Anne’s husband, a frantic Hollywood producer (a barely seen Alec Baldwin), has been urgently summoned to Budapest. So his amiable French business partner, Jacques (Arnaud Viard), has offered to drive Anne to her destination — via seemingly every notable restaurant en route.What follows is a Michelin-starred commercial for French cuisine gussied up as Anne’s journey of self-discovery. When not inhaling jus d’agneau and crème brûlée — and a cheese basket the size of a small fishing boat — the two visit famous landmarks and exchange flirty glances. But when Anne finally peels off her pantyhose, it isn’t to indulge in a roadside quickie; it’s to repair the Peugeot’s broken fan belt. So practical, these American women!Between promoting her son-in-law’s band and tediously freeze-framing Anne’s amateur snapshots, Ms. Coppola (best known for her riveting 1991 documentary about the making of “Apocalypse Now”) never realizes Anne as more than a bland accessory who lets men tell her what to eat. Unlike Martine (Élise Tielrooy), a forthright Venusian beauty from Jacques’s past.“You’ll never forget your travels with Jacques,” Martine promises, flushed with remembered ecstasies.

And fall he does, for the unknown woman — to borrow the title of another Tornatore film — who wants to sell paintings and other treasures from the villa she inherited. That the mysterious seller insists on communicating by phone or through closed doors probably increases her appeal to a man who makes much of his living looking at things.Virgil and this woman, Claire, circle each other warily — she goes by Ms. Ibbetson at first — in a dance that’s partly about gaining the upper hand and partly about their respective weird habits. Virgil is the kind of aesthete movie character whose cold formality goes hand in glove (he actually wears gloves) with a raging fear of intimacy. He’s an art collector, aided by a swindle that he runs with a raggedy-haired painter buddy, Billy (Donald Sutherland, politely pitching in). From this premise, one might wonder what delicious conspiratorial excesses might have transpired in other hands; for instance, in the art-centered mystery “Trance,” last spring, Danny Boyle ambitiously disassembled his crazy story as fast as he told it. Here the excesses come courtesy of Mr. Tornatore (“Cinema Paradiso”), the Italian filmmaker who sometimes seems to deliver his handsome, vintage 1990s art-house fare by the yard. His latest, which takes place in a generic European city, looks set to introduce a collision of pathologies, or at least some overwrought dueling like his Depardieu-Polanski face-off, “A Pure Formality” (1995). But “The Best Offer” settles in for a dull courtship leading to a bad end. Adding a superfluous drone of intrigue, Virgil keeps finding old gears and doodads at the villa, and he takes them to a technical-whiz friend (Jim Sturgess) who also dishes out romantic advice.Those metal bits gradually take shape as an antique automaton that provides, in its laborious construction and inevitable shape, an unfortunate metaphor for the film. Mr. Rush, ever game to make a pitch, does bring nerve to his mercurial character, tempering a guy who’s often just a jerk, and his heavy features (which rival Kevin Spacey’s in shifting between masklike and animated) receive central attention from the cinematographer Fabio Zamarion’s camera. But Mr. Rush can’t fly far on Mr. Tornatore’s dialogue and workmanlike plotting, and Sylvia Hoeks, as Claire, doesn’t bring a corresponding energy.At one point, Virgil puts down Billy by airily declaring that his work lacks the inner mystery of true art. The film includes its share of imagery from famous paintings whose names roll by in the credits, but the director stages his serviceable gothic mystery premise with the elegance of an auction.",0,85433.0,,0
606,2008-11-21,Happy-Go-Lucky,"Sally Hawkins, Elliot Cowan, Alexis Zegerman, Andrea Riseborough",UK,Mike Leigh,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",English,84.0,118.0,Mike Leigh,2008,7.0,35311.0,92.0,2017-11-02 04:18:08,MANOHLA DARGIS,The Upside of Seeing the Bright Side,"If you know the British filmmaker Mike Leigh’s work — early and later titles like “Bleak Moments,” “Naked” and “Vera Drake” — you may find yourself watching his most recent movie, “Happy-Go-Lucky,” with mounting unease, a tinge of dread. Despite the extraordinary human parade that has passed in front of his lens, laughing and raging, yearning for love and asking for cuddles, Mr. Leigh has never been an artist for whom happy (word or idea) has been an easy fit. Life is sweet, as the title of another of his films puts it with a heart-swelling yes, but it’s also an eternal fight against doom and gloom, the soul-crushing no.The push and pull between yes and no animates all of his work, investing it with narrative tension and a sense of artistic purpose that is, whether overtly articulated or not, also insistently, vigorously left-leaning. The hard-working and often besieged characters who populate his stories live in worlds partly defined, if not wholly circumscribed, by ideology and the state. Nobody mounts a soapbox or whistles “The Internationale” in “Happy-Go-Lucky,” but the film is so closely tuned to the pulse of communal life, to the rhythms of how people work, play and struggle together, it captures the larger picture along with the smaller. Like Poppy, the bright focus of this expansive, moving film, Mr. Leigh isn’t one to go it alone.Played by a glorious Sally Hawkins — a gurgling, burbling stream of gasps, giggles and words — Poppy rides into “Happy-Go-Lucky” on a bicycle, with daytime London and the film’s opening credits slipping past her. She looks lost in thought (not lost) and wonderfully content. The bike soon goes missing (“We didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye,” she murmurs), but Poppy keeps moving forward and dancing and jumping and laughing and nodding her dark, delicate head as if she were agreeing not just with this or that friend but also with life itself. She’s altogether charming or perhaps maddening — much depends on whether you wear rose-colored specs — recognizably human and every inch a calculated work of art.Mr. Leigh’s characters look as if they live in the world rather than in a movie, but are actually painstakingly conceived through an involved and lengthy collaboration between him and his actors that begins with improvisatory rehearsals and results in a tightly structured shooting script. Poppy, short for Pauline, a pixieish 30-year-old partial to bright blues (as if she were dressing with pieces of sky), is one of his most persuasive optimists, though Mr. Leigh tries to obscure her appeal with some early misdirection. Not long after her bike ride, Poppy and some girlfriends materialize at an ear-piercingly noisy club, bouncing in unison to the numbing sonic throb, only to then dissolve together into a silly, girly puddle.Before you can start huffing superiority, Poppy and her roommate, Zoe (Alexis Zegerman, tastily tart to Poppy’s sugar), are joking about Stravinsky and “The Rite of Spring,” a bit of high-cultural name-dropping that feels as if it had been specifically designed to tweak the audience’s class assumptions. Mr. Leigh has a documentarian’s eye for unadorned reality — his people and places look equally lived in — and his dialogue has the ebb and flow, the swells and eddies and logjams of ordinary conversation. His characters often talk in circles instead of direct lines, clucking and offering cups of tea. But the dramatist in Mr. Leigh is always hard at work, aligning his characters for maximum narrative effect and emotional pow.That’s true even if “Happy-Go-Lucky” seems as lighthearted as the bobbing bloom at its center. In some ways, the film feels like a coda to Mr. Leigh’s splenetic 1993 drama “Naked,” about an angry young man, Johnny, with a severe case of logorrhea. Words are weapons for Johnny, who uses them to prop himself up and tear everyone else down, while for Poppy, a primary-school teacher, they’re more of a caress. They’re also invariably outwardly directed (“Bless ’em,” she says with believable habit) and often accompanied by and obscured by hiccups of laughs and giggles. These yelps of joy at first make her seem a touch demented (a bookstore clerk’s silence suggests as much), a prejudice Mr. Leigh is delighted to demolish.Movies sometimes seem made for misery, for rivers of tears, stormy skies and third-act woe. Happiness is for suckers and Disney Inc. But happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and in “Happy-Go-Lucky” it’s also a question of faith. Poppy isn’t a celluloid saint: she lusts like a real woman and nurses plenty of pints to go along with her loneliness. She also betrays herself and her neediness in a series of amazingly paced and played scenes that find her taking weekly driving lessons from Scott (Eddie Marsan, in a boldly repellent turn), a seething lump of rage and resentment whom she soon sends hurtling around the bend. Horribly funny and often just horrible, the lessons distill individual relationships to their stop-and-go lurching essence.Nothing and everything happens in “Happy-Go-Lucky”: Poppy chatters and wanders, teaches and learns. At one point, she takes flamenco lessons (from a sternly funny Karina Fernandez), doing her best to hold a pose that the instructor likens to that of an eagle. But grand poses don’t come naturally to Poppy, who, earlier in the story, dresses up like a chicken to the delight of her students. She’s made of humbler stuff, human stuff, which Mr. Leigh tenderly expresses in a surrealistic interlude that finds her wandering through a garden and arriving at a kind of Joycean nightscape where a visibly disturbed, gibbering homeless man (Stanley Townsend) asks her again and again, “Know what I mean?” “Yeah,” says Poppy, reaching across the abyss. “I do.”“Happy-Go-Lucky” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Expletives.HAPPY-GO-LUCKYOpens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Written and directed by Mike Leigh; director of photography, Dick Pope; edited by Jim Clark; music by Gary Yershon; production designer, Mike Tildesley; produced by Simon Channing Williams; released by Miramax Films.

Children are trafficked in sex slavery by “flesh-cartels.” Sawa (India Eisley) makes it her mission to free them and to avenge her parents’ deaths. She’s aided by her father’s former partner, Karl (Samuel L. Jackson), a cop who supplies her with weapons and plies her with a memory-erasing drug.This nonsensical plot derives from Yasuomi Umetsu’s 1998 anime, infamous for its depictions of child rape. The cartoon is widely cited as an influence on Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill.” This consciously tamed live-action version appears to take the “Sin City” movies as an aesthetic model. Sawa’s loud red and pink wigs leap off the screen against drab backdrops.Furthering the atmosphere of designer slaughter, Sawa shoots the villains with grenade ammo that redundantly explodes the corpses’ skulls. Other pleasantries include Ms. Eisley’s engaging in an elaborate Mata Hari seduction and being tortured with a vat of fryer grease. (Until now, she has been best known for her work in television’s “The Secret Life of the American Teenager.”)Nasty for nastiness’s sake, “Kite” drags to achieve its brief running time; you wonder whether the slow motion is an artistic device or a stalling tactic. Ms. Eisley may be flustered on purpose (Sawa is a traumatized addict), but she has no chemistry with Mr. Jackson, whose phoned-in performance suggests he can relate to his character’s mercenary instincts.“Kite” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds — the physical ones, anyway — heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miike’s “Blade of the Immortal.”Adding a soupçon of sorcery to the genre’s typical vengeance saga, Manji’s immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishi’s screenplay. (As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly — like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed. And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents. But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a “True Grit” connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.It’s also one of the most bonkers. Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry — like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides — and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents. These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal who’s 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves. (A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)Though not nearly as mindful or meaty as Mr. Miike’s 2011 triumph, “13 Assassins,” “Blade” is creatively gory fun. Overlong and over-the-top, the brutality finally becomes repetitive and somewhat deadening; but Mr. Miike has learned a few tricks from his many previous movies, like allowing the camera to sit still and capture the eerie silence that follows a massacre.That stillness is a trademark of Anotsu (Sota Fukushi, terrific), the story’s big bad and also its most beautiful. Languid and slender, with an androgynous pout and a fondness for palest turquoise, the soft-voiced Anotsu leads his renegade army primarily by standing and posing. He doesn’t need to scream or gesticulate; the whole world is his runway.",0,,,0

No, He’s Larry","“Witless Protection,” the third feature film starring Larry the Cable Guy, finds this comedian’s recurring character, Larry, here a small-town deputy, fantasizing about becoming an F.B.I. agent. He plays out his hero fantasies by rescuing a sultry trial witness named Madeleine (Ivana Milicevic, her arrival heralded by hubba-hubba sax music) from the custody of F.B.I. agents who Larry believes are working for the rich crook Madeleine is supposed to testify against in a tax fraud case.Sitcom wackiness ensues, with Larry seesawing between lucid insights (he knows exactly which parts of the F.B.I. handbook the suspect agents are ignoring) and third-grade lunchroom witticisms. (“You’re insane!” “No, ma’am, I’m Larry.”)The film’s writer and director, Charles Robert Carner, is working on a critic-proof franchise and knows it; the slapstick and action set pieces are lame, and its performances range from competent to annoying. As the chief bad guy, Peter Stormare wolfs down acres of scenery; Joe Mantegna, who has a small role as Larry’s brother-in-law, a scuzzball doctor, gnaws what’s left.In a potentially amusing film trivia in-joke, the leader of the F.B.I. agents, played by Yaphet Kotto, is Alonzo Moseley,  the same straight-arrow African-American F.B.I. man that actor played in the 1988 film “Midnight Run.” Unfortunately, Mr. Kotto is given nothing to do but snarl, sputter and serve as the butt of casually racist jokes.“Witless Protection” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

I should actually say “subjects.” As per the title, this fictionalized portrait is a family one. The movie opens in 2005, the year of Beksinski’s death, with him making some wry and libidinous comments about future technology to a man we’ll learn was his biographer. It then jumps back to 1977, and Beksinski (Andrzej Seweryn, unimpeachable, as is the rest of the cast) and his wife and mother walk across a plaza from their own apartment block to an unfinished one, where Beksinski’s adult son, Tomasz, will live. At this point Tomasz is already struggling with mental illness.Beksinski himself, while a painter of apocalyptic, sci-fi landscapes, is a cheerful, sardonic sort. He’s perhaps a little too bluff about Tomasz’s condition. Discussing their son with his wife, he notes, “At least he’s not running around with a razor, threatening to slice up his grandmas.” Tomasz, who is present, retorts, “I only consider knives and razor blades in relation to my own wrists.”Entering the camcorder age, the Beksinskis become relentless chroniclers of their own lives. The director, Jan P. Matuszynski, mixes simulated home-video footage with stealthily virtuosic long-take scenes, including a remarkable one depicting an airplane excursion with Tomasz. The tragedies in this family’s life are nearly constant, but Mr. Matuszynski approaches them with a tone that’s matter-of-fact while also partaking in the particular wry irony that has been a hallmark of Polish cinema since the early 1960s.",1,,,0
611,2011-06-24,Turtle: The Incredible Journey,"Miranda Richardson, Hannelore Elsner, Georgina Verbaan","UK, Austria, Germany",Nick Stringer,Documentary,English,56.0,81.0,Melanie Finn,2009,7.1,775.0,69.0,2017-11-02 04:18:13,MANOHLA DARGIS,"The Call of the Wild, Heeded With Tenacity","The trailer for “Turtle: The Incredible Journey” promises more excitement than you might suspect could be packed into a story about loggerhead turtles, a plucky seafarer with high mileage. Since it played at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was in the documentary lineup, the movie has picked up plenty of goodwill and awards. Last year its director of photography, Rory McGuinness, won a wildlife/nature award from the Australian Cinematographers Society. Given the quality of their work, the special-effects wizards who whipped up some visual wow for the movie, including computer-generated imagery, deserve a share of the applause too.The journey of the loggerhead turtle is, by any measure, an amazing life voyage, one that here reaches from the beaches of Florida to the eerie calm of the Sargasso Sea and the watery speedway known as the Gulf Stream before heading to Africa and then the call of motherhood. It’s a trip that eats up thousands of miles, takes some two dozen years and is fraught with dangers, though sometimes in the movie that threat may be more imaginary than actual, as when a basking shark, the second largest fish in the world, cruises by with its weird wide mouth open, yawning in water and prey. Armed with little teeth, the basking shark feeds on krill and plankton, but its size and cavernous mouth do make for dramatic viewing.And there’s plenty of nail-biting tension in “Turtle: The Incredible Journey,” including in the melodramatic voice-over by Miranda Richardson, so much that you may find yourself volubly rooting for the animal, or “she” as Ms. Richardson calls the movie’s ostensible single turtle. Never mind that the wee hatchling that races on the beach and then swims through the roiling, churning or sometimes spookily dead waters as an older animal may not be the same one that swims by a fast-moving vortex of silvery fish or makes sweet turtle love. Indeed, some of what you see is not real but persuasive computer-generated images — in other words, special effects.Does it matter? If you call “Turtle: The Incredible Journey” an “epic adventure,” as a poster for the movie puts it, perhaps such digital manipulations are no big deal. Yet since it played at Toronto, the movie has often been described as a documentary. Is it? Given the degree of artifice, the movie can sometimes seem closer to a docudrama or what in post-World War II Britain were called story documentaries, films that blended fiction and nonfiction — including actors and studio-set shoots — to appeal to a wider audience. For “Turtle,” the director Nick Stringer shot some scenes with rescued turtles in what, in the production notes, he called “a specially built marine studio.”Mr. Stringer also said that in some scenes “the interactions between the characters were digitally enhanced with the latest in special FX and blue-screen technology.” Videos and information posted online show some of the results. On the résumé on his Web site, mckeewildthings.com, Greg McKee, of Wild Things, writes that the visual special-effects “footage of 3-D ‘wild animals’ ” he helped produce for “Turtle” was so realistic even “expert zoologists” didn’t know what they were watching. He adds, “Besides final modeling and texturing and animation of three photorealistic 3-D hero turtle characters indistinguishable in every way from real turtles, I modeled textured and animated blue sharks and composited and supervised almost 100 photorealistic documentary realism shots.”Manufacturing reality isn’t new in documentaries, and neither are the attendant ethical questions. The field of nature films, for instance, has a long history of massaging and even brutalizing the truth. In his recent book, “Shooting in the Wild: An Insider’s Account of Making Movies in the Animal Kingdom,” Chris Palmer recounts a notorious incident in which filmmakers working on a 1950s Disney True-Life Adventures film forced lemmings off a cliff and even tossed some into the sea. The beat goes on: In a 2009 study on documentary ethics by the Center for Social Media, one wildlife filmmaker admitted to having a rabbit’s leg broken for a scene of one animal hunting another.Using turtles as performers is of course a far more benign manipulation, but is nonetheless troubling. Documentaries always filter and stage reality, and editorial decisions are made with each camera angle and cut. But increasingly convincing digital technologies can make it impossible to know where nonfiction ends and fiction begins. By laying claim to the documentary mantle “Turtle” also lays claim to the truth. Mr. Stringer has said that it would be impossible to follow a single turtle for decades. But the idea that the audience needs one heroic turtle to follow rather than animals in the wild suggests that nature interests us only if it’s as packaged as a Disney animation.In the age of unreal reality television and mockumentaries, it’s easy to shrug off truth claims. But embellishing reality in nature films, digitally or otherwise, for whatever reason (like turning wild animals into characters), does their subjects and audiences a disservice. Parts of “Turtle: The Incredible Journey” were created on a computer, as its credits suggest. But without a disclaimer that explains what’s real and not, how can viewers, including those who may already be skeptical about claims of environmental crises, trust that the whole thing hasn’t been made up? The loggerhead turtle is a threatened species, and one day all we may have left are its computer-generated analogues. Its fight for existence is plenty dramatic already, and is a story worth telling honestly.TURTLEThe Incredible JourneyOpens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Antonio and Orlando.Directed by Nick Stringer; written by Melanie Finn; narrated by Miranda Richardson; director of photography, Rory McGuinness; edited by Sean Barton and Richard Wilkinson; music by Henning Lohner; produced by Sam Taylor, Mike Downey and Sarah Cunliffe; released by SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment and Hannover House.

Tight and tender, this small family drama is so visually expressive that listening is always subordinate to looking.Set in a tiny coal-mining town in western China and arranged in three distinct segments, the film — which the Museum of Modern Art is showing as part of the touring exhibition, Global Lens 2010 — opens as a pretty young woman (Zheng Luoqian) is suspected of sleeping with her boss and takes refuge in an arranged marriage in Beijing. The second segment follows her unemployed brother (Huang Xuan), an aspiring singer, and his efforts to avoid the grip of the mine he detests. And in the final story their elderly father (Luo Deyuan) uses his retirement to pursue his own long-held dream.Tackling major issues — the country’s catastrophic shortage of women, the improbability of economic rescue — in a minor key, “The Shaft” is a triptych of imprisoned desire. Lovers meet in abandoned buildings and on stone stairways, separated from each other by door frames and handrails. Miners cram into descending cages, their progress captured by security cameras. Occasionally the gray-brown countryside softens with milky light or flares with sudden, hopeful color; but the bright hues of a Beijing taxi are a cruel tease. The film’s concluding, poignant image suggests that for some, escape comes only after a lifetime of self-denial and repetitive motion.THE SHAFT (DIXIA DE TIANKONG)Opens on Thursday in Manhattan.Written, directed and edited by Zhang Chi; director of photography, Liu Shumin; music by Guo Sida; produced by Hu Guipu, Kang Jianmin, Xu Bailin, Tao Xingrui, Liu Xiuwen, Zhang Daogang, Wang Yijie, Liu Xinglun and Guo Sai; released by the Global Film Initiative.

But that’s what Mr. Hanks accomplishes in the German filmmaker Tom Tykwer’s easygoing screen adaptation of Dave Eggers’s novel “A Hologram for the King.” This fanciful tale about Alan Clay, an American consultant visiting Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government, has been transformed through the force of Mr. Hanks’s nice-guy personality. His performance elevates an ominous, downbeat reflection on American decline and runaway technology into a subdued absurdist farce with dark geopolitical undercurrents.The movie is set in 2010, when America was still reeling from the financial crisis and months before the beginning of the Arab Spring uprisings that eventually transformed much of the Middle East into a grisly battleground. In the surreal opening scene, Alan walks down a suburban street, loudly singing the Talking Heads song “Once in a Lifetime,” whose narrator asks you to imagine losing your house and your wife. All at once, we have landed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in a topsy-turvy world of technological disruption and hierarchal imbalance.Alan is in a wretched state when he arrives. Broke, depressed, newly divorced and desperate to regain his financial footing, he is acutely aware that his entire future depends on the successful completion of a deal involving the sale of a miraculous invention that suggests the modern equivalent of Aladdin’s magic lamp. Later in the movie, we see a brief, underwhelming demonstration of its wonders.From the moment Alan lands, he encounters humiliating obstacles. The king, he is told, is away but is expected back very soon. But the days drag on, and the lives of Alan and the three-person I.T. support team that preceded him become a Beckettian waiting game.Instead of a modern hotel, Alan finds his assistants languishing in a sweltering tent without air-conditioning or Wi-Fi in the King’s Metropolis of Economy and Trade, a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City. This metropolis, still under construction, consists of mostly empty skyscrapers. The scenes in which he wanders through this desolate ghost city, which seems in a state of suspension, are among the film’s strongest.Jet-lagged and sleep-deprived, Alan tries in vain to find his bearings, while obsessing about a strange lump on his back that he unsuccessfully tries to remove. His tentative surgery on himself leads him to consult Zahra Hakem (Sarita Choudhury, from “Homeland”), a Saudi doctor with whom he develops an unlikely romantic connection.A screen adaptation of “A Hologram for the King” could have taken any of several approaches. It could have been a satire of American provincialism and culture clash in a tech-dependent world, with Alan portrayed as a bumbling, overconfident fool living in the past. But Mr. Hanks’s embodiment of an unflappably positive, if frustrated, American Everyman, who refuses to give up or to surrender his can-do attitude, grounds the movie. Somehow, you suspect, his situation will be resolved by good old-fashioned American know-how.Alan becomes infuriated but never enraged. Confronting disaster, he grits his teeth and puts on an optimistic face. Mr. Hanks, in his best clownish mode, scrunches his features into all manner of amusing grimaces. But even when Alan is on the brink of nervous exhaustion, you trust him to find the answers. The movie’s weaker scenes try to fill in his background and family history with flashbacks, in which we meet his ex-wife and daughter, whose college tuition he can’t afford. His father (Tom Skerritt) bitterly deplores the outsourcing of American jobs to other countries. As a former executive for the Schwinn Bicycle Company, Alan, we learn, once shipped jobs abroad.Much of “A Hologram for the King” feels like science fiction. We’re familiar with pictures of the futuristic towers of Dubai, flickering in the heat. But this partly constructed ghost town in the middle of a desert suggests an outpost in a different galaxy, where Alan and his team resemble a befuddled, less confident Captain Kirk and his crew waiting for the aliens to reveal themselves.Alan’s guide on this faraway planet is Yousef (Alexander Black), a goofy, oddly paranoid taxi driver who is obsessed with loud American rock music. Their scenes come the closest to traditional comedy.“A Hologram for the King” ponders a modern world in the thrall of illusions. Of what essential use is a holographic teleconferencing system, we are never told. In their semireality, the King’s Metropolis of Economy and Trade and the ghostly holograms Alan is selling might just as well be a desert mirage.“A Hologram for the King” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some sexuality and nudity, strong language and brief drug use.

But the film’s distant imagery makes the turbulent waters and muddy inlands feel incongruously placid. The director’s wide frame encompasses vast terrain from a middle vantage point, achieving views and noticing changes over time that a mere passer-by might not.Humor is also embedded in these pretty pictures, much as it was in the documentary “Sweetgrass,” with its radio-miked cowboys. While the faces of the people in Mr. Patiño’s film are too tiny to make out, their voices are clear as day: a pair of fishermen griping about the government or two beach-going friends trading stories about goodies washing up on shore. Mr. Patiño also takes us to a carnival and a horse festival, sudden pockets of activity among the monumental vistas.“Costa da Morte” makes a respectable addition to recent landscape cinema, very nearly quoting Sharon Lockhart’s “Double Tide” and James Benning’s “Casting a Glance.” But in a late shot of outdoor fires at night, the deep infernal reds summon the hand-tinting of some silent-film epic, bringing us full circle from contemporary avant-garde to cinema’s earliest spectacles.",0,,,0

The movie opens on an unusual day at the Colombian outpost of the Belko Corporation: Heavily armed security guards and bomb-sniffing dogs monitor the gates, and send certain staff members back home.Shortly after the workday starts, an announcement over the P.A. instructs the staff to kill two people in the next half-hour — or else more will die at the command of an unseen force who can kill with the flick of a switch. Then metal shutters and walls seal off the building, and the 80 nervous employees realize this isn’t a practical joke but rather a kill-or-be-killed game. The potheads at the bottom of the corporate ladder start screwing things up for everybody, while upper management (Tony Goldwyn, abetted by some twisted minions) takes the homicidal initiative.Directed by Greg McLean (whose 2005 film, “Wolf Creek,” had a similar morbid interest in bullying its audience) from a script by James Gunn (currently relegated to delighting adolescents of all ages with the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise), the movie might have been better served by a director not hellbent on rubbing pretty much every head wound in the viewer’s face. Mr. McLean, perhaps determined to leave no cliché unturned, also wallows in the cheap and hackneyed irony of choreographed slaughter accompanied by Dvorak and Tchaikovsky.The “Animal Farm” meets “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” climax yields some clever twists. But “The Belko Experiment” made me think that maybe it’s time to stop trying to solve the trolley problem (that is, do you sacrifice one life to save five workers from being killed by a runaway train?) and start worrying about the people who invent such conundrums.",0,10164675.0,10166820.0,0

GOLD,Review: ‘Starving the Beast’ Traces the Burdens of Higher Education Defunding,"Academics used to joke that campus politics were so vicious because the stakes were so small. That’s no longer the case, at least where the stakes are concerned, as “Starving the Beast” makes clear.This documentary by Steve Mims describes an ideological war over public higher education that is being conducted state by state. Trying to reframe college as a consumer product, free-market advocates proudly brandish a “disrupt and reform” credo that would apply business-world values and metrics to state universities. If it’s a business — not a public responsibility — then it dovetails nicely with the small-government movement to “starve the beast.”Thus, some states are sharply cutting their university funding, resulting in steep rises in tuition and student fees. And moves to change the very premise of higher education have led to battles on campuses across the country. Mr. Mims reviews the different conflicts in Texas, Louisiana, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Virginia. The film includes interviews with conservative reformers, but Mr. Mims makes no secret that he stands with the traditionalists.As with any introduction to a multifaceted debate, “Starving the Beast” has some gaps. There’s no reference, for example, to the big bang of taxpayer revolts — the 1978 passage of Proposition 13 and its continuing impact on California’s public universities — nor is there enough investigation of individual innovative proposals.Still, as an overview of the issues, the history and the players, “Starving the Beast” makes a powerful survey course, a prerequisite for further studies.",1,,,0

O. SCOTT,"Who Maimed the Economy, and How","As I was watching “Inside Job,” Charles Ferguson’s meticulous and infuriating documentary about the causes and consequences of the financial crisis of 2008, an odd, archaic sentence kept popping into my head. The words come from the second chapter of “The Scarlet Letter” and are spoken in frustration and disgust by an old Puritan woman who watches Hester Prynne, publicly disgraced but without any sign of remorse, making her way from Salem’s prison to a scaffold in its market square. She “has brought shame upon us all,” the anonymous woman remarks. “Is there not law for it?”“Inside Job,” a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime without punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The betrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain.The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject matter make “Inside Job” feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good humor makes his case all the more devastating.He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial services industry in the 1980s and ’90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the real estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly secret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, George W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers.Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson’s camera, less to gloat than to present, once again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long.Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an opening song, “Big Time,” by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the movie’s themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film’s authority. This is not a piece of ragged muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument.The same was true of Mr. Ferguson’s previous documentary, “No End in Sight,” which focused on catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush’s administration just after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject — the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — “Inside Job” offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis.Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson’s questions. Nor do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director’s comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced capitalist countries for the past two decades.Both American political parties are indicted; “Inside Job” is not simply another belated settling of accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and continued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a “catastrophic meltdown” and was mocked as a “Luddite” by Mr. Summers.Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the positions they were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad consumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies paid by the banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in retrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and political confidence, seems inevitable.How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or systemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write laws and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, Mr. Ferguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and membership in the masters of the universe club.When he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in the White House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are complicated! Who could have predicted? I don’t see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. Occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, “You can’t be serious!”But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than “Inside Job.” There are a few avenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on ordinary, non-Wall-Street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect of productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed.This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in “Inside Job” has been so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame.“Inside Job” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive obscenity, though not the verbal kind.",1,4311834.0,3977509.0,0

More than most docudramas about fairly recent events, it is so well written and acted that it conveys a convincing illusion of veracity.Just as there are conspiracy theorists who will never be satisfied with the Warren Commission report on the Kennedy assassination, there are some who passionately believe that Mr. Rather and his producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) conspired to tarnish George W. Bush’s reputation.The Sept. 8, 2004, episode of “60 Minutes II” alleged that family connections enabled Mr. Bush to avoid the draft in the Vietnam era by serving in the Texas Air National Guard. After Ms. Mapes’s failure to authenticate documents indicating that Mr. Bush, during his term of National Guard service, was lax in his duties and went missing, she was fired, and Mr. Rather stepped down as anchorman.Their defenders believe that Mr. Rather and Ms. Mapes and her team were fed to the wolves for political reasons. The movie insinuates that CBS, to avoid further embarrassment and to curry favor with conservatives should Mr. Bush win the election, allowed it to happen. “Truth” doesn’t voice an opinion, and none of its characters express their political beliefs even in private. Still, its treatment of Mr. Rather, who exudes the stately aura of a grand old man, and Ms. Mapes, who was a kind of surrogate daughter, makes it perfectly clear whose side it takes.Mr. Rather’s exit from the anchorman job at CBS, of course, was less momentous than a presidential assassination. But because it coincided with the run-up to a presidential election, it was potentially very consequential. At the time the story aired, Mr. Bush was a little bit ahead of John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, in the polls and the “swiftboating” campaign to discredit Mr. Kerry’s military record had already begun.The movie, written and directed by James Vanderbilt, who is best known as the screenwriter of “Zodiac,” focuses not on Mr. Rather, who is played with a dignified folksiness by Robert Redford, but on Ms. Mapes, whose 2005 book, “Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power” is the basis for the movie.“Truth” which tells Ms. Mapes’s side of the story, is sympathetic, but doesn’t try to exonerate her. Ms. Blanchett, in one of her greatest screen performances, offers a compelling portrait of a driven, high-strung television journalist fearlessly operating in a cutthroat professional climate. She is relentless in tracking down documents that appear to have been written in the early ’70s by Mr. Bush’s commander, Jerry B. Killian, who died in 1984. And when she finally secures an interview with Lt. Col. Bill Burkett (Stacy Keach), an ailing National Guard veteran, who produces incriminating documents that seem to be authentic, her case momentarily seems airtight.The explosive reaction to the story, once it is broadcast, turns “Truth” into a suspenseful detective story in which the minutiae of typewriters, typefaces and word-processing technologies are explored with an increasingly frantic sense of desperation.The most colorful member of Ms. Mapes’s crack team of researchers and interviewers is Mike Smith (Topher Grace) an impatient firebrand with a very short fuse. Other team members include Lt. Col. Roger Charles (Dennis Quaid), a military consultant who worked with Ms. Mapes on the program’s Peabody Award-winning piece on Abu Ghraib, and Lucy Scott (Elisabeth Moss, underused), a Texas journalism professor.Ms. Mapes is the heart and soul of “Truth.” The family breadwinner, she lives in Dallas with her husband, Mark Wrolstad (John Benjamin Hickey), and young son. Ms. Blanchett plays her as fiery-eyed go-getter who pursued the story with a dogged ferocity. Her eyes flashing, she describes a tip linking Mr. Bush to the bin Laden family that went nowhere as “a juicy piece of brisket.”The screenplay brings in her bitter relationship with her abusive father, whose unkind words about her after the scandal breaks incite savage, profane invective from the right-wing bloggers who call her “feminazi” and “witch.” Ms. Mapes has a thick skin but not so thick that she isn’t wounded by her father’s public scolding and asks him to stop speaking out.In a broader and sadder sense, “Truth” portrays network television news as a grim corporate culture obsessed with remaining above the political fray and maintaining an attitude of imperial detachment. Andrew Heyward (Bruce Greenwood), the president of CBS News from 1996 to 2005, is an unflappably cool operator who never raises his voice and maintains a chilly cordiality in the best of times that freezes into ice in the worst. In such a hypercompetitive environment, undercurrents of anxiety and tension of run deep. To combat the stress, a conspicuous amount of alcohol is consumed by both Mr. Rather and Ms. Mapes.“Truth” doesn’t try to resolve mysteries that may never be solved or to drum up paranoia for the sake of extra heartbeats. But it still casts a pall of dread, an ominous sense that people in high places, whether in government or the news media, will stop at almost nothing to protect themselves and their interests. The retaliation against Ms. Mapes and her crew is similar to the smearing of the San Jose Mercury News journalist Gary Webb after his articles about cocaine smuggling and the funding of Nicaraguan rebels by the C.I.A. That story, told in Michael Cuesta’s “Kill the Messenger” (2014), a lesser film than “Truth,” though still a powerful one, sends the same warning. Investigative journalism intended to upset the status quo can be dangerous and costly.Just below the facade of professional decorum in “Truth” run deep currents of fear, suspicion and hatred. In the creepiest scene, Ms. Mapes is interrogated by a panel convened by CBS, whose members treat her with barely disguised contempt. When she eventually lashes out, she seals her own fate. It is a sad ending to a brilliant career.“Truth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language and a brief nude photo.",1,1580106.0,505577.0,0

But she has also clearly had the time of her life. “The Life & Crimes of Doris Payne,” a rough-edged, brief documentary about this octogenarian career criminal, sketches a peppy and beguiling portrait of a convict whose defiant streak of independence has a way of outshining her wrongdoing.By her account, Ms. Payne grew up in West Virginia with an abusive father and began her decades of thievery by stealing to help her mother. The filmmakers, Matthew Pond and Kirk Marcolina, let their charming, quick-witted and resourceful subject relate her exploits, with commentary from a longtime friend of Ms. Payne’s, her daughter, a sheriff, her lawyer and, appropriately, the writer of a screenplay about her life. ImageA recent photo of Ms. Payne, now in her 80s.CreditFilms Transit InternationalConsequences loom: The sympathetic spine of this broadcast-style documentary is her trial, then impending, on charges of stealing from Macy’s in San Diego. (More recently, in April, Ms. Payne was sentenced to two years in jail and two years under mandatory supervision for another theft, in Palm Desert, Calif.)Ms. Payne’s higher-end targets — including jewelry stores in Europe and the United States — easily place her adventures in a realm of escapist fiction, and she confesses to harboring an urge to redress social injustice as she pretends to be one of the rich to steal from them. But among the film’s insider true-crime details, it also becomes clear that her gutsy stance reflects a willingness to say and do whatever is necessary to con her marks. The compressed film’s patchy re-enactments and pop psychology don’t entirely capture this complicated woman, though she is admittedly practiced at evading capture of all kinds.“The Life & Crimes of Doris Payne” has an embarrassment of riches in Ms. Payne’s story, and it’s often a ripping good yarn, but, as a film, it lacks the nimbleness and resourcefulness of its subject.",0,,,1

Her bandmate Malik (John David Washington) proves a faithless boyfriend, and Coco doesn’t split from the group, but does distance herself from it. “You want to rap? That’s fine with me,” Coco’s no-nonsense mother advises. “But from now on you’re going to have to do it between classes.”At the small college where Coco studies accounting, she is led by her friend Julie (Hana Mae Lee) to a poetry class headed by the imperious, glamorous Professor Dixon (Jill Scott) and her handsome, young British-accented teaching assistant Derek (Lucien Laviscount). Both insist to Coco that rap and poetry are different things. She defiantly sets to prove them wrong, only to discover that in a way they’re right.The script by Nicole Jefferson Asher toggles between sharp observations about wordcraft and some “Dynasty”- or Tyler Perry-level soap operatics. RZA’s direction lacks visual personality, but he keeps the narrative moving and elicits strong performances from his cast. The rap battle and poetry slams take place in settings that are brightly lit and — a few tetchy spats between rivals romantic and artistic notwithstanding — relaxed. The dangerous, poverty- and drug-plagued Staten Island from which RZA’s own music sprang feels very far away. But the director’s comfortable approach to his material and its milieu seems unforced, and yields a frequently enjoyable movie.",0,,,0

Its instantly recognizable silhouette conveys a feeling not just of majesty, but also of stillness. It is therefore apt that “Ascent,” written, directed and partly narrated by Fiona Tan, is announced as a “photo film.” All the images in this 80-minute feature are still. They are largely photographs of the mountain itself: in broad daylight, in the dark, covered in snow, in the background of bright panoramas of sunflowers or cherry blossoms.Over more than 4,000 images, Ms. Tan reads from a text — a letter, it seems — as a character named Mary, who addresses her dead partner, Hiroshi. Hiroshi responds in a Japanese-language voice-over read by the actor Hiroki Hasegawa. But the construction of these two characters is less interesting than the observations and histories they impart.Fuji’s place in Japanese culture is illuminated by way of a folk tale about a moon princess — the same story adapted by the Japanese animation master Isao Takahata in his 2014 film, “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.” The presence of Fuji in the monumental Katsushika Hokusai print “Under the Wave Off Kanagawa” (also known as “The Great Wave”)  is discussed, as are the enthusiasm for Hokusai’s artwork in Antwerp, Belgium, in the 19th century, and how Japanese art influenced Vincent van Gogh. “Ascent” also considers why the climactic battle in the 1960s kaiju, or giant-monster movie, “King Kong vs. Godzilla,” was staged in the shadow of Fuji.And yet the movie is long on lyricism and short on data. You learn how much time it might take to hike to the top of Fuji, an activity explored in much detail by both of its characters, but the actual height of the mountain — a volcano still active (fiery events in the 18th century are recalled in the film) — is never mentioned. While the idea of a feature comprising nothing but photographs and voice-overs might sound a little static, Ms. Tan keeps the movie moving, in both senses of the word, with her canny use of dissolves, deliberate camera movement within a frame, and an ingenious soundtrack that often hints that the images might “come to life” at any second. Ultimately, “Ascent” is a genuinely poetic portrait of a place, and various people’s relation to it.",0,,,0
622,2011-08-10,The Help,"Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer","USA, India, United Arab Emirates",Tate Taylor,Drama,English,62.0,146.0,"Tate Taylor (screenplay), Kathryn Stockett (novel)",2011,8.1,378685.0,75.0,2017-11-02 04:18:13,MANOHLA DARGIS,‘The Maids’ Now Have Their Say,"There’s a scene in “The Help,” the new movie based on Kathryn Stockett’s novel, that cracks open the early-’60s world of strained smiles and gentility that rarely leaps out of this big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum. It’s after hours, and Aibileen, a maid played with determined grace by Viola Davis, is going home. Suddenly the bus stops, and a white man orders the black passengers off, explaining that a black man has been shot — except that he doesn’t say black, Negro or colored. In a pool of dreadful night, Aibileen and a young man trade goodbyes and rush off. And then this sturdy, frightened woman starts running as if her life were in danger, because it’s Mississippi, and it is.When she gets to safety, Aibileen learns that the man who has been shot is Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist who was gunned down in Jackson, Miss., on June 12, 1963, in front of his home. His wife and three young children, who were trained to lie on the floor in case of gunfire, found him, and Evers died shortly afterward. Hours before, President John F. Kennedy, spurred on by different national events, including the demonstrations in Birmingham led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had delivered his landmark speech about civil rights. He said we were facing a “moral crisis as a country and a people” and soon introduced legislation that would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the same year “The Help” rises to its teary, insistently uplifting end.If the movie’s director, Tate Taylor, had his way, your tear ducts would be sucked dry by that big finish, emptied out by a pileup of calamities that include a painful romantic breakup, the devastations of cancer and the mighty wailing of an emotionally abandoned toddler. And that’s just what’s ailing the white folks. The black characters have it tough too, no question, and Mr. Taylor includes enough scenes of Aibileen and her best friend, Minny (Octavia Spencer), cleaning white houses and polishing the silver — and cooking meals and tending children and smiling, always smiling, even as they pretend not to hear the insults — to remind you that this is at least partly about backbreaking, soul-killing black labor.Aibileen works hard for one family in Jackson, minding a pale dumpling named Mae Mobley, whose own mother, Elizabeth (Ahna O’Reilly), called Miss Leefolt by Aibileen, scarcely touches the child. Aibileen loves the white babies she helps raise, though that affection comes with so many choking complexities that they can leave her near-speechless, as the promising first scene shows. Did you always think you would be a maid? an off-screen woman asks. Aibileen answers quietly but with matter-of-fact directness, yes: Her mother was a maid, and her grandmother had been a house slave. Did you have dreams of being something else? the unseen woman asks, her voice so guileless and so maddeningly oblivious that it’s a wonder that Ms. Davis, who has been looking directly into the camera, nearly burning right through it, doesn’t sneer.But Ms. Davis keeps her cool even as she warms your heart and does her job, often beautifully. She doesn’t just turn Aibileen, something of a blur in the novel, into a fully dimensional character, she also helps lift up several weaker performances and invests this cautious, at times bizarrely buoyant, movie with the gravity it frequently seems to want to shrug off. She keeps your attention focused on her and Minny even when the story drifts over to Elizabeth and her white friends, who include a segregationist housewife, Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard, energetic in a thankless role), and the far more liberal Skeeter (Emma Stone, uncharacteristically wan). A would-be writer, Skeeter is the one asking Aibileen all those questions.The story, which Mr. Taylor adapted for the screen, involves Skeeter’s attempts to interview Aibileen, Minny and others about their experiences as maids. Skeeter, recently graduated from the University of Mississippi, has returned home to find that Constantine (a frail-looking Cicely Tyson), her family’s longtime maid and the woman who raised her, has disappeared. As Skeeter tries to find out what happened to Constantine — Skeeter’s ill mother, Charlotte (Allison Janney), isn’t saying — she begins a process of discovery. She lands a newspaper job, meets a boy (Chris Lowell) and slowly starts to see her friends for the bigots they are. Alas, she doesn’t cozy up to the only interesting white woman in town, Celia (a winning Jessica Chastain), a bottle blonde shunned by almost everyone but her own maid, Minny.Mr. Taylor handles these story threads ably as he moves from one household to another, from the bright, open plantation where Skeeter lives to the shotgun shacks that Aibileen and Minny call home. Everything looks good, polished to a high industrial gleam. Save for Ms. Davis’s, however, the performances are almost all overly broad, sometimes excruciatingly so, characterized by loud laughs, bugging eyes and pumping limbs. Ms. Chastain and Ms. Spencer make quite the raucous comedy team, and while there’s pleasure in their routine, all that comedy can feel misplaced. They have some genuinely touching moments together when you see two women, each struggling with the burdens of race and class. But just when you think it might get too heavy, Minny starts vacuuming a stuffed bear for some laughs.Born in Mississippi in 1969, Ms. Stockett, a white woman, has suggested that she was somewhat inspired by Demetrie McLorn, a black woman who worked as a maid for her family, who died when Ms. Stockett was 16 and spoke, to judge from the book’s afterword, in dialect. Some readers have objected to Ms. Stockett’s decision to use black dialect that, in the case of Aibileen, is so thick and old-timey (“sho nuff”) that it’s as if Ms. Stockett were trying to channel Mark Twain. Her white characters, by contrast, are mostly written in “correct” English, even Celia, who in less genteel quarters would be called poor white trash. The dialect doesn’t register as weighty in the movie, largely because Ms. Davis’s performance speaks louder than her accent.What does remain, though, is the novel’s conceit that the white characters, with their troubled relationships and unloved children, carry burdens equal to those of the black characters. Like the novel, the movie is about ironing out differences and letting go of the past and anger. It’s also about a vision of a divided America that while consistently insulting and sometimes even terrifying, is rarely grotesque, despite Hilly’s best (worst) segregationist efforts. Inside all these different homes, black and white women tend to the urgent matters of everyday life, like the care and feeding of children. And while every so often the roar of the outside world steals in like thunder, Mr. Taylor makes sure it doesn’t rattle the china or your soul.“The Help” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"There Will Be Lingerie (Singing, Too)","“My husband makes movies,” sings Marion Cotillard, with upswept Audrey Hepburn hair and an air of resignation. We’ll have to take her word for it, since the husband in question — played in a whirl of smoking, shrugging and bravura suit wearing by Daniel Day-Lewis — seems to be busily doing everything but that. His name is Guido, and while his co-workers and admirers call him Maestro, his mastery is purely notional. He made some great films in the past, apparently, but now, in Rome in the mid-1960s, he finds himself in a professional and personal tailspin just as his new project, the vague-sounding epic  “Italia,” is about to commence shooting.“I can’t make this movie,” he sings. Substitute “watch” for “make” and provide your own music. “Nine,” directed by Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Memoirs of a Geisha”) from the Broadway musical  (first staged in 1982 and revived in 2003), is a movie about creative blockage and sexual confusion, but not quite in the way it wants to be. Straining to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos, less a homage to Federico Fellini’s “8 ½” (its putative inspiration) than a travesty.The theatrical version was built around a single set — half soundstage, half cathouse — and a handful of musically serviceable, lyrically grueling songs by Maury Yeston. The movie, written by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella, who died in 2008, adds some new numbers and opens up the scenery and the story, taking Guido and his women into the streets of Rome, to a spa on the coast nearby and into flashbacks evocative of other Fellini movies. Mr. Marshall even touches down at Cinecittà’s Studio 5, where the real maestro plied his hectic trade.Occasionally a flicker of genuine style emerges from all this busy, gaudy fuss. Mr. Day-Lewis does not overdo the Italian-ness, and the sardonic smile playing around his mouth may be a sign of what he thinks of it all. Ms. Cotillard attains a measure of wounded dignity as Louisa, Guido’s former leading lady and much-betrayed wife. She is not spared the striptease obligations that fall to every other female character, but at least her big song is not splintered by the clumsy, mechanical cross-cutting that seems to be Mr. Marshall’s attempt to fuse choreographic energy with cinematic brio.None of the rest of Guido’s ladies are so lucky. It must be said that “Nine” is an impressive feat of casting, with a shocking number of Oscar winners and nominees assembled in the service of its dubious and incoherent cause. Judi Dench is Guido’s costume designer and confidante. Penélope Cruz is his mistress, Carla, a married woman with serious mascara issues. Nicole Kidman is a Nordic actress meant to conjure memories of Anita Ekberg, though sadly she does not walk around with a kitten on her head. Sophia Loren is Guido’s Mamma, and  Kate Hudson is a Vogue reporter who flings herself in his direction.Stacy Ferguson, known to pop-music fans as Fergie,  is Saraghina, the village prostitute who provides the boy Guido with a glimpse of forbidden pleasures. Nice for him. The rest of us watch Ms. Ferguson  stomp and gyrate through a number called “Be Italian,” which, like so much else in “Nine,” resembles a spread in a Victoria’s Secret catalog, only less tasteful. Ms. Hudson, for her part, struts through an embarrassing hymn to “Cinema Italiano” — with inane lyrics about “hip coffee bars” and Guido’s “neo-realism” — that recalls not Visconti or Antonioni (or even the Italian sex farces of the 1970s) but rather those lubricious Berlusconi-esque variety shows that baffle and titillate visitors from other countries who turn on their hotel-room television sets.Those spectacles at least come by their sleaze honestly. “Nine” dresses up its coarseness  in bogus  prestige, which both kills the fun and exposes an emptiness at the project’s heart — a fatal lack of inspiration. The fear of such a void is what animates the Guido character played by Marcello Mastroianni in “8 ½,” a man whose vanity, tenderness and narcissism mirrored Fellini’s own, and whose anxiety at the prospect of failing as an artist and a man made him a vivid and credible hero. That psychological dimension is missing from “Nine,” which never finds a way to communicate either the romantic ardor or the artistic passion that would make Mr. Day-Lewis’s Guido interesting.Instead he just comes off as a jerk, a compulsive liar and seeker of attention — and, in spite of the sports cars, the cigarettes and the occasional run-in with the Roman Catholic Church, not really very Italian at all. The best that can be said about “Nine” is that its affections are sincere, though you could say the same about its hero, who has the misfortune of being in a movie that’s an even worse mess than he is.“Nine” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The story opens with a camera sliding up to a car parked at an angle, with the driver’s door open and the radio blaring in front of a suburban house. Catastrophic economic news has led to a panic, with one executive, Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), running amok. Since the fetching Mr. Coster-Waldau plays the blond bad boy Jaime Lannister on HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” you may expect the worst. The director Andy Muschietti — who shares script credit with his sister, Barbara (who’s also one of the producers), and a third writer, Neil Cross — whittles the story down to its freaky primal nub. One minute, Jeffrey is holding a gun and contemplating the unthinkable with his two young daughters; the next, the girls are five years older and singing a lullaby straight out of “Hellraiser.”The Muschiettis open the movie with “once upon a time,” tipping that “Mama” is a modern fairy tale of sorts. After the girls went missing with their father, their uncle, Lucas (also Mr. Coster-Waldau), initiated a search. Two of his trackers find them in a derelict midcentury-modern home deep in the woods. (Dad remains M.I.A.) It’s a setting that suggests an abandoned Don Draper weekend getaway, save for the two critters scuttling across the floors and atop a fridge, where one hovers over the other like a bird with a chick. Filthy, with matted hair and skinny spider legs, these are the little lost girls, Victoria (Megan Charpentier), and her younger sister, Lilly (Isabelle Nélisse), wild children seemingly headed toward an unhappily ever after.Lucas takes custody of Victoria and Lilly, to the sullen displeasure of his live-in girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Together they move into a house provided by the hospital where the girls are treated. However appealing its cast, the movie sputters in this stretch, partly because it takes time to recover from the shock of Ms. Chastain’s amusingly apt Goth drag (she only looks menacing), with her jet-black accouterments and multiple tattoos snaking around her pale arms. More problematic are the lapses in logic. The filmmakers easily sweep the girls out of their woodland digs, but they stumble with some of the more ordinary scenes.“Mama” began as a wittily unnerving three-minute short about two girls and a maternal creature that the Muschiettis shot to show Mr. Muschietti’s range as a director. Mr. del Toro took notice of their pocket shocker, and while he took only an executive producing credit on the feature-length “Mama,” it fits with the more successful movies he’s signed onto. Mr. del Toro understands that nothing says terror like a home that’s become a rattling cage. And so, once Lucas has been awkwardly dispatched, leaving Annabel home alone with the girls, Mr. Muschietti gets down to shivery business. Ms. Chastain and her excellent child co-stars, an intensely matched set, embody their characters with soulful believability, whether they’re working together or creeping along a hallway solo. Left to their own devices these three initially circle one another warily. Where this reluctant, plausibly uneasy family is headed is obvious, but Mr. Muschietti throws out enough diversions and visual wit to keep you distracted from the predictable turns. In “Mama” horror is intimate, domestic and overtly feminized, so much so that its monster — Javier Botet, from the “(Rec)” Franchise — opens up darkly oozing, Cronenbergian holes in the wall, a striking visual suggesting that the house itself has given birth to the demon. Here the law of the father meets the wounded wrath of the mother.“Mama” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A consistent sense of dread, topped with some dead.",0,71588220.0,71628180.0,0

Conventionally beautiful, that is. “I Dream in Another Language” features lush tropical landscapes and attractive, compelling people, always lit — not quite just so (the filmmakers clearly know better) — with exemplary attention to the most eye-catching detail. It’s delectably watchable.Directed by Ernesto Contreras from a script by his brother Carlos, the movie opens as a young linguist, Martín (Fernando Álvarez Rebeil), enters a remote Mexican hamlet to record the last speakers of a dying language. As it happens, they are two old men who have been enemies for 50 years.One, Isauro (José Manuel Poncelis), is a hermit who speaks only the dying language. The other, Evaristo (Eligio Meléndez), is a well-respected village elder who also speaks Spanish. Their falling-out decades before involved the woman Evaristo married. That woman is long dead, but Evaristo has an attractive granddaughter, Lluvia (Fátima Molina), of whom, he says to Martín, “You lay a hand on her, I’ll kill you.” In the next scene, Martín and Lluvia are shown together in bed.So “I Dream in Another Language” is that kind of movie, too. The story is not without interest, and it touches on a couple of worthwhile themes: cultural erasure and the way religious and provincial prejudices can suppress love. But its treatment of these subjects is perhaps undercut by its conventionality, which even extends to the movie’s left turn into a kind of magic realism late in the story.",0,,,1

SCOTT,"A New Year, and a Last Day Alive","In the early hours of Jan. 1, 2009, Oscar Grant III, unarmed and lying face down on a subway platform in Oakland, Calif., was shot in the back by a white Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer. The incident, captured on video by onlookers, incited protest, unrest and arguments similar to those that would swirl around the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida a few years later. The deaths of these and other African-American young men (Mr. Grant was 22) touch some of the rawest nerves in the body politic and raise thorny and apparently intractable issues of law and order, violence and race. Those matters are hardly absent from “Fruitvale Station,” Ryan Coogler’s powerful and sensitive debut feature, which imaginatively reconstructs the last 24 or so hours of Oscar Grant’s life, flashing back from a horrifying snippet of actual cellphone video of the hectic moments before the shooting. But Mr. Coogler, a 27-year-old Bay Area native who went to film school at the University of Southern California, examines his subject with a steady, objective eye and tells his story in the key of wise heartbreak rather than blind rage. It is not that the movie is apolitical or disengaged from the painful, public implications of Mr. Grant’s fate. But everything it has to say about class, masculinity and the tricky relations among different kinds of people in a proudly diverse and liberal metropolis is embedded in details of character and place.As played by Michael B. Jordan (Vince Howard to devotees of “Friday Night Lights,” though to fans of “The Wire,” he will always be Wallace), Oscar is a case study in confusion, unsure of where he’s going and a source of worry to those who love him. He dotes on his daughter, Tatiana, and seems sincere in his desire — if not entirely steady in his resolve — to stay with her mother, Sophina (Melonie Diaz). His own mother, Wanda (Octavia Spencer), is still able to boss him around, and he spends a lot of the day shopping for her birthday party.There is a natural, easy sweetness to Oscar, but neither Mr. Coogler’s script nor Mr. Jordan’s performance sugarcoats his temperament. He is, for one thing, irresponsible and not always honest, unable to admit to Sophina or Wanda that he has been fired from his supermarket job for chronic lateness. Even after two stints in prison (one visited in the film’s only chronological digression), he is still selling drugs, and his vows to stop have the feel of New Year’s resolutions, inspiring more hope than confidence.A few moments lean a bit too hard on our dread-filled foreknowledge of Oscar’s tragic end. The lost dog he encounters at a gas station might as well have “Metaphor” stamped on its collar. But Mr. Coogler, with a ground-level, hand-held shooting style that sometimes evokes the spiritually alert naturalism of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, has enough faith in his actors and in the intrinsic interest of the characters’ lives to keep overt sentimentality and messagemongering to a minimum. You get the sense that he might have made this movie even if the world had not handed him a terrible true story, and made any day in the life of Oscar Grant into a sad, touching and subtle film.And, in truth, Mr. Coogler has made that movie, even as he has also made one full of anger, grief and frustration. His main intention — and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordan’s — is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions. The radicalism of “Fruitvale Station” lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that “Fruitvale Station” at once exposes and resists.The other characters, the social environment they navigate and the language they speak are treated with a similarly nuanced attention. Sophina and Wanda have their own burdens and distractions, and they deal with Oscar’s shortcomings as well as they can. The streets of Hayward, Oakland and San Francisco and the cars of the BART trains are places of happy chaos and spontaneous solidarity, but also contested spaces where violence often seems close at hand.Even as it unfolds with a terrible sense of inevitability, “Fruitvale Station” is rarely predictable. The climactic encounter with BART police officers erupts in a mood of vertiginous uncertainty, defusing facile or inflammatory judgments and bending the audience’s reflexive emotional horror and moral outrage toward a necessary and difficult ethical inquiry. How could this have happened? How did we — meaning any one of us who might see faces like our own depicted on that screen — allow it?“Fruitvale Station” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Sadly, the latest and least of the “Saw” films is just plain boring and even a little tame  — albeit by the standards of a genre that helped bring the phrase “torture porn” into the lexicon.Directed by David Hackl from a screenplay by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, “Saw V” makes the fatal mistake of taking itself way too seriously. Like a once-popular TV show that degenerates, in its final season, into self-involved soul-searching of interest only to the most devoted, trivia-obsessed fans, the movie seems to think that people care about the “Saw” mythos, as opposed to the “Saw” method of preposterously baroque killing for kicks.Picking up where its predecessor left off, the new film devotes most of its time and energy to a pair of the dullest characters in the history of horror: the law enforcement agents Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Strahm (Scott Patterson).

O. SCOTT,Bittersweet Chocolate on the Pillow,"It’s a tough choice, but if I had to pick the most Wes Anderson moment in “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” it would be the part when inmates escape from a prison using tiny sledgehammers and pickaxes that have been smuggled past the guards inside fancy frosted pastries. This may, come to think of it, be the most Wes Anderson thing ever, the very quintessence of his impish, ingenious and oddly practical imagination. So much care has been lavished on the conceit and its execution that you can only smile in admiration, even if you are also rolling your eyes a little.“The Grand Budapest Hotel,” Mr. Anderson’s eighth feature, will delight his fans, but even those inclined to grumble that it’s just more of the same patented whimsy might want to look again. As a sometime grumbler and longtime fan, I found myself not only charmed and touched but also moved to a new level of respect.There is no doubt that Mr. Anderson possesses a distinctive sensibility and a consistent visual style, and that instead of striking out in new directions, he tends to embroider and elaborate on familiar themes and pictorial habits. You will see many of them here: static, densely packed, fussily composed frames; traveling shots in which the camera glides alongside the characters like a low-flying bird; action sequences that refuse the usual digital hocus-pocus in favor of the older, artisanal magic of stop-motion animation, matte paintings and rear projection. You will also meet eccentric characters possessed by a kind of madcap melancholy, soulful and silly in equal measure. Some of them are played by actors you have seen elsewhere in the Anderson oeuvre, including Bob Balaban, Tilda Swinton and of course (albeit briefly) Owen Wilson and Bill Murray.So yes, a Wes Anderson movie, and hooray for that. At the moment, there are very few American filmmakers with the ability to articulate such an original, idiosyncratic vision and the means to express that vision so freely. There is a lot of integrity here and also a good deal of ambition. This is a movie concerned with — and influenced by — an especially rich and complicated slice of 20th-century European culture, and therefore a reckoning, characteristically playful but also fundamentally serious, with some very ugly history.Throughout, we are in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a mountainous land that cartographers of various eras might have plotted on the distant marches of successive empires — Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, Soviet — or else erased altogether. The main story is rendered in narrow, boxy dimensions that evoke the films of its era, which is the 1930s. But there are two frames around this narrative, which is in effect a flashback within a flashback. We start out in 1985, under a late-Communist gray sky in a town of cemeteries and statues. An aging writer (Tom Wilkinson) shoos away his grandson and recalls the time in 1968 when his younger self (Jude Law) stayed at the nearly empty, Iron Curtain-tacky Grand Budapest Hotel and became acquainted with its elegant and enigmatic proprietor, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham).For his part, Moustafa reminisces about his first days at the hotel, where he was a mere lobby boy known as Zero (Tony Revolori) and the place was dominated by its charismatic concierge, M. Gustave. Portrayed by Ralph Fiennes with high-stepping liveliness and an evocative mustache, Gustave is both courtier and sovereign, a devoted servant to the guests and the capricious, mostly benevolent ruler of the staff. He corrects their slightest lapses of deportment and lectures them endlessly at mealtimes. He is a lover of poetry and also of the elderly women who summon him to their suites, and maybe of a few men as well. Somehow, he is both an ascetic and a sensualist, highly disciplined and completely irresponsible. A thoroughly ridiculous man and at the same time “a glimmer of civilization in the barbaric slaughterhouse we know as humanity.”That phrase occurs twice in the film and is the key to its intentions. In the real 1930s, places like Zubrowka were on the brink of inconceivable barbarism and unprecedented slaughter. A beautiful, fragile Central European civilization was all but demolished, surviving mainly as the ghostly object of nostalgic longing. Mr. Anderson embraces this nostalgia — for a bygone modernity of railway compartments, telegrams and handmade luggage; of louche aristocrats, discreet bellhops and ruddy-faced workingmen; of painting and poetry and psychoanalysis — but he also tries to work through it, to capture some of the vitality and peculiarity of a vanished world.One of his guides in this enterprise is Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), the prolific and celebrated Viennese writer whose physical appearance and mercurial energy Mr. Fiennes pointedly evokes. While not specifically based on Zweig’s work, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” conjures some of its defining traits: quickness, compression and a highly refined sense of the nuances that separate comedy from tragedy.On the surface, there is a lot more comedy. The main plot spins around an elaborate, Tintin-esque caper involving a stolen painting and a clan of vengeful Zubrowkan nobles. (Ms. Swinton plays the matriarch, Adrien Brody her viperous son and Willem Dafoe the fearsome family hit man.) Zero, a refugee from another made-up geopolitical trouble spot, falls in love with Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), a baker’s assistant with a Mexico-shaped birthmark on her cheek. I will refrain from saying too much more about what happens, or about who shows up in what capacity.It’s all a lot of fun, but it isn’t only fun. Or rather, it’s fun in the service of a subtle and sober argument. If Zweig is one of the film’s mid-20th-century, middle-European Jewish patron saints, another is Ernst Lubitsch, the filmmaker who left Berlin for Hollywood in 1922 and whose name connotes a peerlessly suave and humane comic touch. He functions in “The Grand Budapest Hotel” less as an influence — Mr. Anderson is a much sloppier storyteller — than as a point of reference. On two memorable occasions, Lubitsch, without losing his sense of humor, confronted contemporary totalitarianism: in “Ninotchka” (1939), with Greta Garbo as a Soviet agent in Paris, and in “To Be or Not to Be” (1942), with Jack Benny as a Polish actor performing for the Nazis.These films fight tyranny with irony, frivolity and unshakable charm. It goes without saying that those are inadequate and perhaps inappropriate weapons against tanks and secret policemen. But even now, with full, bloody hindsight, we can appreciate the lesson that lightheartedness and laughter can oppose the heavy hand of political oppression.That hand casts an oblique shadow over “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” Hitler and Stalin don’t exist in this kingdom of make-believe, but sudden eruptions of violence and the offhand mention of tragic happenings point toward a profound darkness just outside the frame. Mr. Anderson is no realist. This movie makes a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures. You can call this escapism if you like. You can also think of it as revenge.“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

(He won a best actor Oscar for his pains.) But as much as “Raging Bull” is an exacting portrait of an athlete and his sport, it is not a “boxing movie.”“Hands of Stone,” in which Mr. De Niro plays Ray Arcel, the American trainer who worked with the Panamanian boxer Roberto Durán in the 1970s and early ’80s, is absolutely a boxing movie. A corny and sometimes clumsy one, it scatters pleasures here and there, Mr. De Niro’s alert performance among them.Written and directed by Jonathan Jakubowicz, the film opens at Madison Square Garden in 1971, with Mr. De Niro’s Arcel watching Durán (Édgar Ramírez) fight there for the first time. “Ring sense is an art,” Arcel says in voice-over. “A gift from God that flows out of a fighter like a painting that flows out of an artist.” That level of writing prevails throughout the picture.Mr. Jakubowicz attempts several cinematic nods to “Raging Bull,” including going to black and white during a 1950s flashback. (Arcel’s refusal to play ball with the mob in that period means that he’s risking life and limb by working with Durán in the ’70s.) “Hands of Stone” also tries to replicate the thrills of Mr. Scorsese’s boxing scenes and does not come within swinging distance. The viewer’s sense of who’s winning a match will rely on the swelling or waning of the music.While Mr. Ramírez is excellent at portraying Durán’s cockiness and imposing physicality, the movie struggles to make him a well-rounded character. (Unlike Mr. De Niro’s LaMotta in “Raging Bull,” both Mr. Ramírez and Ana de Armas, as Durán’s wife, maintain their movie star looks over a narrative arc that spans 10 years and the births of five children.) Durán’s dark side, as depicted in this picture, is not inordinately deep — he’s a talented boxer whose lack of discipline leads him to make dumb decisions.The film toils to give Durán’s infamous walk-off from his still-in-progress 1980 title rematch with Sugar Ray Leonard (played here by a charming, bouncy Usher) multiple beams of psychological buttressing. But the incident nevertheless plays out in the movie as it did in real life: as one of the most boneheaded demonstrations of egocentrism by a major athlete in the 20th century.“Hands of Stone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and almost hilariously gratuitous nudity.

The ideas in this densely packed but enlightening film can be challenging, but must be heard.As the economist Thomas Piketty, author of “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” relates on camera, income inequality is at heights unseen since before World War I. Krishen Mehta, a former partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, estimates that 75 percent of multinationals’ profits reside in places like Singapore, Switzerland, Bermuda and Luxembourg. Giants like Amazon and Apple, whose executives are seen being grilled in hearings in London and Washington, are accused of moving profits to other countries and wiping out, for example, independent booksellers while dodging taxes in major client nations.The film floats the notions of the so-called Robin Hood tax (which would impose a small fee on every stock trade) and a shared tax base among prosperous nations, but don’t hold your breath. Stuart Fraser, a former deputy policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, confirms a common suspicion: “Many politicians have the illusion that they actually run their country,” he says, “when actually they run their country within the confines the global financial system places on them.” In other words, folks, the fox is running the hen house.",1,,,0

(Lin Shaye, from “Insidious,” puts in an appearance.)What “Ouija” lacks in wit and originality, it makes up in volume — a trademark of the “Transformers” director Michael Bay, who is one of the producers. The substitution of loud noises for atmosphere couldn’t quell what was at times an audibly dismissive Times Square preview crowd. If only someone had been in charge of quality control.

But the film, by James Cullingham, does include plenty of Fahey’s signature playing. If you didn’t already admire his music, you may be searching for more of it after seeing this documentary.Fahey, who died in 2001 at 61, was a self-taught guitarist and composer, as well as the founder of the Takoma Records label. He explored the music of the rural South (“Blind Joe Death” was a fictitious blues guitarist he invented) and other slices of Americana and fashioned them into a sound all his own.Mr. Cullingham tells Fahey’s story in fragments, mixing archival clips and interviews with Fahey admirers like Pete Townshend of the Who. Don’t look for helpful wheres and whens on the archival material; the intent is more to create a portrait of the man, grainy but with a rich soundtrack.The Fahey film is being shown with “Approximately Nels Cline,” a short look at Mr. Cline, the guitarist and composer, as he creates some of his avant-garde work. (More conventionally, he is also a member of Wilco.) The film, by Steven Okazaki, is not much more than a home video of a recording session, baffling but with an intimate feel.",0,,,1

Sophie replies, “I don’t think there’s such a thing.” She’s right, at least in this case, and the more involved these two become, the more bittersweet “Echo Park” grows.An understated and often charming film, “Echo Park” begins as Sophie is coming off a long-term relationship. She soon meets Alex, who has seen his American dream fade and has decided to sell his house and return to his native England.Their early romance is easygoing, and even the sight of them kicking around a soccer ball can prompt a smile. Catalina Aguilar Mastretta’s script is free of speechifying and delivers just enough story line to keep a plot in motion; words are rarely used when expressions can better convey feelings.Ms. Gummer and Mr. Okungbowa know how to supply those expressions, communicating disappointments and hopes with their eyes and gestures. It’s no surprise to learn that the director, Amanda Marsalis, has a background in photography. Here, in her feature debut, she’s skilled in conjuring moods by using soft images of her actors and their surroundings. The melancholy soundtrack also helps.“Echo Park” isn’t as ambitious as other expiration-date cinematic love affairs like “Before Sunrise” and “Once.” That’s not a knock against it, but an acknowledgment of its more modest goals. As in those movies, the location (here, the Echo Park section of Los Angeles) plays a big part. Curiously, the fact that Alex and Sophie are an interracial couple is barely mentioned. To be sure, though, skin color isn’t the focal point. Instead, this quietly poignant film is exploring what’s below the surface.",0,,,0

The movie focuses on one of his alter egos, Nicholas Barclay, a 13-year-old Texan from a working-class background who vanished without a trace in 1994 and “reappeared” three years later.As if resurrected from the dead, a boy claiming to be Nicholas announced himself in Europe. An impostor who was actually 23, he traveled to the United States, where, despite his French accent and change of eye color, he convinced the family of his false identity. He claimed to have been kidnapped, taken to Europe, where he was tortured, raped and forced to work in a child prostitution ring. The ordeal left him so traumatized, he said, that his memories were blurred.The movie — adapted from Christophe D’Antonio’s authorized biography of Mr. Bourdin, who is now living in western France and is married with children — changes the location of his American escapade from San Antonio to Baton Rouge, La., and Mr. Bourdin’s name to Frédéric Fortin. Fortin’s pseudonym in the film is Nicholas Mark Randall.Marc-André Grondin, the 27-year-old Canadian actor who portrays Fortin, won acclaim playing a teenage misfit growing up in 1960s and ’70s Montreal in the Canadian film “C.R.A.Z.Y.” That brilliant, French-language movie never found a United States distributor despite being showered with Genie awards (the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars).In “The Chameleon” Mr. Grondin works hard to fill out a character the screenplay doesn’t examine in enough depth to bring fully to life. But at least Mr. Grondin’s disturbingly creepy performance offers no pat explanations, and it doesn’t plead for our sympathy. His mysterious character is shown researching Nicholas’s identity on the Internet and shaving his body hair to appear younger. There are brief, scattered flashbacks to his French childhood.Intriguing as it is, “The Chameleon” might have been a much stronger film had it been narrated by its central character and included a lot more of his personal history. His life, before and after his Texas adventure, seems ripe for a sprawling mini-series like “Carlos.” Or if not that, a picaresque serious comedy like “Catch Me if You Can.” In any case, “The Chameleon” feels too small for its subject.From the beginning there is little question that Nicholas is an impostor. But why? The movie barely touches on that question except for its unsatisfying, sentimental conclusion that his con artistry was an appeal for love. If so, the emotional deprivation driving that search is not explored. We see the impostor’s trickery but not the pain driving it. Nicholas uses every manipulative ploy in the book to confound his supposed family and the law. Resisting interrogation, he throws tantrums, collapses in feigned fits of post-traumatic agony, and falls into long silences.Another wrong decision of this film, the English-language directorial debut of Jean-Paul Salomé (“Arsène Lupin”) from a screenplay he wrote with Natalie Carter, is its framing of the story as a police procedural. It is told from perspective of Jennifer Johnson (Famke Janssen), the tough, fictional F.B.I. agent investigating Nicholas’s disappearance. Jennifer, well played by Ms. Janssen, badgers the impostor and his “family” for information as she tries to get to the bottom of what she suspects is the real Nicholas’s unsolved murder.His relatives are a miserable lot. The most stable, his older sister Kathy (Emilie de Ravin), who works in a nail salon, embraces Nicholas with a ferocious protectiveness. His violent half brother Brendan (Nick Stahl), a sneering, hard-drinking bully with a cocaine problem, treats him with contempt while not actually contradicting his claims; he may know something about the real Nicholas’s disappearance that he is keeping to himself.The mother, Kimberly (Ellen Barkin), a drunken, chain-smoking wreck who sometimes shoots heroin, shrinks from the fake Nicholas’s touch and can barely bring herself to look at him. “Just in case you haven’t forgotten, there wasn’t exactly sunshine between you and me,” she snarls. “You made my life hell.” Ms. Barkin is almost unrecognizable as this bedraggled bundle of rage and disappointment. Exploding from deep within, her devastating performance hijacks the film.“The Chameleon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence and profanity.THE CHAMELEONOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Jean-Paul Salomé; written by Mr. Salomé and Natalie Carter, based on the book by Christophe D’Antonio; director of photography, Pascal Ridao; edited by Marie-Pierre Renaud; music by Jeff Cardoni; production design by Martina Buckley; costumes by Susanna Puisto; produced by Cooper Richey, Bill Perkins, Ram Bergman, Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar and Pierre Kubel; released by LLeju Productions.

636,2010-11-03,Ne change rien,Jeanne Balibar,Portugal,Pedro Costa,"Short, Music",French,,12.0,,2005,6.6,56.0,,2017-11-02 04:18:12,MATT ZOLLER SEITZ,"Light and Shadow, and Music on the Wondrous, Dreamy Side","A movie doesn’t have to be busy to be bold.The Portuguese director Pedro Costa’s “Ne Change Rien,” a black-and-white documentary about the French singer and actress Jeanne Balibar that opens on Wednesday at Anthology Film Archives, illustrates this assertion in its opening image of Ms. Balibar and two bandmates performing a slow song, Kris Jensen’s “Torture.”The shot goes on for three minutes without a cut. The camera seems nailed to the floor. Mr. Costa, a chiaroscuro addict, favors shadow over light, so that the image suggests a monochrome silkscreen by a printmaker obsessed with old Blue Note album covers. Acres of coal black are etched by slivers of white light bouncing off instruments and musicians’ clothes and skin. Because the camera is at such a low angle, nearly half the frame is occupied by the ceiling over the musicians’ heads, an inky canvas dotted by spotlights that might as well be stars.Like the planetarium scene in Woody Allen’s “Manhattan,” this opening shot turns a real space into a figurative one. And as it turns out, that’s Mr. Costa’s strategy throughout “Ne Change Rien.” The camera never moves to follow action. A piano has more keys than this film has cuts.Mr. Costa seems to take his structural cues not from narrative cinema, but from recorded music. This is the big-screen digital video equivalent of a live album that mixes finished songs and stop-and-start outtakes: cinema as playlist. The material is assembled not chronologically, but according to a music producer’s intuitive sense of rhythm.Eventually, the title — which translates as “Change Nothing” — comes to seem both a sly joke on Mr. Costa’s one-tableau-at-a-time structure and a declaration of his artistic principles. “Ne Change Rien” is fascinated by repetition, mistakes, awkward silences and the charged, quiet moments before and after performances. And it observes them all with a rapt, unblinking eye. Like Mr. Costa’s elliptical neo-realist dramas about the urban poor (“In Vanda’s Room,” “Colossal Youth”), this movie is a stylistic rebuke to commercial cinema norms, demanding curiosity and patience throughout.Mr. Costa, who has cited Jean-Luc Godard’s “Sympathy for the Devil” (a k a “1 + 1”) as an inspiration for this film, has no interest in providing the expected documentary elements. He says nothing about the life or career of Ms. Balibar, who is the daughter of the physicist Françoise Balibar and the French Marxist philosopher Étienne Balibar and who has acted for Jacques Rivette (“The Duchess of Langeais”) and Olivier Assayas (“Clean”), among other notable directors.The film leaves biography, filmography and discography to Google and Wikipedia. “Ne Change Rien” is about the work, the mix of inspiration and hard labor that performers draw on from moment to moment, an alchemical event that cinema rarely shows.While rehearsing “These Days,” a song with a complex rhythm, Ms. Balibar keeps time by lightly clapping a hand on her knee, then falls behind the beat and apologizes to her chief collaborator, the songwriter and guitarist Rodolphe Burger. Later, while rehearsing the song “Cette Nuit,” she has the same problem.“Don’t slow down when you’re not supposed to,” says an off-screen voice — perhaps her vocal coach. (Mr. Costa doesn’t tell us.)“I have the same problem on the piano,” Ms. Balibar admits.“Stay on this wondrous, dreamy side,” the unseen voice tells Ms. Balibar. She does, and so does the movie.Ms. Balibar performs the title song in an unbroken, tightly framed close-up, lighted by an off-screen spotlight that creates a halo effect akin to an old-fashioned Hollywood glamour shot. And yet it doesn’t come off as an ad for Ms. Balibar’s considerable physical beauty; it highlights the concentration on her face as she tries to stay in the opium-den groove that her smoky voice has conjured. If you were sitting in a nightclub audience instead of standing right next to her, you’d have no idea how hard she was working. Cameras record emotion as well as light.Ne Change RienOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.

Yet she stayed true to her intentions, and the result is a believable character study that may not draw crowds but certainly challenges its two lead actors.ImageDianne Wiest plays a mother with struggles of her own whose daughter has just died.CreditSofian El Fani/FilmRiseDavid Oyelowo, who played the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in “Selma,” portrays a man named Sherwin, whose idyllic-seeming life is derailed by the death of his young wife. This sends him on a sort of pilgrimage to visit her mother, Lucinda, in Maine. They are not well acquainted, though he does know that there was a simmering tension between Lucinda and his wife, a subject tiptoed around during his visit.Ms. Curran, who wrote and directed, could have pulled a dark family secret out of the hat at any point: a dead twin buried in the backyard, sexual abuse by a weird uncle, whatever. That’s what we’ve come to expect in these types of family-excavation stories. But the revelations here are subtle rather than shocking; Ms. Curran has her actors show rather than tell.It helps that the other star, Dianne Wiest, who plays Lucinda, is very good at that sort of thing. Lucinda had her own struggles even before her daughter’s death (Rosie Perez plays her nurse), and now her brand of survivor guilt is very different from Sherwin’s. Ms. Wiest and Mr. Oyelowo probe the pain slowly and convincingly. In the end, you may feel as if you didn’t know enough about either character. Some may consider that a weakness of this spare film, but it can also be viewed as a strength.",0,15138.0,,1

Perhaps burdened by an excess of respect for Paddington Bear’s creator, the children’s author Michael Bond, or maybe just unwilling to deter the built-in market for the inevitable movie-related merchandising, the filmmakers have settled on safe.While going by the books (more than 20 of them since 1958) might reassure their many fans, it’s a disappointingly fainthearted approach to a character who is anything but. Arriving in London as a stowaway from Peru — where a long-ago explorer taught his family to love marmalade and the King’s English — Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) is warily embraced by the Brown family. Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins, decked out in amusing hats and old-lady knitwear) looks at him as she might the baby Jesus, but Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville, doing his best “Downton Abbey” huffy voice) regards him mainly as an insurance risk. Their two children, like most of the supporting cast, barely register as more than superficial cameos.Despite the kid-gloves sensibility, “Paddington” delivers a knockout blend of fluid animation and live action. Erik Wilson’s primary-colored photography zings, painting an ultra-British, storybook city with a serenely vintage feel. (All the nonwhites — except for some Caribbean musicians — seem to be in hiding.) Stringing together a series of mild, bear-in-a-china-shop misadventures, the director, Paul King (who wrote the story with Hamish McColl), honors the books’ gentle spirit with whimsical humor and a genuine sweetness that little ones should respond to.But the film’s emotions are so carefully calculated that Mr. Brown’s transformation from fuddy-duddy to free spirit — and his sticky kumbaya speech at the end — fail to convince. (Even the lone homoerotic joke feels programmed.) And, as the perfect metaphor for the trials of immigrant assimilation, Paddington could have been given more sophisticated and high-stakes adventures without alienating younger viewers: I doubt that the biggest problem facing British immigrants today is how to negotiate indoor plumbing.At the same time, what tykes will make of Nicole Kidman, playing an evil taxidermist loaded for bear, is anyone’s guess. Squished into a white outfit and stacked on towering heels like a nurse in a bondage video, Ms. Kidman seems more a bone thrown to teenage boys than the antagonist in a children’s movie. The little girl sitting next to me at a preview screening was baffled.“Why is she wearing those stupid shoes to climb on the roof?” she wondered. I could have hugged her.“Paddington” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Ear wax is eaten, nose hair is plucked and a tranquilizer dart is deployed.",0,85879985.0,76223578.0,0

With sexual preferences ranging from one end of the continuum to the other — straight (Trieste Kelly Dunn), bisexual (Lydia Hyslop), lesbian (Maggie Ross and Melodie Sisk) — the group has a history that, like the film’s plot, Mr. Clark refuses to overplay.Cradled by bubbly tunes and a tone of wish-you-were-here playfulness, the friends drink, dance, swim and sunbathe with a camaraderie that’s authentically female. Their back stories remain blurry, but their surroundings are crystal clear, photographed by Daryl Pittman in scorching shades of flamingo and lemon, turquoise and gold. The zingy colors and lazy rhythms lock down the film’s lighthearted mood so effectively that the arrival of an on-the-make surfer (played by Michael Abbott Jr.) fails to spike the group’s undercurrents of barely discernible tension.Filmed on Hatteras Island, N.C., “Vacation!” meanders like an endless summer’s day; even its tragic conclusion feels incongruously fragile. Only in one sequence does Mr. Clark show his hand and throw off understatement: a commingling of sex and death that ought to have earned Ms. Hyslop a hazard bonus. I for one will never look at a blender the same way again.VACATION!Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.Written, directed and edited by Zach Clark; director of photography, Daryl Pittman; music by Fritz Myers, songs by Glass Candy; costumes by Danielle McIntyre; produced by Mr. Clark, Mr. Pittman and Melodie Sisk.

O. SCOTT,Lost in Social Minefields Without a Proper Clue,"Few moviegoers are as demanding as young readers confronted with a film adaptation of a book they love. The makers of the “Harry Potter” and “Twilight” franchises live in terror of the judgment of such audiences, who often demand literal fidelity to the text in question. The minor liberties and omissions of the recent movie version of “The Lightning Thief” provoked withering scorn, at least from a certain fifth grader I know. As for “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” — let’s just say that it’s better that I went to the screening alone.Not that the movie, based on Jeff Kinney’s popular series of schoolboy misadventures, departs egregiously from its source. The problem is that in dutifully transferring to the screen Mr. Kinney’s comical episodes — which he illustrates with witty and expressive line drawings — the director, Thor Freudenthal (“Hotel for Dogs”), and the four credited screenwriters have stripped away nearly all the humor, insight and energy. The movie looks drab and drained of color, and can’t even muster the antic buoyancy of an average episode of “iCarly.”The title character, Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon), chronicles his first year of middle school, taking  note of the social anxieties and identity crises that pop up in that hostile and strange environment. At home, there is a scolding mother (Rachael Harris), a distracted dad (Steve Zahn), a mean older brother (Devon Bostick) and a nonverbal toddler, who all provide moments of predictable comedy. The main drama involves Greg’s relationship with his best pal, Rowley (Robert Capron), a tubby, cheery fellow whom Greg rejects for being insufficiently cool.There is nothing wrong with the story itself, but the tone is grating and the pacing sluggish. Episodes that might be howlingly funny on the page turn weirdly gross and sadistic on screen, though young viewers are unlikely to be upset or offended by the occasional bout of bullying or nose picking. They are more likely to be bored, which is much worse.“Diary of a Wimpy Kid” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested).

O. SCOTT,Nothing Keeps Them Apart Except a Continent,"The long-distance relationship is a fact of life for many couples, especially at a time of high unemployment and economic anxiety.“Going the Distance,” which unites its young lovers briefly in New York City before sending one of them out to San Francisco, acknowledges both the difficulty and the comic potential of the arrangement, and does so with enough insight and charm to make you wonder why frequent-flier love is not a more popular theme in romantic comedies.Yes, of course, there have been innumerable dashes to the airport, in which (usually) the guy runs to the gate or onto the plane itself to apologize, propose marriage, or just beg the girl not to go. “Going the Distance,” crisply directed by Nanette Burstein from a better-than-average script by the first-timer Geoff LaTulippe, acknowledges this convention and slyly subverts it. The airport scene happens at the end of the first act, and the guy makes it only as far as the check-in line, where he tells the girl that he will miss her and hopes they can find a way to keep in touch.The two of them — Garrett and Erin, played by Justin Long and Drew Barrymore — live in a universe of quietly lowered romantic and professional expectations. He works in the music industry, she is an aspiring newspaper reporter, and the movie acknowledges the grim circumstances prevailing in both of their chosen fields without being too apocalyptic about it. Garrett has a low-level job at a record label, Erin is an intern at a New York daily before heading back to finish graduate school in California (where she lives with her sister and waits on tables for money), and both of their ambitions are hedged by a sense of diminished possibility.The same is true in matters of the heart. Erin has a bad breakup behind her, while Garrett seems to have bounced from one relationship to another in a state of Seinfeldian noncommitment. After they meet, cute and mean and tipsy, over a video game at a bar, Garrett and Erin head back to his place for bong hits and a hookup that leads to something more, which in turn lands them at the airport. To recap: After 30 brisk minutes, which include a reasonably fresh take on the obligatory dating-in-New York montage — laughter and kisses, Coney Island and Central Park — they have fallen for each other and managed to make the audience care, at least a little, about what happens next.I realize that what I have just described sounds kind of sad, even dreary. And the choices facing Garrett and Erin once the continent comes between them are made all the more painful by dint of being at once petty and hugely consequential. What should they do? Where should they live? You wonder how they can square their desire to be together with obedience to the imperatives of modern American individualism, which bundles paying the rent, finding your dream and meeting your soulmate into an equation that seems seductively simple until you actually try to solve it.Happy solutions to intractable problems are what romantic comedies are supposed to supply, of course, and while “Going the Distance” hardly breaks the generic mold, it has enough honesty and charm to set it apart from most other recent examples. For better or worse, standard elements are all in place. Garrett has a pair of slovenly, foul-mouthed friends (Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day) who offer bad advice and examples of crude-but-sweet male misbehavior that make their pal look like Cary Grant by comparison. Erin has a scolding, loving sister (the razor-witted Christina Applegate) whose version of domestic bliss (a lumpy husband played by Jim Gaffigan, a manic child played by Taylor Schwencke) is an ideal dressed up as a cautionary tale.Erin and Garrett are different, of course, which in most commercial comedies would mean blander and duller. But Mr. Long — who looks like the brainy runt of a litter spawned by Keanu Reeves and Ellen Page, and who is now claiming the pop-cultural ubiquity that seems to be the birthright of every male product of the Judd Apatow/Funny or Die laugh-making conglomerate — is a sensitive and credible match for Ms. Barrymore. She, without making a big fuss about it, has become the most reliably charming and adaptable grown-up movie ingénue since Doris Day, complementing (and quietly outpacing) counterparts as various as Adam Sandler (in “50 First Dates”), Hugh Grant (in “Music and Lyrics”) and now Mr. Long.They are pleasant company: good looking but not too good looking, and funny in the way of real people making jokes rather than comedians doing material. That job falls to Mr. Sudeikis and especially Mr. Day, who delivers a showstoppingly profane monologue on a Manhattan street that is hilarious less for its content than for his berserkly earnest delivery.Ms. Burstein, whose previous films have been documentaries (including the queasy, teasy “American Teen”), infuses even stock situations and tentative plot twists with a low-key, matter-of-fact feeling, allowing a hint of ragged indie sensibility to sneak into this polished studio product. Romantic comedies nowadays tend to be either aggressively coarse or artificially sweet, and “Going the Distance” finds a workable middle ground, freeing its main man from obnoxious puerility and declining to turn his beloved into a latter-day career gal tripping headlong toward the altar.Watching this movie try to balance honesty with the breezy comforts the audience supposedly craves, I could not help but think of Joe Swanberg and Greta Gerwig’s 2008 movie “Nights and Weekends,” in which the co-directors play a couple trying to keep a relationship going in Chicago and New York. That film, modest and improvisatory and diffidently (if not defiantly) noncommercial, is raw and ragged in a way that Ms. Burstein’s could never be. But they seem at least to belong in the same world, a tentative and confusing place where love conquers what it can.“Going the Distance” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

But nothing in Julian Napier’s “Carmen in 3D,” a film of a Royal Opera House production directed by Francesca Zambello, makes a very strong case for donning a pair of Buddy Holly-style glasses and settling in with popcorn for a nearly three-hour swirl of hiked skirts and toreador thrusts.The obvious question is what does that third dimension give you? “Avatar” this ain’t, though there are a few nifty-silly effects: clasped hands that seem to come right into the audience; perspectives that give remarkable volume to figures in the foreground.Perversely, though, when the 3-D really pops, it makes the singers look like holograms. That doesn’t bring viewers closer to the action so much as transport the 19th-century  drama  into the sci-fi realm.Take away the 3-D, and this is a straightforward filming of Ms. Zambello’s straightforward staging of Bizet’s opera. Even if it were in flat, old 2-D, you might wonder why so little had been done to accommodate the camera. The makeup, for example, no doubt reads in the last row of the Royal Opera House balcony, but on screen it mostly looks globby.And while the cast consists of fine singers, there are no marquee names (this is opera and film: the people call out for stars!) and no grab-you-by-the-throat performances. In the title role, the British mezzo-soprano Christine Rice sings with warmth and agility, but she’s saddled with Ms. Zambello’s off-the-rack Carmenisms.Bryan Hymel’s Don José fares better. Though Mr. Hymel wobbles on a few high notes, his singing and acting have a dramatic immediacy. He’s the emotional core of the film, along with Maija Kovalevska as a fresh-faced (she wears her makeup well), sweet-voiced Micaëla.As the film goes along, you mostly forget about the 3-D. What’s best here are the intimate moments, the arias and duets that bring out Ms. Zambello’s talent for making singers connect with the audience and with one another.Still, if you’re in the market for a filmed version of “Carmen,” you might prefer the Metropolitan Opera’s DVD with Elina Garanca in the lead role. It has only two dimensions, but it’s better staged, and Ms. Garanca is wonderful.As for 3-D, a friend suggested that “Tosca” be next: she could leap from her parapet right into the audience’s lap.Carmen in 3DOpens on Saturday nationwide.

643,2010-05-27,Sex and the City 2,"Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall",USA,Michael Patrick King,"Comedy, Drama, Romance","English, Arabic",27.0,146.0,"Michael Patrick King, Candace Bushnell (characters from the book by), Darren Star (television series creator)",2010,4.4,66864.0,15.0,2017-11-02 04:18:11,A. O. SCOTT,Operation Desert Togs,"The first “Sex and The City” movie, which came out two years ago, qualifies as a comedy both because it is somewhat funny and because, according to a more classical definition, it ends, after some reversals and delays, with a wedding. The sequel — which should have borrowed a subtitle from another picture opening this week and called itself “Sex and the City: The Sands of Time” — begins with a wedding and never seems to end. Your watch will tell you that a shade less than two and a half hours have elapsed, but you may be shocked at just how much older you feel when the whole thing is over.The wedding, the characters frequently remark, with the mixture of insouciant mockery and cosmopolitan self-congratulation that seems to have become the hallmark of this weary franchise, is a gay one. Stanford (Willie Garson) and Anthony (Mario Cantone) have made honest men of each other, giving the four main female characters, their male companions and the director, Michael Patrick King, a chance to wink, nod and drag out Liza Minnelli to perform “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).” Her version is in no way superior to the one in “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,” and it is somehow both the high point of “Sex and the City 2” and a grim harbinger of what is to come. The number starts out campy, affectionate and self-aware, but at some point turns desperate, grating and a little sad.Come to think of it, the possibility of sadness, which shadowed this movie’s precursor and the long-running HBO series (if not the Candace Bushnell column in The New York Observer that is the source of it all), has been banished this time out. Happy endings, once achieved, cannot be undone. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Harry (Evan Handler) are the loving parents of two young daughters. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has settled in Brooklyn with her husband, Steve (David Eigenberg), and son, Brady. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is, as ever, the proudly promiscuous publicist, while Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Big (Chris Noth) dwell in a plushly feathered uptown nest. She’s still a writer, he’s still a master of Wall Street, and the real-world knocks that their professions have taken barely register outside an occasional pasted-in line of recession-conscious dialogue. (One of which is spoken by Penélope Cruz.)Not that everything is perfect. Samantha frets about the onset of menopause, and doses herself with hormones and lotions. Miranda has a mean, sexist boss at the law firm, and Charlotte worries that her buxom young nanny (Alice Eve) may have caught her husband’s eye. She’s also stressed out by parenthood.Carrie and Big, meanwhile, endure barbed pity from other couples because of their decision to remain childless. “You mean it’s just the two of you?” a fellow guest at Stanford and Anthony’s wedding asks, incredulous. Yes, it is, and after two years the Prestons — as Mr. and Mrs. Big are more officially known — may be in something of a marital rut.All of which could be perfectly interesting. Good movies have been made of smaller crises, and over the years all of these characters — Carrie and Big in particular — have earned and repaid our interest. At its best the series, a swift half-hour at a time, distilled and defanged the world it represented, giving HBO subscribers a fantasy picture of New York they could both aspire and relate to.The clothes were fabulous, the social pressures and professional ambitions intense, the names aggressively dropped, but at the heart of every episode were four friends who, while they could be competitive, judgmental and mean, could also be relied upon when it really counted to be loyal and supportive. Sex was the tease, the city was the packaging, but the real selling point was always the love among those four wonderful women.If they seem less wonderful now, it isn’t because of slackened effort or diminished charm on the part of the actresses who play them. It is that the movie itself, and perhaps the culture it stands in for, has lost interest and can’t figure out what to do with them as they tiptoe toward middle age. Samantha is the exception, but the whole point of her character is a steadfast resistance to change. So Ms. Cattrall dutifully reprises her trademark outrageousness, come-hithering guys of all ages and sponsoring a decadent girls week out in Abu Dhabi.Is Manhattan really that over? Maybe it is for Carrie and her friends. Time does not stand still on that island, where the party girls of yesteryear are tomorrow’s Ladies Who Lunch. But rather than trying to find a place for Carrie and company on their native ground — which has shifted a little in the recessionary, politicized interval between the series’s heyday and now — “Sex and the City 2” flees into a never-never land that manages to be both an escape from contemporary reality and an off-key, out-of-touch mirror of it.The Emirate to which the four friends repair is an oasis of gilded luxury in a world that has grown a little ambivalent about unbridled commodity fetishism. The longest segment of “Sex and the City 2” consists of a drooling, gawking deluxe tour that would not be out of place in a high-end travel magazine or a hip-hop video. Four white Maybachs greet the ladies at the airport. (The production  could not obtain four  white Maybachs in time for the shoot, so black versions   had to be wrapped in white vinyl and delivered to Marrakesh, which stood in for Abu Dhabi.) They are led through ever more lavish rooms, oohing and ahhing at their amazing good fortune, and assuming you will do the same.Maybe. But the ugly smell of unexamined privilege hangs over this film like the smoke from cheap incense. Over cosmos in their private bar, Charlotte and Miranda commiserate about the hardships of motherhood and then raise their glasses to moms who “don’t have help,” by which they mean paid servants. Later the climactic crisis raises the specter either of Samantha going to jail or the friends having to fly home in coach, and it’s not altogether clear which prospect they regard as more dreadful.That might depend on the in-flight movie. This one is grueling, especially when the action moves to the Middle East.  There are some gestures toward a plot — a stolen kiss, a lost passport, the appearance of a former lover (Aidan, played by John Corbett) — but remarkably little happens, even when Samantha runs into trouble with the local mores.The attempt to be both piously respectful of a foreign culture and to stand up for sexual liberation against repressive tradition may be admirable in principle, but in practice it’s silly and strained. And the trademark quips, never as witty as they might have been, would be unlikely to make you chuckle even if your best friend said them. “Inter-friend-tion”? “Bedouin bath and beyond”? “Lawrence of my labia”?Yes, it’s supposed to be fun. And over the years audiences have had the kind of fun that comes from easy immersion in someone else’s career, someone else’s sex life, someone else’s clothes. But “Sex and the City 2” is about someone else’s boredom, someone else’s vacation and ultimately someone else’s desire to exploit that vicarious pleasure for profit. Which isn’t much fun at all.“Sex and the City” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has the expected, and not terribly fresh, sexual references and situations.SEX AND THE CITY 2Opens on Thursday nationwide.Written and directed by Michael Patrick King, based on the television series created by Darren Star and characters from the book by Candace Bushnell; director of photography, John Thomas; edited by Michael Berenbaum; music by Aaron Zigman; production designer, Jeremy Conway; costumes by Patricia Field; produced by Mr. King, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mr. Star and John Melfi; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

Directed by Peter Galison and Robb Moss, this nebulous yet evocative documentary is galvanized by the consolidation of executive power under the Bush administration and its growing use of the state-secrets privilege in the post-9/11 era.“Secrecy” is equal parts history lesson, meditative essay, didactic poem and call to arms. If the movie follows no single thread of inquiry, nor sustains any argument or research in depth, it nevertheless explores some chilling corridors of the clandestine.“Secrecy” acknowledges the necessity, in principle, of hiding certain types of critical information. In practice, the film finds much to be troubled about, starting with the momentous 1953 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Reynolds that set the legal precedent for the state-secrets privilege and was later revealed to have been founded on dubious grounds.Developing its analysis of what it calls “the modern secrecy system,” a shadowy concept that never quite reveals itself, the movie touches on the push-pull dynamic of the government  versus the press; the culture clash between those shaped by the cold-war paradigm of information hoarding and those alert to the networked sensibility of the Internet era; the private toll of covering up; and the great danger to the public of secrecy for its own sake.SECRECYOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Peter Galison and Robb Moss; directors of photography, Austin de Besche and Stephen McCarthy; edited by Chyld King; music by John Kusiak; released by Redacted  Pictures.

L. James’s erotic best seller “Fifty Shades of Grey.” “Who wrote this, a third grader?” Other trenchant observations pepper “Fifty Shades of Black,” a scattershot satire of the book’s 2015 screen adaptation, but a lot of wading is required to find them.Mr. Wayans, who skewered horror flicks with the “Haunted House” and “Scary Movie” series, has found another ripe subject for pillorying. (At least two stage parodies got to “Fifty Shades,” the novel, first.) But as with other staples of the screen-parody genre, the comic bull’s-eyes arrive only intermittently.“Black” parallels the outline of “Grey” — here, the millionaire, Christian, tries to coax the college student, Hannah (the appealing Kali Hawk), into signing a contract for kinky sex — but only as much as it permits Mr. Wayans to riff on pop ephemera. Fortunately, Mr. Wayans (who wrote the script with Rick Alvarez; Michael Tiddes of “A Haunted House” directed) has dependable support from Jenny Zigrino as Hannah’s lascivious roommate and Florence Henderson — you read that right — as an older seductress.Predictably, there are jokes about over- and under-endowments, body hair (“That’s very sasquatch of you”) and premature ejaculation. An amusing sight gag has Christian announcing, “Let’s break the Internet!” as he caricatures Paper magazine’s photo renderings  of Kim Kardashian by Jean-Paul Goude.The more resonant lines comment on politics, both presidential and racial: In a bar, Christian asks Hannah, “Are you drunk like Donald Trump-running-for-president drunk?” When Hannah is Tased by Christian’s mother (Jane Seymour), he snaps, “How many times do I have to tell you: Black lives matter!”In the end, Christian — whom Hannah at one point calls “a sicko who likes abusing women” — is given his comeuppance. With a sex toy, of course.“Fifty Shades of Black” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual situations. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.",0,,11686940.0,0

Those films examined the moral struggles of military personnel as they conduct missions with clinical precision while far removed from danger. “Drone” sticks to the home front, following Neil Wistin (Sean Bean), a drone pilot on assignments for a covert C.I.A. contractor in Washington State, and Imir Shaw (Patrick Sabongui), a visitor to his home with an ulterior motive.Neil, an alcoholic who hides his actual job from the members of his family, is as removed from them as he is from the citizens in Pakistan he inadvertently kills with a missile controlled from his office. His wife, Ellen (Mary McCormack, solid), is having an affair. His sensitive son, Shane (Maxwell Haynes), bonded with Neil’s father as the old man was dying, while Neil can’t even compose a eulogy. When Imir stops by Neil’s house and offers to buy a boat he has inherited, Neil, touched by his gentle earnestness, invites him over for supper, only to learn that Imir knows Neil’s work history — and lost his wife and daughter in one of Neil’s aerial assaults.The movie opens with a bravura sequence set in Pakistan, and the script, by Mr. Bourque and Paul A. Birkett, worthily strives to balance sympathies between American interests and humans written off as collateral damage. But overheated family confessions meet SWAT team conventions at the climax, and little resonates in their wake.",0,,,0

This Edwardian period piece is set in the Lamorna artists’ colony in the southwest corner of Cornwall, England, in 1913. The painter Winslow Homer would have been hard put to match the majestic images of spindrift flying from crashing waves in a movie that might facetiously be subtitled “Early ‘Downton Abbey’ by the Sea, Manqué.” Lamorna is an elite bohemian paradise where painters set up their easels in nooks overlooking the water and where a naked couple are occasionally glimpsed frolicking in the surf. Benjamin Wallfisch’s lush, misty soundtrack wraps the scenery in a post-“Titanic” musical haze of hovering strings, piano and faraway pipes. But picturesque seascapes are about the only thing to recommend in “Summer in February,” directed by Christopher Menaul from Jonathan Smith’s choppy, underwritten adaptation of his own novel about the amorous shenanigans surrounding the famous equestrian painter Alfred James Munnings (Dominic Cooper). ImageDominic CooperCreditTribeca FilmMunnings, known as A. J., is the colony’s hot-tempered resident star. A brusque, arrogant blowhard, blind in one eye, he regales his fellow artists in a pub with grandiose recitations of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven.” Munnings, who was eventually elected president of the Royal Academy of Art, was a lifelong enemy of Modernism, and he is heard vehemently dismissing Picasso.The story focuses on the romantic triangle of Munnings; his close friend Gilbert Evans (Dan Stevens), a handsome army officer who kept a diary that inspired the novel; and their mutual love interest, Florence Carter-Wood (Emily Browning), a milky-skinned, saucer-eyed equestrian and painter whom Munnings married. For reasons that are never explored, Florence attempts suicide on their wedding night by drinking cyanide. Upon recovering, she mopes enigmatically through the rest of the movie. Aside from being pretty, she is a real drag. Mr. Stevens’s Gilbert could be the twin brother of Matthew Crawley, the sanctimoniously honorable dreamboat Mr. Stevens played in “Downton Abbey”; the two characters have the same sheepish, courtly, bite-your-lip mannerisms that signal noblesse oblige. Just as Gilbert is about to declare his love for Florence, who shows faint signs of reciprocating, he is interrupted. Almost immediately, he is blindsided when Munnings proposes to Florence. Dazzled by his celebrity, she impulsively accepts. But while married to Munnings, she carries on an affair with Gilbert and becomes pregnant. By this time, Gilbert has departed for a job in Nigeria. Munnings, noticing Florence’s condition, denounces her as a whore and sends her into another suicidal funk. The depressed, uncommunicative Florence is the void at the center of the movie, and the blank, inscrutable performance of Ms. Browning (“Sleeping Beauty”) supplies no clues to her inner life. It doesn’t help that Munnings, the only character with a developed personality, is thoroughly dislikable. Compared with the tepid contretemps of “Summer in February,” the soap-opera theatrics of “Downton Abbey” have the depth of Chekhov.",0,,,0

Goats, lizards, cockerels and drug dealers jostle for space and screen time, but the pig reigns supreme. Whether gazing limpidly as a knife is twisted in its heart or gamboling in blissful ignorance of its fate, the porker is always in peril.That’s why Luisito, a k a La Soga, or the Rope, (Manny Perez, also the film’s screenwriter), is the only vegetarian butcher in town. He’s also an enthusiastic government assassin, mowing down bad guys at the behest of his corrupt superior (Juan Fernandez). Frequent, bleached-out flashbacks supply the reason for Luisito’s blood lust: the murder of his father at the hands of Rafa (Paul Calderon), an androgynous villain now ensconced in New York City. But standing between Manny and his faraway prey are the creamy thighs of Jenny (Denise Quiñones), the childhood sweetheart whose return to town has short-circuited Manny’s revenge plans.Filmed on the steamy streets of a town outside Santiago (with a brief detour to Washington Heights), “La Soga” moves with a crazed energy that denies moral nuance. But the banal narrative (based on events in Mr. Perez’s life) is elbowed aside by Josh Crook’s eccentric direction and images that the cinematographer, Zeus Morand, brands with near-poetic intensity. The film’s explicit depictions of regional violence have upset some audiences, but there’s no denying their impact: those butchered pigs are only the beginning.LA SOGAOpens on Friday  in the New York region.Directed and edited by Josh Crook; written by Manny Perez; director of photography, Zeus Morand; music by Evan Wilson; production designer, Jaime Whitlock; costumes by Slobodan Strinic; produced by Mr. Perez, Josh .

At least that’s how most scenes play out in this well-meaning yet nuance-free film.The story, adapted by Hanna Weg from a novel by Dalia Sofer, centers on Isaac (Adrien Brody), an Iranian Jew, and his wife, Farnaz (Salma Hayek-Pinault). It’s 1979 in Iran, and this prosperous and friendly couple are targeted for harassment as the revolution arrives. Isaac is later arrested and tortured while Farnaz struggles to hold the family together. Before long, they plan an escape from the country.Both of the lead actors, and Shohreh Aghdashloo, as Habibeh, a housekeeper, try to offer up some subtlety; the unsteady bond between Farnaz and Habibeh even introduces an idea or two about the difficulties of employer-employee friendships and the gulf separating the rich and the poor.But those scenes aside, the script almost always inserts a speech where a shrug or a smile would do better, and that’s before the intrusive and persistent score telegraphs every emotion it thinks you should be feeling. “They’re coming after us!” Farnaz declares at one point, as we watch the bad guys do just that. Cue the pursuit music.“Septembers of Shiraz,” directed by Wayne Blair and shot on unconvincing sets in Bulgaria, overexerts itself by insisting to the very end that you care about characters whom you probably started to like in the opening moments. It’s a movie whose good heart is outweighed by its heavy hand.KEN JAWOROWSKI“Septembers of Shiraz” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for a few scenes of torture.",0,,,1

The film loses momentum after that, handicapped by Mr. Tapa’s sometimes sketchy screenplay and the limitations of his nonprofessional cast. (His clumsy staging of their dialogue scenes doesn’t help.) But it remains a moving slice of life from a corner of the world usually seen only in news reports or as a mountainous backdrop for Bollywood musicals.Filming in Srinagar, India, the American-born Mr. Tapa — his father is from Kashmir — builds his story around a coincidence: the young thief, Dilawar (Mohamad Emran Tapa, the director’s cousin), steals the purse of an attractive, slightly older woman, Bani, whom he later meets at the office where she works. Without the passport that was in the purse, she can’t return to the United States to continue her studies, leaving her trapped in Kashmir, like Dilawar, by poverty and family ties — and also available to embark on a chaste relationship that’s more than a friendship but not quite a romance.The conflict in Kashmir is left largely outside the frame, glimpsed on television or signaled by the presence of armed police officers on the bridge that gives the film its title. Mr. Tapa concentrates on Dilawar’s adventures in larceny and their repercussions, leading to a cliffhanger ending that echoes “The Graduate.” His neorealist approach, not supported by much technique, gets dreary, but he has an ace up his sleeve: Taniya Khan, the Kashmiri computer science student who plays Bani. Her warmth and quiet acerbity pull you back into the picture whenever she appears.Zero BridgeOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Tariq Tapa; edited byJosée Lajoie and Mr. Tapa; produced by Hilal AhmedLangoo and Ms. Lajoie; released by FilmDesk, Joyless Films and Artists Public Domain.

The film follows him and several of his writers throughout 2014 as they define their new beat.The novelty of watching reporters get high so they can write reviews of the newly legal products gets old quickly, but that’s really just a sideshow in this film by Mitch Dickman. Of more interest are the substantive subjects Mr. Baca and his crew look into, like false claims by dealers about potency. Especially compelling is the phenomenon of parents who bring seriously ill children to Colorado in the belief that marijuana is the cure for what ails them.The film, though, has a maddeningly short attention span, delving just far enough into one subject to whet your appetite before flitting on to the next. That approach extends to a secondary theme: whether the pot beat is just a gimmick, a desperate effort to attract attention and readers.

O. SCOTT,"The Glamorous Life, With All Its Woes","“Beyond the Lights,” Gina Prince-Bythewood’s occasionally silly, frequently stirring romantic melodrama, was originally going to be called “Blackbird,” after the Nina Simone song at its yearning heart. That song, a blunt, anguished, barely metaphorical reckoning with the intimate psychic violence of racism and sexism, is performed several times by Noni, the film’s suffering pop star. The first time is as a young girl (played by India Jean-Jacques) at a South London talent show, where we are introduced to the two forces that will rule her destiny: a stunning vocal gift and a ruthless stage mother.A decade and a half later, Noni — now played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so impressive earlier this year in “Belle” — is a Rihanna-ish diva on the verge of superstardom. She appears, in leather lingerie and lavender hair extensions, in barely-safe-for-work music videos as the sidekick and plaything of a cretinous white rapper named Kid Culprit (Colson Baker, a.k.a. MGK), who is also her kind-of boyfriend. Noni’s mother, Macy Jean (Minnie Driver), controls every aspect of her daughter’s career and personal life, combining the roles of chaperone, manager and pimp.But celebrity can be a lonely state, and Noni, in the glare of her fame, feels invisible, as unloved and unrecognized as Nina Simone’s blackbird. One night, she indulges a self-destructive impulse and is rescued by Kaz (Nate Parker), a Los Angeles police officer who has been assigned to her security detail. As she dangles from a hotel balcony, he says three words that, at least temporarily, restore her will to live: “I see you.”How Noni is seen, and by whom, is the film’s main dramatic concern. It also rests its gaze on Kaz, a thoughtful, stoical fellow whom circumstances frequently conspire to render shirtless. Honest, hard-working and immune to glamour (though not to beauty), he embodies a fantasy of manhood and represents, for Noni, a possible refuge from the frenzy and superficiality of her working life. He also has some symmetrical issues of his own to deal with, notably his father (Danny Glover), a police captain who sees in Kaz the fulfillment of his own thwarted ambition. Just as Noni has been groomed for stardom, so has Kaz been prepared for political glory. A seat on the City Council is coming open, and a tabloid romance with a troubled chanteuse might harm his electoral chances.This is what I meant about silly and stirring, and I meant both as compliments. Movie romances are not supposed to follow the strict conventions of realism, and Ms. Prince-Bythewood’s script contrives enough twists, coincidences and tearful confrontations to produce the necessary gasps, giggles and sniffles. It sprinkles some glittery celebrity cameos among the scenes of earnest striving and ornaments Mark Isham’s emotive score with even more emotive songs, culminating with a second a cappella rendition of “Blackbird.” At that moment, as in quite a few others, “Beyond the Lights” perfectly mirrors the swooning, swirling, unself-conscious access to feeling that pop music can provide.That magic, of course, is the product of an often cruel and impersonal machinery in whose gears aspiring artists like Noni often find themselves caught. The real conflict is not between Noni and Kaz, or even between the two of them and an indifferent world, but rather between Noni’s sense of herself as a singer and the industry that wants to turn her into a slick, packaged, disposable commodity.Kaz, with his collection of inspirational quotations, his hatred of lying and his extraordinary pectoral muscles, holds out the possibility of authenticity and emotional fulfillment. Macy Jean, who started out as the poor, white, single mother of a biracial daughter, insists on the compromises necessary to find security and a measure of power. Other, less nimble movies might simplify Noni’s predicament, forcing her to decide between happiness and fame, which is to say between Kaz and her career.Such a choice is not entirely absent from “Beyond the Lights,” but Ms. Prince-Bythewood has always had a sure sense of the complex interplay of ambition and desire in women’s lives. She showed as much in her debut feature, “Love & Basketball,” which still holds up nicely after 14 years, and also in the made-for-HBO adaptation of Terry McMillan’s “Disappearing Acts,” which is worth seeking out. In those films, as in this new one, facile notions of “having it all” are pushed aside in favor of an attempt to see what kind of bargain might be struck between the needs of the heart and the equally important demands of work and success.Kaz faces these choices, too, of course. But this is very much Noni’s story, and Ms. Mbatha-Raw’s film, and both Mr. Parker and his character seem to recognize that with gallantry and good humor. “Beyond the Lights” may be a fantasy — movies about love, like songs about love, tend to fall into that category — but it is an uncommonly smart and honest fantasy. What it wants us to believe, most of all, is that despite all the ugliness and exploitation in the world of entertainment, the bond between artist and audience is a real and sustaining form of love in its own right. And the movie is marvelous proof of its own argument.“Beyond the Lights” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Language and sex, nasty and sweet.",1,14617945.0,14618727.0,0

Yes, Indeed","Your auto insurance policy probably has clauses specifying whether you are covered for damage from missiles, falling objects, riots, civil war, earthquakes, hail, radioactive contamination, discharge of a nuclear weapon. But it’s time once again to check that it also addresses whether you are insured against accidentally driving onto the set of a “Fast & Furious” movie. If you blundered into the shooting of “Fast & Furious 6,” for instance, you are almost surely walking now: If the flip-your-car-over speedsters didn’t wreck your vehicle, the giant tank surely did.Most of the familiar faces are back for this latest bacchanalia of reckless driving, including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. Toretto is relaxing in fair-weather retirement, living off the big score of the previous movie in the franchise, when he is called back into service, as it were, by Luke Hobbs, the federal agent who both pursues and admires him and his band of renegades.Hobbs is again played by Dwayne Johnson and his biceps, which get enough camera time that you expect the closing credits to include two arm wranglers, one for each. Mr. Johnson has seemingly been in every movie released in the last two years and has a reality television show, “The Hero,” coming on TNT. But he knows how to deploy his half-dozen expressions — the sly grin, the single-eyebrow arch — and is still a welcome sight, where other actors might by this point be overexposed.He also doesn’t hijack this movie the way his character did in the recent “G.I. Joe: Retaliation.” “F&F 6” is still primarily about Toretto and his buddies. It is no spoiler to say that Michelle Rodriguez, seemingly killed off in an earlier film, returns as Letty Ortiz (she’s in the opening credits), Toretto’s tough-as-nails love interest. The gimmick here is that she’s now working for the opposition, mercenaries led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Oh, and she has amnesia and doesn’t remember Toretto.That provides just enough plot to propel the movie from car chase to car chase. The real question here is whether Justin Lin, the director of this film and three of its predecessors, can top himself. The climactic sequence of his “Fast Five” involved a preposterous scene in which racecars towed a giant bank vault through the streets at high speed.Here Mr. Lin offers two tricks. The bad guys have flip cars, sleek machines whose armor-plated front ends are designed so that when they strike another vehicle, it goes spinning through the air. And in a later chase, Shaw and friends pull out a formidable tank that turns any vehicle it encounters into squished scrap metal. These flashy smashies and a climactic sequence, in which the good guys try to prevent Shaw from taking off in an airliner by tethering their cars to it, make the movie a satisfying thrill ride, at least on a par with the earlier installments. A nice twist near the end is well disguised, and a coda hints at what’s to come in Part 7. “Fast & Furious 6” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It’s a dangerous-driving clinic.",0,238700000.0,,0

The first time you see that vision, her character, Emma Recchi, a Russian who’s married into a wealthy Milanese family, is stage-managing the lavish birthday party that opens the film. By the end of this often soaringly beautiful melodrama, which closes with a funeral, Emma’s face will have crumpled into a ruin. But it will also be fully alive, having been granted, like Pygmalion’s statue, the breath of life.“I Am Love,” directed by Luca Guadagnino, tracks that metamorphosis with surging, insistent music by John Adams and a lush visual style that could be called postclassical Hollywood baroque. Since the movie had its premiere last year at the Venice Film Festival, the name Luchino Visconti, the Italian director of operatic narratives about the European aristocracy, including “The Leopard,” has been ritualistically invoked as a touchstone. While Mr. Guadagnino has most assuredly absorbed Visconti into his system, he is also schooled in Alfred Hitchcock’s thrillers, Douglas Sirk’s melodramas and what were once disparagingly called women’s pictures, stories of female suffering and sacrifice, a genre that the critic Molly Haskell memorably associated with “wet, wasted afternoons.”It takes some time for the tears to flow in “I Am Love,” which initially registers as somewhat arid and analytic in its initial near-ethnographic scrutiny of a social class most of us only read about in glossy lifestyle magazines. The film opens with an elaborate Christmastime birthday dinner for the Recchi patriarch, Edoardo (Gabriele Ferzetti), a celebration that requires a fleet of uniformed servants. Working with the cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, Mr. Guadagnino at first lets loose the camera, which prowls around the house, sweeping over the rich interiors, where Emma and her close aide and perhaps only friend, Ida (Maria Paiato), are putting the finishing touches on an affair that has all the intimacy of a coronation.That evening Edoardo  shocks the family by announcing that he’s leaving its  textile business not only to his son, Tancredi  (Pippo Delbono), as expected  — Tancredi is the name of the nephew played by Alain Delon in “The Leopard” —  but also to his grandson Edo (Flavio Parenti). The news startles everyone, though no one offers a critical word, including Edo, an elegant beauty with the wet eyes of a fawn and the casual grace that comes with a lifetime of privilege. A warm, open presence, he comes across as the most sympathetic of the Recchis, initiating our way into a family whose wealth and traditions are so exotic that it’s almost a surprise everyone isn’t wearing period costumes.The sense that you are watching a bygone era is underscored by what later happens to the Recchi family business, a subplot that leads to a sleek boardroom in London and murmurings about globalization. Mr. Guadagnino does better when he keeps his focus on Emma, whose personality is at first obscured by her roles as a young matriarch. Gradually, another woman emerges as if from a sleep, an awakening provoked by her discovery that her daughter, Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher), has fallen in love with a woman. Instead of putting words in Emma’s mouth, Mr. Guadagnino lets his star react to the news as if she were alone without a camera: the beat of her breath changes, and her eyes widen with wonderment.But while Emma’s outward response seems relatively muted, she has been irrevocably shaken. Elisabetta’s declaration augurs an equally profound transformation in Emma, who shortly thereafter begins an affair with a young chef — and Tancredi’s friend — Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini). The initiation of the affair sends Emma into an ecstatic reverie, though Mr. Guadagnino actually seems even more turned on. The liaison begins one day after Emma goes to visit Elisabetta and instead accidentally catches sight of Antonio. Emma secretly follows him, Mr. Adams’s music  accompanying her much as Bernard Herrmann’s music once  attended James Stewart as he tracked Kim Novak in “Vertigo.” (Emma’s hair is styled into a soft scoop that echoes Ms. Novak’s blond swirl in that movie.)The chase ends in a sylvan perch, where Antonio and Emma make love amid a cacophony of bird calls and a flurry of close-ups of luscious flowers being ravaged by insects. It’s a sublimely beautiful interlude and a touch ridiculous, bringing to mind the blooms of a portentous rose bush in D. H. Lawrence’s  “Sons and Lovers” that “expanded in an ecstasy,” a prelude to later forest rutting. Here, the flora and fauna constitute an alternative reality far from the villa that has become Emma’s sarcophagus and which will at last inspire at least one bird to take flight. As the working-class seducer, Antonio serves a Lawrentian stud function, though truth be told, he’s the kind of sensitive beefcake (he cooks and fulfills her sexually) familiar to readers of women’s romantic fiction, who, like Emma, enjoy their afternoons wet and wasted.“I Am Love” is rated R.

After the final credits rolled, and I staggered toward the exit, the booms of explosions still ringing in my ears, I wondered what I could possibly divulge that would spoil the pleasure of an innocent ticket buyer. After all, originality isn’t the point of a product like “Iron Man 3,” which, despite the needless addition of 3-D and negligible differences in quips, gadgets, villains and the type of stuff blown up, plays out much like the first two movies.And so, once again, Tony Stark a k a Iron Man a k a Robert Downey Jr. jokes and poses, wears his superhero suit and flirts with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Stuff blows up, and then more stuff blows up, because that’s what happens when diversions like this hit movie screens around this time of year: chaos reigns, and then some guy cleans it up. The only significant difference between “Iron Man 3” and others of its type is that it is opening a few weeks after the Boston Marathon bombings. It’s an unhappy coincidence that might not be worth mentioning if “Iron Man 3” didn’t underscore just how thoroughly Sept. 11 and its aftermath have been colonized by the movies.The makers of “Iron Man 3” — including the director, Shane Black, who wrote the script with Drew Pearce — could not, of course, have known that their carefully engineered entertainment would open so soon after the Boston attack. Yet the explosions in the movie, as well as its plot elements — among them the threat of terrorist violence, homegrown terrorism, American soldiers and improvised explosive devices — made it impossible not to think about the marathon. When a Los Angeles landmark is blown up on screen, a twist rendered with the usual state-of-the-art digital technology, all I could think was how clean it looked without the pools of blood and grotesquely severed body parts.Not that anyone wants to see that, especially with kids in the theater. (The movie is rated PG-13.) “Iron Man 3” is conspicuously meant to be escapist entertainment (a pathetic conceit, given what it says movie people think about real life — or rather the real lives of their customers). But Mr. Black and his colleagues, like other filmmakers who use the iconography of Sept. 11 and its aftershocks, want to have it both ways. They want to tap into the powerful reactions those events induced, while dodging the complex issues and especially the political arguments that might turn off ticket buyers. The result is that in some movies Sept. 11 — along with Afghanistan, Iraq, terrorism, the war on terror and torture — registers as just a device, at once inherently political and empty, in a filmmaker’s tool kit.“Iron Man 3” uses that iconography in the extreme, with a terrorist figurehead, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), made up to look like Osama bin Laden; a televised execution; Middle East locations; American soldiers; and a complexly choreographed scene of falling bodies. It all looks and sounds familiar, though this is strictly Marvel’s world, with its own rules and reality.The story takes place after the events of “Marvel’s The Avengers” and a battle for New York, with Stark talking in a voice-over: “We create our own demons.” There’s a bunch of plot, the usual special effects and new faces, including Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, a geneticist, and Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, a rich guy with one of those mysterioso organizations that are invariably up to no good.That’s more or less it, give or take a few explosions. Those are loud and generally less impressive than Mr. Pearce and especially Mr. Kingsley, who turn in the sort of engaged performances that Mr. Downey no longer gives in the franchise. The “Iron Man” films turned Mr. Downey into a huge star, but the role has gradually, maybe inexorably, swallowed him. He no longer necessarily does — and probably isn’t asked to do — the hard work of a real performance. With his puckishness and fast motor, he remains an almost ineffably appealing presence. Yet in “Iron Man 3” he essentially functions as the delivery system for a repertory of Tony Stark poses, gestures, expressions and line readings that, with his superhero costume, established the “Iron Man” brand on screen. For his part, Mr. Black made his name scribbling breezy action movies like “Lethal Weapon” and “The Last Boy Scout,” which wed violence to jokes and irony. His only other directing credit is for “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” (the title of a Pauline Kael collection), a cutesy, self-conscious 2005 action flick with Mr. Downey. Jon Favreau, who plays Happy Hogan, Stark’s security man, directed the first two “Iron Man” films and was thought to be in line for this one before he split for another project.Given the industrial makeup and commercial demands of a movie like “Iron Man 3,” it’s hard to know how much Mr. Black brought to it; his touch is largely evident in the banter and perhaps the swinging retro music over the end credits. Before he left as director, Mr. Favreau had already mentioned that the Mandarin would be in the movie.Which brings me to a speech that Steven Soderbergh, who has announced his retirement from filmmaking, recently delivered at the San Francisco International Film Festival on what he sees as the lamentable state of the industry. As it happens, Mr. Soderbergh, whose career has oscillated between small, indie productions and studio fare like the “Ocean’s Eleven” franchise, brought up “Iron Man 3” in his talk. He wondered why a studio would spend so much money to release a big franchise sequel like this: “Is there anyone in the galaxy that doesn’t know ‘Iron Man’ is opening on Friday?” More instructively, he also suggested why studios have become so dependent on big movies, including money, fear, lack of vision and leadership. Studio executives deserve much of the blame for “pushing cinema out of mainstream movies,” as he put it, but “what people go to the movies for” has also changed since Sept. 11.Mr. Soderbergh said he thought that the country still has post-traumatic stress disorder “and that we haven’t really healed in any sort of complete way and that people are, as a result, looking more toward escapist entertainment.”The studios have long made escapist movies, many wonderful. One problem, as thoughtful filmmakers like Mr. Soderbergh and others have expressed with alarm and frustration, is that the big studios have hitched so much of their resources to so-called tent poles meant to keep studios up and going in lean times. As a consequence, it has become difficult for filmmakers to make midlevel studio movies for adults who value thought over action, narrative ambiguity over blunt spectacle. Good big movies are still released and sometimes even produced by the studios. Among the most satisfying films of the past decade are some from “The Dark Knight” and “Harry Potter” franchises, both of which, in their different ways, engage Sept. 11 and the world it made while transporting viewers into fantastical realms.“Iron Man 3,” by contrast, at once invokes Sept. 11 and dodges it, and does so with a wink and a smile. It’s not the first movie to do so, by any means. But the proximity of its highly publicized release to the Boston Marathon bombings simply makes it the latest, most conspicuous example of how profoundly disconnected big studio movies of this sort are from the world in which the rest of us live. The point isn’t that movies like “Iron Man 3” don’t have any business taking on tough issues. The point is that if they are to be worthy of the art, worthy of the audience and its time and its money, worthy of the legacy of those Hollywood movies that comforted and cheered Americans through world wars and bleak times, they should take on the toughest issues — not just exploit them. “Iron Man 3” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Everyone here, it seems, is on the make; information has a price, and cellphones are more reliable currency than the Paraguayan guaraní. At least that’s what Victor (Celso Franco), a pushcart delivery boy, learns when a shady butcher offers him $100 to make seven wooden crates disappear temporarily during a police raid, then reappear when the all-clear sounds. Simple, right?You would think. But as Victor, distracted by the television sets he lusts after and an abrasive friend (Lali González) who wants a cut of the action, trundles his loaded cart through alleys lousy with grabbers and grifters, the film evolves from wryly comedic lark to major-stakes thriller. Flinging obstacles as if they were confetti — a desperate rival for the assignment (Víctor Sosa); a pair of conflicted cops; the cargo’s menacing owners — the filmmakers stage an amazing race that almost absolves an overstuffed plot and an over-reliance on coincidence. All the while, Richard Careaga’s anxious camera skids under tables and peers up uneasily from the cart’s bouncing wheels; it knows that sooner or later we’re going to have to see what’s in those boxes.",1,,,0

He put together a living in a working-class neighborhood of Cleveland, drank to excess and womanized with abandon, siring 16 children with his wife and several more with two mistresses.One of these women had a daughter from a previous marriage whom Mr. Wagner molested. He was arrested, spent five days in jail and, as he tells it in “One Bad Cat: The Reverend Albert Wagner Story,” found himself in his basement one night contemplating the course of his life — and a paint stain on a scrap of wood.He felt the presence of God within and began to paint his fears and loves: scenes of broken families, lynchings, Biblical tableaus, naked women, dissolute men. Continuing at a prodigious pace, Mr. Wagner, who died in 2006, set aside his vices and amassed a houseful of raw, startling images, as well as a growing reputation as an important folk artist.Directed by Thomas G. Miller, “One Bad Cat” brings fresh light to the artist profile not only through his choice of subject, but also by his direct confrontation with the discomforting nature of Mr. Wagner’s work and the cultural complexities entailed when a poor black naïf is celebrated and collected by well-to-do whites.ONE BAD CATThe Reverend Albert Wagner StoryOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Thomas G.

She settles into a seat in a lecture hall where the benefits of lobotomies via thin spike are being extolled, then witnesses a cruel demonstration of another favorite technique, electroshock therapy.“I don’t believe in healing through violence,” she tells colleagues, but, especially since she is a woman, they are dismissive. They assign her to what they think is busywork.She transforms the insult into opportunity, creating a unit in which patients who had been written off are given a chance to express themselves through painting and other art forms. The results are startling.The movie, full of characters behaving erratically, could easily have taken on the aura of a freak show, but the director, Roberto Berliner, somehow stays respectful of the subject matter even while depicting extreme psychiatric conditions. It’s a study of courageous innovation against an entrenched medical orthodoxy.“Our job is to cure patients, not comfort them,” one colleague chastises.“My instrument is a brush,” Dr. Silveira replies curtly. “Yours is an ice pick.”",1,,,0

GOLD,Review: ‘A Space Program’ Adds Whimsy to a Mission to Mars,"“The Martian,” Ridley Scott’s big-budget Hollywood adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel, gave a sense of how a state-of-the-art mission to the red planet might look. Now “A Space Program” offers a decidedly low-tech alternative.As much installation video as documentary, Van Neistat’s film is the record of an extended tongue-in-cheek simulation of a voyage to Mars by the artist Tom Sachs and a crew of assistants that was performed before an amused audience at the Park Avenue Armory in 2012. It comes at the front edge of a boomlet of Sachs openings: a solo show at the Noguchi Museum in Queens next Wednesday, and an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in April.The installation itself paid homage to 20th-century engineering and applied science. From NASA identity cards to excursion module to land vehicle, the Mars project created the components for Mission Control and each phase of the journey out of steel and plywood and found objects. Spacesuits, for example, were made from the Tyvek of many an overnight mailing envelope. “Our space program is handmade,” Mr. Sachs explains, “guided by the philosophy of bricolage.”Whatever else the film carries, it packs some serious whimsy. The Mars landing is handled by an astronaut successfully completing an ancient Atari video game; planetary explorations to gather and dispatch samples feature a handsaw and bottle rockets.

A contempo update of the 1972 Charles Bronson vehicle of the same name (alternately titled “Killer of Killers”), the story pivots on one of those professional assassins in the employ of one of those hush-hush organizations in which men murmur murderous instructions into phones so that other men can die. For a hit man like Arthur Bishop (Mr. Statham), this makes for an isolated if lucrative life that comes with a swank pad, a vintage muscle car and paid nights with the local talent.That existence takes a turn for the vaguely complicated when Bishop, after some messy business with a colleague (Donald Sutherland), forms an unlikely partnership with that associate’s wayward son, Steve McKenna (Ben Foster).  With his complementary buzz cut, hard-body profile and hyperbolic masculinity, McKenna turns out to be a capable if overly reckless sidekick and a rather adorable Mini Me for Bishop in what soon starts to resemble something of a hit-man hookup. Action flicks often bristle with the love that dare not speak its name, as men express themselves through eroticized violence and the usual expressive grunting and grappling, body slamming, inevitable spasms of death and climactic explosions. When Bishop and McKenna begin firing off their guns in tandem, it certainly looks like the start of a beautiful friendship.Yet while the two come across as Mr. and Mr. Smith of the action-flick set, Bishop and McKenna can’t really go the distance, of course, in the don’t ask, don’t tell movie world. So instead, McKenna, on his first solo contract job, lures a gay man home alone with feigned sensitivity and a little dog, and then engages in a sadistic fight to the death that conveys — with the customary physical struggle and  oozing bodily fluids — what cannot be expressed in any other fashion. It’s unclear if the director, Simon West (“Con Air”), and  Richard Wenk, who shares the script credit with the first film’s writer,  Lewis John Carlino,  understand what that scene is about, but its message comes through with blunt, somewhat queasy force.There’s some limited entertainment to be found in a movie as insistently conflicted as “The Mechanic,” but the accretion of sadism, humorlessness and antediluvian sexual politics is finally more exhausting than enlivening. It’s particularly disappointing that Mr. West doesn’t seem to grasp that when a physical specimen as magnificent as Mr. Statham (who, like Mr. Foster, did much of his own stunt work) is onboard, he should be shown in all his grace and glory, from head to toe. Fred Astaire always insisted that his entire body be in the frame when he danced. Fragmenting bodies  through scattershot close-ups and cuts might simulate excitement, but too often, as in “The Mechanic,” it’s a kind of cinematic dismemberment.“The Mechanic” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

For various counterculture idealists, the relatively affordable, low-resolution devices had utopian truth-telling potential. “Here Come the Videofreex,” a concise and informative documentary directed by Jon Nealon and Jenny Raskin, tells the story of one such collective.The Portapak early adopters David Cort and Parry Teasdale stumble upon each other at Woodstock, both of them recording “none of the music” and instead capturing possibly incriminating (in retrospect) pronouncements from shaggy baby boomers. (One hippie drawls that “the parents of the past generation have” made a mess of their kids — the hippie actually uses a barnyard epithet to describe what they’ve done — and one has every confidence that this individual has since heard something similar or worse from his own children or grandchildren by now.) With some like-minded friends and lovers Mr. Cort and Mr. Teasdale created the Videofreex collective. An alliance with media giant CBS is pursued, and proves abortive, but not before the Videofreex capture some galvanizing footage, including an interview with Fred Hampton, the Illinois chairman of the Black Panther Party, conducted weeks before Hampton was killed by the police in 1969.The tools of portable video were such, the members recall, that men and women started at the same learning curve, and women were able to cover the feminist movement in great detail. As financing and transmitting concerns mount, the movie sees the collective mutating from activists to educators and community entertainers. The utopia they envisioned has yet to materialize, to say the least, but seeing their efforts is heartening.“Here Come the Videofreex” is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 19 minutes.",0,,,0

Having made that decision, the filmmakers, including the director Elizabeth Allen and the screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay, appear to have made another: to put their energy into the frequent, Nickelodeon-style scenes of mayhem and gross-out caused by Ramona’s rambunctiousness — involving paint, peanut butter, fire, water and so forth — rather than the somewhat glum connective tissue of family drama and romance.Children may appreciate that choice, though they (and their parents) might not be so happy with the hour-and-three-quarters running time.Adults can appreciate the presence of Ginnifer Goodwin, as charming as always as the girls’ Aunt Bea, and Sandra Oh as Ramona’s glowering teacher. The cast also includes John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan as the parents, an oddly cast Josh Duhamel as Aunt Bea’s man-child love interest, and Hutch Dano as Henry Huggins, whose interest in Beezus may come as a shock to Cleary fans.Parents may also be happy to see a movie for children that doesn’t involve wizards, vampires or action figures that can be bought in the food court. They should be warned, though, that the price of contemporary realism is a story that includes layoffs, bickering and unpaid bills.RAMONA AND BEEZUSOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Elizabeth Allen; written by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay, based on the novels by Beverly Cleary; director of photography, John Bailey; edited by Jane Moran; music by Mark Mothersbaugh; production designer, Brent Thomas; produced by Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan; released by Fox 2000 Pictures and Walden Media.

Dirty, disheveled, in full distressed costume and character, and within easy sloshing reach of a bottle, he looks lost and alone, much like all the human detritus that washes up in every city and remains mostly unnoticed. But there’s no ignoring Hancock, who has amazing powers. He can fly, for starters, and soon enough he’s blasting straight into the heavens, the first homeless superhero in movies  —  Superbum!Alas (bummer), though he can look the part, Hancock isn’t literally homeless, just rootless, troubled and bedeviled. He drinks hard, swears at children (who curse him in turn), rarely shaves, never smiles. Worse, he has lousy superhero style, with sneakers and shorts (no cape), a grubby watch cap pulled over his forehead and buggy sunglasses that hide his (X-ray?) eyes. His takeoffs and landings are a mess: sloppy and violent, they invariably leave a heap of trouble and general rubble in his wake. He’s Pothole Man, Train Wreck Man, but mainly he’s Seriously Ticked Off Man, which, given that he’s also a black man in Los Angeles, suggests that this superhero story comes with some bite, even a few nibbling sharp teeth.Although whatever teeth it had have mostly been pulled, “Hancock” makes for one unexpectedly satisfying and kinky addition to Hollywood’s superhero chronicles. Touching and odd, laden with genuine twists and grounded by three appealing lead performances, it was ably directed by Peter Berg and written by Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan. It’s a curious movie for the week of July 4, when the air is traditionally filled with the rockets’ red glare and muscular box office heroics. There’s a real jolt in the choking, splenetic exhaust of a disgruntled blockbuster anti-hero, especially one played by the affable Mr. Smith, who 12 years ago this very week helped save the world in “Independence Day,” a movie that made blowing up the White House into a joke.That was then, this is now, and while it would be a stretch to say that this summertime amusement has much on its mind, it does have a little something percolating between its big bangs and gaudy effects. Most of that something isn’t overtly political, despite the setup (Super Angry Black Man), a few winking asides and Mr. Berg’s downbeat tendencies. Mr. Smith may be playing a provocative role in a city famous for its troubled race relations, but he’s also a megastar and largely shielded from everyday stings, which, as it happens, is also true of his character. Hancock kicks back in a couple of derelict trailers (the Shack of Solitude) instead of a mansion, but his pain is existential, not material. He suffers at his leisure.Engineered for broad, knowing laughs, with lots of kablooey, “Hancock” is principally a comedy and for a while plays out that way, notably when Mr. Smith is interacting with Jason Bateman. Their characters meet cute when Hancock saves Ray (Mr. Bateman) from being flattened by a freight train. In typical fashion, Hancock botches the save. He plucks Ray from death, but in the process derails the train and, also true to bad form, receives an invective-laced earful from the gathering mob. Struck by the crowd’s hostility, Ray, a public relations guy with a do-gooder streak and a knockout wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), decides to rescue Hancock in turn by giving him a superhero makeover, one that follows a course blazed by many a fallen star (contrition, redemption, fabulousness).Mr. Berg, who explored heroism of a different stripe in his poignant high school football movie, “Friday Night Lights,” and showed off terrific action chops in the underrated flick “The Kingdom,” is not a comedy natural. He squeezes laughs out of “Hancock”  —  Mr. Bateman needs no goosing  —  though some of its biggest yuks are fairly yucky, like a cringing bit involving a bizarre variant on prison rape. (That’s entertainment?) For the most part, what Mr. Berg does is bring gravity to “Hancock,” a heaviness that can feel lugubrious even in midair though it often seems just right for a lonely, walking-if-usually-flying, seemingly self-loathing question mark. Mr. Berg takes the character’s complications to heart, and Mr. Smith, his charm and smile dimmed, does the same.The extent of that complexity doesn’t emerge until the big reveal, which involves Ms. Theron’s character and is so surprising that I heard several grown men loudly gasp. (“No way!”) I was more struck by Ms. Theron, an actress who, I think, is capable of greater depth than most of her performances require, even those that try to rub the glamour off her. She helps Mr. Smith enrich the story’s emotional texture, which is no small thing, since the movie itself starts to falter just when it begins to deepen. That’s too bad because while “Hancock” is far from perfect  —  it feels overly rushed, particularly toward its chaotic end  —  it has a raggedness that speaks honestly to the fundamental human fragility that makes the greatest heroes super.“Hancock” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

It’s the usual impersonal slab, the kind that municipalities have been building for decades to educate, or sometimes just to warehouse, restless young bodies and minds. The girls who congregate at this particular center in Cincinnati, though, have their own desires, which they express with fists and feet, grace and power. They move — fluidly, ferociously and with escalating mystery — to their own transporting beat.The same holds true of “The Fits,” a singular first feature from the young director Anna Rose Holmer, who’s made a movie that can feel like a memory. The story — Ms. Holmer wrote the script with one of the movie’s producers, Lisa Kjerulff, and its editor, Saela Davis — is elemental, elliptical and radiates out from its sun, the 11-year-old Toni (the wonderful Royalty Hightower). One of those quiet, watchful girls (either naturally shy or tactically stoic), Toni all but lives at the recreational center, specifically the boxing club where she works out with her older brother, Jermaine (Da’Sean Minor), throwing punches and counting situps as she gasps for her next breath.Toni’s boxing routine derails after she peers through a center window one day and discovers a new world — a dance team called the Lionesses. They’re a gorgeously variegated group, these girls, who come in all sizes, shapes, hues, hairstyles and degrees of coordination. Some fill the room with vertiginous movement, with spinning limbs and whipping hair that turn their practice room into an Abstract Expressionist canvas of slashing, swooping lines. Other girls just get tangled up and collapse like pickup sticks (all flailing, all flopping). Yet even these fumblers keep chasing the group beat, waving their arms while together everyone pumps their hips.Curious, Toni joins the Lionesses (what’s the worst that can happen?, her brother shrugs); it isn’t a fast fit. Trained in the boxing club, she jabs more easily than she turns, but she’s strong; another new recruit, Beezy (Alexis Neblett, a charmer), calls her “Guns,” a nod to her muscled arms. But Toni keeps at it, awkwardly miming the moves of the older girls while studying their rites, as when she observes two beauties primping before a mirror. In time, she also picks up their language: She pierces her ears, wears nail polish and flashes a smile. The drill that the Lionesses practice is part joyous self-expression, part ritualistic bluff, which makes it a perfect manifestation of adolescence.Ms. Holmer leads with atmosphere and space (including that landscape called the human face), and tends to let the sumptuously textured visuals and intermittent blasts of percussive music express what the characters don’t. (The cinematographer is Paul Yee, another talented newcomer.) Just at the point when the movie seems to be settling into familiar indie-film narrative drift, the older girls begin having inexplicable seizures, fits. One after another, they violently succumb, bodies shuddering and falling in front of their mesmerized team members. The girls are horrified by these spells, but they’re also fascinated maybe especially because the victims soon recover.An outsider is called in to investigate the attacks, and there’s talk of contaminated water. The inquiry adds a hint of drama to the minimalist plot, but is finally irrelevant to the seizures, their enveloping mysteriousness and profound impact on Toni. Are these Freudian fits, “Crucible”-like convulsions, orgiastic reveries, initiation ceremonies (into femininity, etc.) or sly performances from attention-hungry adolescents? If the filmmakers never directly say, it’s because they don’t have to. Gender is some kind of performance (hysterical, hysterically absurd). And anyway Toni figures it out. This is, after all, her story, as the expressionistic cinematography underscores.As Toni shifts between the boxing club (she helps her brother clean up) and the dance team, “The Fits” seems to be inching into perilously schematic ground. There’s something altogether too neat-sounding about a story in which a prepubescent girl overtly coded as a tomboy travels back and forth — with inquisitiveness and periodic unease — between these distinctly gendered spaces. The miracle of the movie is that, like Toni, it transcends blunt, reductive categorization partly because it’s free of political sloganeering, finger wagging and force-fed lessons. Any uplift that you may feel won’t come from having your ideas affirmed, but from something ineluctable – call it art.“The Fits” is not rated, i.e. suitable for all ages.

SCOTT,"Review: ‘The Hitman’s Bodyguard,’ With Samuel L. Jackson","Samuel L. Jackson is the hit man. Ryan Reynolds is the bodyguard. What more do you want me to say? These two sometime residents of different branches of the greater Marvel cosmos — Nick Fury and Deadpool, if you need reminding — join up, with ostentatious reluctance, on a European jaunt, leaving a trail of dead minions and flummoxed law enforcement officers from Manchester to The Hague. Their common nemesis is an Eastern European despot, a genocidal maniac with a scholarly mien and personal touch played, it seems almost redundant to point out, by Gary Oldman.“The Hitman’s Bodyguard,” directed by Patrick Hughes (“The Expendables 3”) and written by Tom O’Connor, is not a good movie, but, in fairness, it doesn’t try to be. It occupies its genre niche — the exuberantly violent Euro-action movie-star-paycheck action comedy — without excessive cynicism or annoying pretension. The stars banter and bicker and wax sentimental about the badass women in their lives (Salma Hayek and Élodie Yung) until the time arrives for the next shootout or car chase or suite of explosions.These range from tedious to wildly overblown to kind of fun. A hot pursuit in and along the canals of Amsterdam — with Mr. Jackson in a speedboat, Mr. Reynolds on a motorbike and the bad guys in black cars — brings a few jolts and gasps, even if the digital seams in the sequence peek out intermittently. A bout of tool-assisted hand-to-hand combat in a hardware store makes up in efficiency for what it lacks in originality. The final blowup and showdown destroy whatever sense of proportion the movie might have had, along with a lot of Dutch infrastructure.Mr. Jackson plays Darius Kincaid, a fearsome contract killer cooperating with the authorities to free his wife (Ms. Hayek) from prison. Mr. Reynolds is Michael Bryce, a formerly “triple-A”-rated security specialist whose career and relationship (with Ms. Yung’s Interpol agent) went south after he lost a client. One of these fellows is an uptight, cautious, detail-oriented professional, while the other has a looser, more improvisational style. No points for guessing which is which, or for predicting who learns what from whom.Darius, despite a résumé piled high with dead and maimed bodies, is more righteous avenger than sociopath. This, too, is no surprise. A least since “Pulp Fiction,” Mr. Jackson has made a specialty of playing murderers touched by a curious sense of moral grace. Mr. Reynolds, for his part, is comfortable and credible as a smart, suave young punk in need of a bit of schooling. Mr. Jackson lays claim to most of the good lines and the big scenes, but no one can complain about that.Michael, however, does object to Darius’s reliance on a certain 12-letter expletive. “You ruined it,” he whines, supplying this otherwise blunt, none-too-clever movie with a morsel of meta-humor. Every movie fan knows that Mr. Jackson didn’t exactly invent that multifaceted word, but in its modern phraseology, he is nonetheless something of a mythic figure.",0,75020039.0,,1

That ridicule is the first of many humiliations and rejections by the opposite sex that Jesse endures in the film, written by Mr. Leguizamo and Kathy DeMarco and directed by Alfredo De Villa.An unwieldy mixture of narrative and stand-up comedy, embellished with clever animation by Bill Plympton, the movie begins on a wrong note with a tedious scene in which the depressed middle-aged Jesse ambles around New York City. When the episodic story finally begins, it follows Jesse from childhood into adulthood.On screen and onstage, Mr. Leguizamo is usually a fast-talking, hyperactive stick of dynamite. And the movie is a fumbled attempt by this ferociously talented comic actor to bridge the gap from eternal adolescent to adulthood in a format vaguely similar to that of an extended episode of “Louie.”It isn’t until Jesse emerges from the shadow of his better-looking older brother that he discovers his mojo as a sex-crazed ladies’ man. At Vassar, where he studies theater, he meets Lara (Radha Mitchell), a Manhattan socialite with whom he falls in love when he sees her sneeze. The sneeze as turn-on becomes an unfunny running gag.He moves on to Zowie (Rosie Perez), a selfish shrew who clings to his coattails as he ascends to fame and fortune in C movies, playing Latino thugs.Mr. Leguizamo, 50, still has charisma, but with his maniacal stage persona barely seen and the themes recycled from earlier projects, “Fugly!” is a dud.",0,,,0

Steve Earle, the country rocker, turns up in a secondary role and acquits himself well. So does Faith Hill, the country star. And one of the leads is played by Riley Keough, granddaughter of Elvis Presley.The story, though, isn’t quite as attention-getting as the casting. It involves Kermit (Chris Zylka), who, after being released from prison, returns home to a run-down part of Mississippi, vowing to stay on the straight and narrow. But — guess what? — that’s harder than it might seem, especially once he falls into a relationship with Rachel (Ms. Keough), whose sick mother has racked up medical bills. The temptation of easy money lures Kermit back to the sketchier side for what he hopes will be just one big payday.This is well-worn territory, and though the two leads are very good, the romance that is supposed to drive the story isn’t particularly well delineated; Kermit and Rachel meet and fall instantly in love, few questions asked. Maybe that’s part of Mr. Bedford’s point — in a world where no one has much, people grab onto whatever they can — but it feels thin. The film is long on atmosphere, short on details.Mr. Bedford, directing his first feature (which he also wrote), cuts brief interviews of real Mississippians into the story. They talk about their hard lives with unadorned honesty. It’s a refreshing flourish that gives the film some of its best moments.",0,,,1

In this movie  there are few teenagers and no rebellion, only bouncy inspirational ditties. “I Miss You,” a wholesome ode to Ms. Cyrus’s dead grandfather, is as doleful as it gets.What you do see are diverting 3-D effects and lots of playing to the camera by Ms. Cyrus, who performs as both herself and as her television alter ego, Hannah Montana.

But it’s equally significant as a pointed act of retelling.The focal point of “Free Angela and All Political Prisoners” — Ms. Davis’s trial for her role in the deadly 1970 Marin County, Calif., courtroom takeover — will not yield left-field revelations to anyone familiar with this era. But Ms. Lynch, who directed a 2004 look at another forceful female black leader in “Chisholm ’72: Unbought and Unbossed,” interviews Ms. Davis and her associates for a vivid portrait of a time.“Free Angela” sketches out its subject’s graduate education in Europe, early support for the Black Panthers and aborted career as an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, before chronicling the trial and dramatic related events, including Ms. Davis’s weeks as a fugitive and 1972 acquittal. The stands taken by many involved lend a stirring idealistic drive to the film. Ms. Lynch rarely fans out from a supportive viewpoint of Ms. Davis’s actions or ideas, though she dwells on Ms. Davis’s passionate letters to the Black Panther and prison inmate George Jackson, whose freedom was the goal of the courtroom takeover.Ms. Davis, today approaching 70, cannot be contained by what is going on around her.

O. SCOTT,An Artist Overlooked in Plain Sight ,"A horror movie tucked inside a domestic drama wrapped up in a biopic, Tim Burton’s “Big Eyes” tells the story of Margaret Keane, an artist whose characteristic style is summed up in the title.Starting in the 1950s, Ms. Keane — who is still alive and who is played by Amy Adams with a whispery Tennessee accent and an air of patient melancholy — painted thousands of pictures of waiflike figures with sad faces and oversized peepers. In the 1960s, she was both famous and almost entirely unknown. Her work was everywhere, devoured by the public and scorned by critics. But fans and detractors alike believed that the author of that work was her husband, Walter, who hogged the spotlight while his wife stayed home with the pigments and the canvases.How this arrangement came about — and how it fell apart — is Mr. Burton’s main concern. Margaret arrives in San Francisco in flight from a bad first marriage, accompanied by her daughter, Jane (Delaney Raye as a young child, Madeleine Arthur as a teenager). The world is an unfriendly place for a single mother, and the city, shot in bright, saturated colors (by Bruno Delbonnel), has a lurid creepiness that suggests Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” an impression underlined by Ms. Adams’s blond, slightly chilly vulnerability.Walter Keane, speaking of creeps, seems at first to be an ebullient, free-spirited charmer. He seems that way to Margaret, anyway. The rest of us, recognizing Christoph Waltz, will suspect other, less amusing dimensions to the character. A Sunday painter who claims to have studied in Paris, Walter, who works in commercial real estate, encourages Margaret’s creativity and offers security for her and Jane, whose father is threatening to sue for custody. The new couple exhibit their work in a nightclub (owned by the great scene-stealer Jon Polito), and when Margaret’s forlorn children attract more attention than Walter’s Parisian street scenes, he starts to claim them as his own.Walter is a mediocre artist — if that — but he does have a genius for self-promotion. Intuiting the Warholian spirit of the times, he pushes the boundary between art and commerce, turning his surname and his wife’s talent into a powerful and ubiquitous brand. He is helped by a gullible newspaper columnist played by Danny Huston. Though “Big Eyes” is entirely on Margaret’s side, especially as her husband’s sadistic, controlling behavior comes to the forefront, it depends on Walter’s manic, devilish energy. Ms. Adams’s performance is sensitive and subtle, but the film can’t quite figure out what to do with her character’s passivity. Trying to do Margaret justice, Mr. Burton can’t prevent himself (and Mr. Waltz) from upstaging her.“Big Eyes,” directed in Mr. Burton’s coy, heavily pictorial manner, and written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, never quite achieves the full measure of psychological intensity promised by the spooky interior lighting, the low camera angles and Danny Elfman’s hysterical score. The element of Margaret’s personality that allowed her to remain under Walter’s spell for so long remains opaque.A more intriguing ambiguity has to do with the value of Margaret’s work. Terence Stamp shows up briefly as John Canaday, a real-life New York Times critic who attacked the selection of a large-scale Keane painting called “Tomorrow Forever” for the 1964 World’s Fair. Canaday (a Kansas native here depicted as an imperious patrician with an ascot and a British accent) exposed Walter Keane’s hucksterism but also trashed Margaret’s art as “the very definition of tasteless hack work.”Is that judgment altered by the knowledge that the paintings, rather than emerging from a self-promoting man’s supposed encounters with orphans in postwar Berlin, sprung from the unconscious of a self-effacing woman? This is not a simple question, and it is one that Mr. Burton toys with to intriguing effect. In his magnificent “Ed Wood,” the director cast a sympathetic eye on a widely reviled filmmaker, exploring the ambition and integrity behind some of the worst movies ever made.In “Big Eyes,” the sincerity of the artist trumps the judgment of the critics, and her vision triumphs over fraudulent promotion. It makes a passionate case for her. Whether it vindicates her art is another question entirely.“Big Eyes” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Volatile temperaments, uncouth language, bad art.",0,8021168.0,14482031.0,1
672,2010-11-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:12,MIKE HALE,Passion at the Piano,"“Regina Spektor: Live in London”  — that’s what it’s called, and that’s what you get. Eighteen songs, performed in December 2009 at the Hammersmith Apollo, with an absolute minimum of onstage chatter and dollops of stylishly grainy, MTV-like filler: Ms. Spektor on the plane from New York, driving through London, applying makeup before the show. It’s perfectly tasteful, a fine showcase for her music and, more important, a fine promotional tool for the accompanying CD and DVD (which  — surprise  —  contain four additional songs).The director, Adria Petty,  frequently returns to a close-up of Ms. Spektor at the piano, shot from a slightly odd angle and in a harsh light. It glamorizes her  — highlighting the pale face framed by waves of red hair (none of her usual curls) and the boxy sleeves of her beautiful, vintage-looking black dress  — at the same time that it puts a distance, a subtle alienation, between her and the viewer. That’s not a bad correlative for Ms. Spektor’s generally lovely songs, whose lyrics often feel anti-confessional: clever and finely observed, but withholding of anything truly personal.At the end of the film she encounters stage-door fans waiting outside the building. We see her smiling and signing autographs, but we don’t see her talk to anyone  — just an over-the-shoulder “bye” as she walks away.“Live in London” is dedicated to Daniel Cho, who is seen playing the cello throughout the film; he drowned in Switzerland in July while on a European tour with Ms. Spektor.REGINA SPEKTORLive in LondonOpens on Friday  in Manhattan.Directed by Adria Petty; photographed by Rick Woollard, Tom Harding and Mike Metcalf; edited by John Gutierrez and Ms. Petty; produced by Sarah Roebuck and East Pleasant Pictures; released by Cinema Purgatorio/Sire/Warner Brothers Records.

SCOTT,The Mob Work Is Tough; Then He Has to Go Home,"Aging stage actors  typically dream of playing King Lear,  but many of their younger screen counterparts these days will settle for nothing less than Jesus. Not literally: the part of the actual New Testament Jesus tends to be a limited role best suited to actors of limited range, like Jim Caviezel (“The Passion of the Christ”) or Jeffrey Hunter (“King of Kings”). But there is something irresistible about modern men of sorrows who sacrifice themselves for the sins of others, and certain movie stars — Kevin Costner and Will Smith, most strikingly — have not hesitated to exercise the Messiah Clause in their contracts.In “Biutiful,” Javier Bardem joins their company, bringing admirable passion  to a gritty story that amounts to a lower-depths, urban version of the Passion. Mr. Bardem, best known to American audiences for his chillingly persuasive embodiment of evil in “No Country for Old Men,” combines muscular, charismatic physicality with an almost delicate sensitivity, and this blend of the rough and the tender gives “Biutiful” a measure of emotional credibility that it may not entirely deserve.Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu,  “Biutiful” takes place in grimy and crowded parts of Barcelona that are a world away from that city’s tourist attractions. Mr. Bardem plays Uxbal, a midlevel underworld figure whose main business is dealing with the black-market labor of illegal immigrants. He checks in on Chinese sweatshop workers and African vendors of counterfeit watches and bags, collecting and dispensing money and running interference with police officers and factory owners.As if that were not stressful enough, Uxbal is also juggling two young children, a mentally unstable former wife (Maricel Álvarez) and a terminal illness. Every day he is faced with choices that test both his resolve and his decency, as he tries to be stoical, tough and compassionate — a good father, a canny hustler and a patient lover in situations that make every role nearly impossible.And the role of Uxbal itself would surely cripple an actor less endowed with gravity and grace. Mr. González Iñárritu, working with the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, a frequent collaborator, but without Guillermo Arriaga, his screenwriting partner on “Babel,” “21 Grams” and “Amores Perros,” demonstrates familiar strengths and weakness. Unlike his previous films, this one, which he wrote with Armando Bo and Nicolás Giacobone, tells a single, relatively linear story, without hectic cross-cutting and chronological displacement.From one scene to the next, as is his custom, Mr. González Iñárritu creates a feeling of raw, sprawling intimacy. The coarse-grained, lyrical naturalism of his shooting style can seem more tactile than visual, and every shot is full of emotional and social detail, bringing Barcelona to itchy, sweaty life. And the faces of its inhabitants (including Mr. Bardem, with lank hair and a heavy brow) are more picturesque than pretty, and their bodies look exposed and raw even when they are fully clothed.Once again, Mr. González Iñárritu’s fine and subtle instincts as a director of actors and a composer of shots are undermined by a melodramatic sense of story and a fundamentally sentimental conception of fate. “Biutiful” certainly looks real, and it rubs your face in all kinds of harsh facts of life, from mental illness to poverty to the fatal effects of cheap space heaters operating in poorly ventilated rooms. But this extreme misery is tethered to an idea of redemption that is disconcertingly soft.Mr. González Iñárritu does not have the stomach for the stringent moral and spiritual vision of authentically (or even experimentally) religious filmmakers like Carl Dreyer, Robert Bresson or the Dardenne brothers. Instead he traffics in a vague theology of uplift, wherein the road to an entirely abstract heaven is paved with noble instincts.The tension between this director’s methods and his intentions — between his exacting, sometimes amazing craft and his resolutely banal ideas — may ultimately be a problem of audience and genre. “Biutiful,” like “Babel,” looks more daring and more difficult than it is. But if Mr. González Iñárritu were, let’s say, to adapt a novel by Nicholas Sparks, whose views on love and morality are not ultimately all that different from his, the result might be a satisfying and surprising synthesis of styles: a feel-bad art film with an uplifting message for everyone. “Biutiful,” come to think of it, is almost that, but not entirely in a good way.“Biutiful” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sex, violence and drug use.BIUTIFULOpens on Wednesday  in New York  and Los Angeles.Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu; written by Mr. González Iñárritu, Armando Bo and Nicolás Giacobone, based on a story by Mr. González Iñárritu; director of photography, Rodrigo Prieto; edited by Stephen Mirrione; music by Gustavo Santaolalla; production design by Brigitte Broch; produced by Mr. González Iñárritu, Jon Kilik and Fernando Bovaira; released by Roadside Attractions.

SCOTT,Review: Robert Redford and Jane Fonda Are Neighbors With Benefits in ‘Our Souls at Night’,"As gentle as a moth’s wing, as soft and sweet as the flesh of a marshmallow, “Our Souls at Night” chronicles the blossoming of a December-December romance between two neighbors in the fictional prairie town of Holt, Colo. It begins not with a spark of passion but with a sensible, if unusual, proposal. Addie Moore shows up at Louis Waters’s house and asks if he will sleep with her. Addie doesn’t mean she wants to have sex with Louis. She wants to slide under the covers next to him, turn off the bedside lamp and chat quietly until slumber arrives, simulating the easy marital intimacy that the two of them, both long widowed, have learned to live without. Louis, startled by the idea, agrees to think about it.He and Addie are solid, respectable people of a kind who usually show up in movies to be mocked or sentimentalized. The disappointments and satisfactions they have lived through are etched on their faces, which are also the faces of two very famous movie stars — Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. Viewers with long memories or heavy TCM habits will recall that 50 years ago they starred as New York newlyweds in “Barefoot in the Park.” In 1979, they reunited, with a touch more denim, in “The Electric Horseman.” The intervening decades have hardly diminished their charm or their skill, and part of the pleasure of this film, directed by Ritesh Batra (“The Lunchbox”), lies in the rediscovery of what wonderful actors they can be, and how good they are together.“Our Souls at Night,” adapted (by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) from Kent Haruf’s final, posthumously published novel, is too cautious and cozy to be a great movie, or even a very interesting one. The music (by Elliot Goldenthal) telegraphs the emotions too precisely, and Mr. Haruf’s wry and subtle plot is mishandled, so that there is both too much dramatic conflict and not quite enough. When Addie and Louis’s grown-up children show up — played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Judy Greer — they drag in some bulky baggage. Each family has a painful event in its past, and each child represents a textbook drawing of the consequences of that pain, rather than a fully embodied, credibly suffering human being.Luckily, the stars have humanity to spare, and very little left to prove. With her careful diction and a bearing that conveys starchiness and sensuality in perfect, improbable balance, Ms. Fonda turns middle-class maturity into a bewitching form of charisma. Addie’s approach to Louis, a man she has never known that well, is driven less by neediness than by a rational understanding of what she needs. She needs to be less alone.Louis, for his part, doesn’t mind his solitude. Mr. Redford, who barely uttered a word in “All Is Lost,” at first seems prepared to match that feat here, interrupting what seem like monthlong pauses to mutter, sigh and occasionally deliver a complete sentence. He is one of the great minimalists of American cinema, an actor who can dazzle you by opening the tiniest window onto a character’s inner life. When Louis meets Addie’s young grandson, Jamie (the remarkable Iain Armitage, seen on television in “Big Little Lies” and “Young Sheldon”), the encounter awakens a long-dormant paternal instinct, and also a streak of boyishness.Addie’s companionship awakens other urges, but “Our Souls at Night” is in no hurry to confirm the hunches of the audience or the suspicions of the town’s nosier citizens. (One of these, a blowhard friend of Louis’s, is played by Bruce Dern, who once upon a time was Tom Buchanan to Mr. Redford’s Jay Gatsby). Since Addie and Louis are already sleeping together, there’s no need to rush into anything.",0,,,0

His son, Vikram (the heavy-lidded Pakistani heartthrob Fawad Afzal Khan), a shrewd businessman, is not only engaged to a woman of his economic station but is also monitored by his imperious, upper-crust mother (Ratna Pathak Shah). The brash, often clumsy Mili, in her mixed-pattern ensembles, descends on their estate like a tornado, bumping into statuary, dancing with the servants and winning hearts, especially Vikram’s.Anne Hathaway made a splash in Disney’s “The Princess Diaries,” and the rangy Ms. Kapoor (who descends from a Bollywood dynasty) shares some of her early incandescence, along with a Julia Roberts-like smile. (Mr. Khan wisely underplays against her supernova, never trying to eclipse her.)Bollywood films have appropriated Hollywood genres and imagery for years, but Mr. Ghosh, using a pleasing pastel palette, deftly achieves a particularly Disney-like polish. And he avoids making-of-a-royal pitfalls: Ms. Kapoor’s character never abandons her humor for refinement. Twice, Mili says that she was raised to speak up for herself.

Vrooooom! Flex ’Em if You Got ’Em,"At one point during the preordained throwdown between the two colossi who stride through “Fast Five,” Dwayne Johnson rips off his bulletproof vest with the practiced economy of a 17th-century courtesan flinging off her corset. His character, a professional tough guy bluntly named Hobbs, has just found his fugitive bad twin, Dom, the gnomic guru of the “Fast and Furious” franchise, played by Vin Diesel. They are the fast and, yes, the furious. Yet as these giants grasp each other’s bulging muscles, their bald heads rearing in the frame with tumescent vigor, it’s easy to imagine that they’d like some alone time.They don’t get it, largely because the earth might spin off its axis if they did, though also because the director Justin Lin, having come of cinematic age in the maximalist era of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, cleaves to the principle of more. About the only silence you hear in this movie, amid the crunch of metal and the hard rain of shattering glass, is the one between Dom’s ears. Given that he’s been molded along the bulbous lines of Sly and Arnold, but with a hip-hop backbeat, this makes sense. Words, after all, are tricky, undependable things, and Dom communicates just fine with glares (darting, lingering, burning) and gears (fast, faster, fastest). When he zoom-zooms, everyone listens.“Fast Five” is the fifth installment in this surprisingly durable, often absurdly entertaining series, though the fourth chronologically. I didn’t notice or care about the disjointed time frame, what with all the distracting noise on screen. In a free-for-all like this, where the laws of gravity and dictates of narrative logic are left to eat dust, it doesn’t matter when anything takes place or why. Here things happen — like two racing cars pulling, with choreographed precision, an enormous safe through Rio de Janeiro without killing the entire populace — because the filmmakers make it so. Characters, like franchises, can even rise from the dead, as with Han (Sung Kang), who checked out in the previous movie, “Tokyo Drift.” In genre filmmaking it’s all about the eternal return.Han’s seeming resurrection allows him to reunite with Dom and much of the old crew, including Brian (Paul Walker, wooden), a former cop and street-racing fiend who’s in love with Dom’s sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster, leaden). Shortly after the movie opens, these well-matched empty vessels are making goo-goo eyes at each other on a Brazilian train, a lull before the over-the-top robbery that sparks the combustible action. Mr. Lin, a smart tease, waits before showing Mr. Diesel in all his hypertrophied glory. Dom enters as a cubistic enigma — a hammy hand manhandling a gear shift, a bulky outline in long shot — before bursting into full view in a nimbus of white light, a cross slung around his neck to announce his status as the franchise redeemer.He doesn’t save it alone, having help from Tyrese Gibson and the moonlighting musicians Chris Bridges (a k a Ludacris), Tego Calderón and Don Omar. On the little ladies’ side a former Miss Israel, Gal Gadot, mostly mounts and dismounts a motorcycle, though she also points her bony, bikinied hips toward the story’s ogling heavy, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). The Spanish actress Elsa Pataky, as a Brazilian cop, mainly bats her lovely lashes at Dom. All these types are in play because Dom wants to rip off Reyes, though the big steal here is from the “Ocean’s Eleven” series, innocuous pilfering that helps put meat on what had become an emaciated run of flicks. Mr. Johnson, trying his best to look serious, is the gravy.Manufactured for extreme wows and not a single thought, “Fast Five” is an exemplar of industrial moviemaking calculation, one that combines demographic savvy with revving engines, grunting men, crashing cars and promenading female bumpers that are made for looking but not touching, partly to maintain the child-friendly PG-13 rating, partly to keep the men and action moving relentlessly forward. In between the increasingly over-the-top action scenes that turn Rio into another demolition derby for visiting Americans, the writer Chris Morgan tosses in a little God talk and some manly jabber about family (along with some self-aware laughs), if not enough to provoke even the young and the restless to start texting.

You’ll know just how he feels. However inadvertently, those are the most relatable moments in this movie, and the closest its makers come to connecting with whoever’s still watching.Directed by Xavier Manrique from a script by Nicholas Schutt, the tale centers on Fenton (Shiloh Fernandez), a writer returning home to his parents (Mary-Louise Parker and Chris Noth) in Manhattan after a self-imposed exile on the West Coast. A fictional story he once wrote for The New Yorker, ostensibly about his girlfriend at the time, Jessie (Ashley Benson), and her family, wasn’t veiled enough, and they were greatly embarrassed.In the year or so since Fenton slunk away, Jessie met a new beau whom she is about to marry. By moping around her a few times and boozing a little, Fenton apparently seeks to win her back.It’s often an uphill battle for films about fiction writers — cerebral sorts who practice a static profession — and too frequently we see Fenton merely sitting and gazing at his open laptop, cursor blinking on a blank page. The premise here is already implausible: The days when a short piece of literary fiction could devastate a wide social circle are very likely gone. Worse yet, the stakes are always low for these high-income characters.Nobody seems to get genuinely sad or elated or — pick any emotion — in “Chronically Metropolitan,” making it tough for a viewer to do the same. One longs to praise Mr. Manrique for attempting a serious-minded story in this, his first feature. But there needs to be a real reason to embrace it, rather than what’s on this screen.",0,,,1
678,2010-04-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:11,MIKE HALE,"A Fight Against Bigotry and Violence, Lasting 45 Years and 8 ½ Hours","When documenting racist atrocities, one proven tactic is to go long, matching the gravity of your subject with sheer duration. Joining “Shoah” (about 9 hours) and “Eyes on the Prize” (14 hours) in this category is “Have You Heard From Johannesburg,” Connie Field’s seven-film, eight-and-a-half-hour documentary series about apartheid.The history of the subjugation of South Africa’s nonwhites and of their long battle against their white rulers — a struggle frequently undermined, until near the end, by the governments of the United States, Britain and France — certainly deserves the time. And “Have You Heard” (the title comes from the lyrics of the Gil Scott-Heron song “Johannesburg”) presents a vast amount of information that will be new to most American viewers, especially in its early sections.Setting education aside, however, it’s a tricky business evaluating these documentaries from a cinematic standpoint. Judged as a whole — that is, watched from beginning to end — they don’t really justify their lengthy claim on our attention. There are repetitions large and small. Many images of police brutality and everyday indignities recur from film to film; more egregiously, the 90-minute fifth and sixth parts, which cover the same period from slightly different angles, feel redundant.Ms. Field (“The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter”) might argue that there’s nothing wrong with that. She conceived the project as a set of self-contained documentaries (originally there were to be just three) that could be seen independently, with no requirement that the viewer watch the entire series. Therefore it shouldn’t matter if there’s significant overlap between a film about economic sanctions and university divestment and one about corporate divestment.But whether or not you  plan to watch the whole series — and why wouldn’t you, if you want to learn about apartheid? — the fact is that the two easily could have been combined into a single film that would have been better at half the length. “Have You Heard” would have benefited from judicious editing throughout: you get the feeling that Ms. Field had trouble choosing among so many eloquent witnesses, so many horrific pieces of old footage.Film Forum in Manhattan is presenting the series in three separate programs of roughly two and three-quarters to three hours each. Program 1, consisting of three hourlong films, is best. It proceeds chronologically from the institution of apartheid in 1948 through the Sharpeville massacre, the jailing of Nelson Mandela and other African National Congress leaders, Oliver Tambo’s establishment of the A.N.C. in exile, the Soweto uprising, the murder of the activist Steve Biko and the passage of the United Nations arms embargo in 1977.Heroes are identified, larger-than-life figures now little known to a general American audience: Mr. Tambo; Mr. Biko; the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme; the Anglican priest Trevor Huddleston; the Mata Hari of the anti-apartheid movement, Conny Braam. There are villains as well, some of them still making excuses for apartheid and complaining to Ms. Field’s cameras of how they were misunderstood.Archival film provides a steady drumbeat of humiliation, horrible violence and transfixing bigotry. A white man on the street looks into a camera and says, “They’ve only just come down from the trees.”Programs 2 and 3 take the story away from South Africa, recounting the various international campaigns against apartheid — the sports boycotts; the fight within the United States, particularly during the Reagan administration, for economic sanctions; and the corporate divestment campaign. The films here, in addition to covering similar ground, also feel less urgent, farther from the action. The events they depict were essential to the overthrow of apartheid, but after a while the crowds of white people marching through the streets or running onto rugby pitches start to blur together.The seventh film, “Free at Last,” closes Program 3 by returning to South Africa for the end game, when escalating violence and economic isolation finally led to the release of Mr. Mandela and the end of apartheid.The use of the title “Free at Last” cries out for a comparison with “Eyes on the Prize,” so here it is. “Have You Heard” gets points for passion and immediacy, in contrast to the somewhat stately “Eyes on the Prize,” but it loses them for its messiness; its literalist impulse to illustrate every point, often with random images not directly connected to the story; and its occasional cheesy luridness. Gunshots are used as transitions between scenes and replace the sounds of the hits and kicks in a rugby match.Even at the level of average-to-mediocre television, though, “Have You Heard” tells an amazing story. If you don’t know it, or you want reminding, the clumsy storytelling can be endured.HAVE YOU HEARD FROM JOHANNESBURGOpens on Wednesday  in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Connie Field; narration written by Jon Else; directors of photography, Tom Hurwitz and David Forbes; series edited by Gregory Scharpen, with additional editing by Ken Schneider and Dawn Lodgson; music by Marco D’Abbrosio and Todd Boekelheide; released by Clarity Films.

Instead she’s a publicist at a hospital who spends most of the film contemplating whether to hop into bed with one of the doctors.For two-thirds of the movie, the filmmakers show a restraint rare in the movie-with-a-Message genre, so much so that the two most appealing characters are those nudging Caleb toward Christianity (Mr. Malcom and Ken Bevel as a fellow firefighter).The story may be a bit gimmicky — yes, there are dramatic firefighter rescues that have little to do with the main plot — and the central couple is thinly drawn. It’s never clear what attracted these two to each other in the first place, and the hard-edged Catherine’s inevitable coming-around hinges, disappointingly, on some simplistic sensitive-male displays. (He does the dishes!)But the cast of mostly amateurs (Mr. Cameron of “Growing Pains” being the exception) is surprisingly good. And the moments of comic relief are mildly amusing.Only at the end do the filmmakers get heavy-handed, and they seem not to know when to wrap up, letting the movie run on for several smarmy scenes beyond its natural endpoint. Until then, though, this is a decent attempt to combine faith and storytelling that will certainly register with its target audience.And maybe with other folks as well: among those caring-for-marriage tips are some that anyone could use to improve any type of relationship, with or without the God part.“Fireproof” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested), mostly for some tantrums by Caleb.FIREPROOFOpened on Friday nationwide.Directed by Alex Kendrick; written by Alex Kendrick and Stephen Kendrick; director of photography, Bob Scott; edited by Bill Ebel; produced by Michael Catt, Tracy Goode, Jim McBride, David Nixon and Brad Weston; released by Samuel Goldwyn Films.

680,2013-03-22,Spring Breakers,"James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson",USA,Harmony Korine,"Crime, Drama",English,63.0,94.0,Harmony Korine,2012,5.3,122731.0,68.0,2017-11-02 04:18:16,MANOHLA DARGIS,Debauchery and the American Experience (Woo-Hoo!),"Just before the candy-colored apocalypse comes to Harmony Korine’s “Spring Breakers” you hear the peaceable murmurings of a beach, of lapping water, calling gulls and playing children. They’re nice, these sounds of summer, promises of carefree, youthful pursuits like building sand castles and shrieking at waves. The first image of what looks like a beach party keeps the happy vibe going. Dozens, hundreds of gyrating, dancing young women and men are basking in the honeyed light — as the beat goes on and the smiles sour into sneers — though it becomes evident that they’re also marinating in a tsunami of beer.The beer doesn’t flow, it floods: over heads, writhing torsos and the bared breasts that wiggle like puppies and wag at the camera like the middle fingers that more and more revelers raise. Welcome to the party, dude, Mr. Korine seems to be saying (or is he snickering?), now sit back, relax and enjoy the show. He proves an excellent ringmaster and a crafty one too. In “Spring Breakers” he bores into a contested, deeply American topic — the pursuit of happiness taken to nihilistic extremes — but turns his exploration into such a gonzo, outrageously funny party that it takes a while to appreciate that this is more of a horror film than a comedy. If the laughter at times catches in your throat, well, that’s part of the queasy, transfixing experience that is “Spring Breakers,” which plays with some of the same ideas in Mr. Korine’s last feature, “Trash Humpers.” In that movie, shot on VHS tape, four characters in rubber masks run amok, getting down and dirty as they compulsively, even ritualistically grind their pelvises against anything — garbage, of course, included — in a creepy, joyless yet also amusing burlesque. In “Spring Breakers” Mr. Korine has traded in his plug-uglies for a far more seductive and commercially viable female quartet that includes two former Disney teen queens, Selena Gomez (as Faith) and Vanessa Hudgens (Candy), along with Ashley Benson (Brit) and his wife, Rachel Korine (Cotty).Introduced shortly after the opening bacchanal, the four play students at a nondescript school somewhere warm that’s ornamented with palm trees and bored young people smoking weed, hanging out, sometimes reading and even attending classes. Over a number of dreamy, elliptical scenes that slide from day to night and back, it emerges that the four friends want to go on spring break but don’t have enough cash. While Faith prays on her problems — “Are you crazy for Jesus?” her church leader calls out — the other three opt for a more direct approach: armed with squirt guns and a lady-sized sledgehammer, they go full-on gangsta and rob a restaurant. “Pretend it’s a video game,” one giggles. “Act like it’s a movie.” So they do.There are consequences of a kind, but first: paaarty! The four later take off for spring break in St. Petersburg, Fla. There they join an invading army that has seemingly commandeered every inch of sand, surf and hotel. From rooms and halls these tanned, groomed, white-teethed paragons of American youth and orthodontics spill onto balconies and into pools, laughing and yelling as they drink, snort, dance, grind, thrash and jump jump jump up, moving together like a single pulsing organism. They’re beautiful and monstrous, enthralling and repellent. For those who don’t belong to their tribe (never wanted to, never did), they may be exotic, worrisome, frightening or representatives of the decline of the West in hot-pink bikinis. Just kids or children of the damned? Take your pick. Mr. Korine, a pasticheur and cultural vulgarian (part Dada, part European art cinema, part MTV’s “Jackass”), isn’t interested in making up your mind for you. Instead he tosses out his ideas like puzzle pieces and lets you see how or if they fit. The women want to go on spring break and want to have fun, and he seems to want the same. He splashes on the gorgeous, gaudy color and bends the story line, adding brief flash-forwards and flashbacks that make it seem as if time were incessantly skipping forward and backward, almost swirling. Gestures, bits of dialogue and moody moments are repeated like old songs, like dreams, rituals and highlight reels. Mr. Korine clearly digs frolicking with his visiting celebrities, and the actresses seem happy to do things that would make Uncle Walt spin in his grave. They’re almost giddy, at least at first, and given that both Ms. Gomez and Ms. Hudgens have put in time working for Disney it’s no wonder that they cut loose. In “Spring Breakers” they have the chance to simulate the behavior that feeds the tabloids without the humiliations and career-crushing price paid by the likes of Lindsay Lohan. For his recent, putatively adult role in “The Paperboy” Zac Efron (Ms. Hudgens’s co-star in Disney’s “High School Musical” series) played a scene in which Nicole Kidman urinated on him. The female stars of “Spring Breakers” get to shoot guns and hang out with James Franco.The fantastic Mr. Franco, wearing grillz and long cornrows, rolls up with guns and a white Camaro convertible with red rims. His character, a rapper from “St. Pete” called Alien, is a hustler, dealer and self-anointed gangsta. He walks the bad-boy walk and talks the talk, but he’s strictly thug lite, a white caricature in a cartoonish masquerade of black masculinity. For the women he becomes something of a sleazy Prince Charming — not all the princesses are equally charmed — in a story that has metamorphosed into a feverish fairy tale. “Look at all my” stuff, he boasts, almost self-amazed, in a startling, deliriously funny riff on “The Great Gatsby” — except that instead of throwing shirts in the air he’s brandishing machine guns, bricks of dope, wads of cash, animal-print shorts.Alien’s masquerade as well as his feud with a black gangster bring the film back to an earlier scene that indicates Mr. Korine has more on his mind than surface shocks. Brit and Candy are sitting in a class in which a professor is murmuring words like Reconstruction, war and African-Americans. One of them draws a heart and the words “I want penis” on some paper. They laugh and, as the professor keeps talking, one pantomimes giving oral sex. It doesn’t matter that they’re not paying attention to their history lesson. Because, at that point, they haven’t yet pretended to be gangstas and robbed the restaurant, giggling as they held a squirt gun to a black man’s head — playing thugs without the burden, without the history, without the cost.Mr. Korine originally shows the robbery from the exterior and through the restaurant’s windows so that the assault, the women’s movements and violence, are seen inside a frame as if you were watching a film within a film. The whole episode looks preposterous, like a bad music video, and the women in their black ski masks just seem silly. Much later, when Mr. Korine loops back to the crime, he takes you inside so you can see the terrified customers cowering as Brit and Candy smash up the place, waving their “weapons.” The squirt guns are fakes, but both the women’s pleasure and the rage that pumps through the scene and increasingly through the film — feeding the excesses, the posturing and escalating violence like a poisoned river — feel eerily real, familiar and very American.At once blunt and oblique, “Spring Breakers” looks different depending on how you hold it up to the light. From one angle it comes across as a savage social commentary that skitters from one idea to another — white faces, black masks, celebrity, the American dream, the limits of self-interest, the search for an authentic self — without stitching those ideas together. From another it comes off as the apotheosis of the excesses it so spectacularly displays. That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out, but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold. Mr. Korine, on the other hand, embraces the role of court jester, the fool whose transgressive laughter carries corrosive truth. He laughs, you howl.“Spring Breakers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun violence and enough naked breasts to supply material for a second Seth MacFarlane song.",1,13900000.0,14124286.0,0
681,2016-07-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:24,ANDY WEBSTER,Review: ‘Don’t Worry Baby’ and a Case of Uncertain Paternity,"The primary focus in the light comedy-drama “Don’t Worry Baby” — the promising feature debut of the writer-director Julian Branciforte — may be its millennial actors, but it’s the older players who bring the weight. Robert (John Magaro) is a hangdog Manhattan photographer flailing after initial success; now he endures the indignity of working for his philandering father, Harry (Christopher McDonald), who runs an Upper East Side preschool.When a girl, Mason (Rainn Williams), is enrolled there, Robert and Harry discover that they both know her mother, Sara Beth (a wide-eyed Dreama Walker), a budding fashion designer back in New York after an extended hiatus in Tennessee. Father and son each had a sexual encounter with her around the same time years ago, and the identity of Mason’s father is uncertain. While they await paternity-test results, Robert, Harry and Sarah Beth — and Harry’s estranged wife, Miriam (Talia Balsam) — have much to talk about.Britt Lower, as an aspiring actress eyeing Robert, is a hovering romantic presence, while Tom Lipinski, as Robert’s ne’er-do-well roommate, a financier with an appetite for pot and porn films, lends humor. The young Ms. Williams, fortunately, is not overused for her adorability; rather, her character is presented as an avenue to maturity. Ms. Walker’s role, though, is somewhat of a cipher.Despite an implausible ending devoid of consequence, “Don’t Worry Baby” benefits from tidy editing, cinematography and, most of all, the presence of the seasoned Mr. McDonald and Ms. Balsam. Their nuanced authority — and the vibrant Manhattan backdrop — make the trip worthwhile.",0,,,1

There’s another appalling sound here, too, created by the collision of corporate avarice — in the blurred form of the National Football League — and a doctor fighting a righteous fight.In the hands of a filmmaker like Michael Mann, who took on Big Tobacco in his 1999 thriller, “The Insider,” the clash between industry and humanity would be front and center and very loud. But while “Concussion” has some fine things going for it, notably science and Will Smith, it lacks the exciting, committed filmmaking that rises to the level of its outrageous topic.In familiar Hollywood fashion, “Concussion” sells a complex issue through an attractive, upstanding Everyman turned hero. A real-world underdog, Bennet Omalu is the Nigerian-American pathologist who, while working in the Allegheny County coroner’s office in 2002, performed an autopsy on Mike Webster, a former Pittsburgh Steelers center. Mr. Webster had endured a strange, disturbing slide into the abyss — he had taken to using Super Glue on his rotting teeth and to stunning himself into unconsciousness with a Taser gun to relieve his back pain — that ended when he suddenly dropped dead at 50. Puzzled by this hall of famer’s troubling behavior and the seemingly inexplicable cause of his death, Dr. Omalu began studying Mr. Webster’s brain, probing its mysteries for a possible answer.What Dr. Omalu discovered were splotches called tau proteins and a progressive degenerative brain disease. (Misshapen tau proteins are also associated with Alzheimer’s disease.) As Jeanne Marie Laskas explains in a sympathetic, no-nonsense 2009 GQ profile of Dr. Omalu, a buildup of tau proteins had done a horrific number on Mr. Webster’s brain. “Tau was kind of like sludge, clogging up the works, killing cells in regions responsible for mood, emotions” and executive functioning, as Ms. Laskas puts it. “This is why Mike Webster was crazy.” Dr. Omalu diagnosed Mr. Webster with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., three letters that have — through scientific studies, news reports and lawsuits — become inextricably connected with three others: N.F.L.“Concussion” charts the diagnosis Dr. Omalu made and the ensuing fight both to force the N.F.L. to publicly acknowledge the truth of his findings and to do something to prevent C.T.E. It also gives Dr. Omalu a blandly tasteful Hollywood makeover. Working from Ms. Laskas’s magazine profile, the writer-director Peter Landesman takes the doctor’s discovery and turns it into a hero’s journey with Bennet forced to trudge past some awfully familiar professional and personal signposts. While some of these milestone moments add detail and shading — namely any scene involving Albert Brooks, who periodically drops by to goose the movie to life as Bennet’s boss — others are too off-the-shelf generic to be of use, including those with Bennet’s eventual wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw).Mr. Smith doesn’t look anything like the man he plays (and is roughly a decade older than Dr. Omalu was when he discovered C.T.E.), but he does what every great screen star can do, which is keep you watching despite the material he’s working with. Playing with a lilting accent and a narrow range of thoughtful expressions — searching, noble, outraged, wounded — he mounts a quietly effective charm offensive that’s the performance equivalent of a bloodless coup. Surrender is easy; welcome too. The gravitational force of Mr. Smith’s persona as well as the periodic moist signal that a good man is being driven to tears are especially crucial because the movie’s version of Dr. Omalu turns out to be too pleasant, honorable and seamlessly perfect to generate any tension.The greater problem is that the movie never gives Bennet a persuasive antagonist, someone — something — that’s substantive enough for him to push against to create the necessary narrative sparks. Instead, his fight is often waged within his own psyche (he doubts, he prays), against proxies like a sniping morgue co-worker (a fine Mike O’Malley) or merely suggested, as with a mysterious car that glides through like a threat. The N.F.L., meanwhile, remains a vague, largely anonymous presence, represented in one unintentionally comic scene by a gathering of unsmiling, corporate crypt keepers, and later by its new commissioner, Roger Goodell (Luke Wilson, in a flattering bit of casting). Every so often cheering football fans pop into the picture, but they too remain strategically off the hook.“Concussion” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Football.

The moment is wickedly humorous  and suggests a movie that’s unwilling to take itself too seriously. If only.The latest Japanese knockoff to fetishize death by technology, Eric Valette’s reworking of Takashi Miike’s  “Chakushin Ari” is a poker-faced puzzle whose biggest shock is the absence of Sarah Michelle Gellar. Subbing for that remake regular is Shannyn Sossamon as Beth, a dour psychology student whose friends suffer grisly deaths after receiving heads-ups  on their cellphones. These wireless warnings, each heralded by an eerie ring tone and disquieting visions, persist even after battery removal — as if the medium’s viral ubiquity weren’t already sinister enough.A brow-furrowing blend of child abuse and adult trauma, Andrew Klavan’s screenplay sacrifices coherence for atmosphere at every turn. As Beth tries to evade her own telegraphed demise — accompanied by a fantastically irrelevant police detective (Ed Burns) — the movie crawls with furry millipedes and creepy china dolls.

Notable only for the involvement of the genre pillar Wes Craven (who died last year and is credited as an executive producer), this sad slasher is as lacking in scares as in ideas.Triteness may be the point, however, in a screenplay (by the director, Nick Simon, and two others) so clogged with clichés that their combined whole must surely be intended as greater than their sum. This hope is fortified by an opening quotation from William S. Burroughs that hints at more highfalutin goals than gouting blood, so we expectantly endure the bland company of Colleen (Claudia Lee), a grocery store worker in South Dakota and the recipient of disturbing photographs of bloodily violated women.The small-town police (led by a slumming Mitch Pileggi) are uninterested, but an obnoxiously foul-mouthed photographer (Kal Penn) is intrigued, arriving from Los Angeles with a posse of vacuous models and plans to mimic the mystery shots for his portfolio. At the same time, two masked killers — the standard psycho-numbskull pairing — are feeding cat food to their latest captive before closing in on Colleen.Cheap-looking and poorly acted, “Girl” has a hackneyed sleaziness that’s not limited to the barely clothed pudenda adorning the end credits. What starts out as a promising commentary on the objectifying nature of photography soon sinks into another rote massacre. The filmmakers, like the photographer, seem mobilized by the belief that an overload of banality is itself a kind of novelty. Not this time.

It’s hard not to grin at his huge sculpture, placed outside a stock exchange, of a raised middle finger, or to be awed by his 2011 retrospective, which hung from a truss atop the Guggenheim’s rotunda.When the experts arrive, the fun stalls. There’s blather about artists as brands, and attempts to study Mr. Cattelan’s past. Opposing voices or opinions from museumgoers are scarce, while professional assessments are neither novel enough to challenge the art enthusiast nor clear enough to engage the newcomer.Still, the art is the star and Ms. Axelrod features plenty of it. She also outlines a knowing path through Mr. Cattelan’s career, leaving just enough room to have you wondering if the artist is more of a con man than a genius. On that, make your own decision.

Rocky has to get in shape if he wants to ascend the stairs of victory again, so the trainer recommends that they employ “good old-fashioned blunt force trauma” and “start building some hurtin’ bombs!” The spookily pale and pretty underage killing machine in “Hanna” played by Saoirse Ronan, then 16, doesn’t have a couple of bombs that hurt: she has a veritable nuclear arsenal of pain at her quick, kinetic disposal.In most fight stories there’s usually a scene or two in which the hero, and sometimes heroine, prepares for battle. In silence or to pounding beats, the combatants train and practice as the camera all but licks their flexing muscles and rivulets of sweat. In these ritualistic preambles, they ready for their fights in much the same fashion, whether they’re called Achilles or Buffy, Secretariat or Hanna: their bodies are transformed into the first field of war. Part of what makes “Hanna” weird and entertaining as well as food if not nourishment for thought, is that the body looks so young: Not 12, but not 16, either, which adds an outré touch to the sight of Hanna taking down a deer and soon after, a human being.“Hanna,” energetically and at times hyperactively directed by Joe Wright, is about a girl raised not by wolves but the next best thing: a bearded and muscled Eric Bana draped in animal skins. He’s the resident mystery man, Erik, a warrior of some type who for initially unknown reasons lives with his daughter, Hanna, in rugged isolation in northern Finland. She’s the bigger puzzle. When the movie opens Hanna is tracking a deer through the snow, running fast, then faster with a quiver and bow. “I just missed your heart,” she tells the deer after downing it with an arrow. She then takes a gun from beneath her crazy-quilt furs and shoots it dead, putting an end to its misery and setting the plot in strange motion.It gets self-consciously odder, agreeably and divertingly so. The screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr is itself a patchwork of action-movie themes — including storm-trooping soldiers in black helicopters and an intelligence agency with a covert program — that have been recombined along Grimm Brothers story lines. And so, after the once upon a Finland time, Hanna and Erik part ways, embarking on an intrigue involving a C.I.A. operative named Marissa Wiegler and played with witty menace by Cate Blanchett. She isn’t the fairest in the land, but she seems the maddest and like the queen in “Snow White” sets her huntsmen (two skinheads and their requisite mincing boss) on Hanna, who pursues Marissa in turn. Round and round they go and where they stop, well, you probably know.In familiar stories getting there is all or much of the fun. To those action-movie ends, Mr. Wright keeps the narrative in overdrive — the gangbuster opening sets the bar almost too high — even as he makes room for quieter times, as when Hanna meets a clan of nondwarfs. This friendly brood (Olivia Williams plays the hippy, not dippy mom), which Hanna meets in Morocco during an abrupt trip to the desert, envelop her in warmth, showing her what family happiness looks like. (She seems to have been on an emotional starvation diet.) The scenes with the family are inviting and a touch eccentric, especially in the almost invasive close-up shots of Hanna’s downy face when she kisses another girl (Jessica Barden).Mr. Wright has a pair of period movies on his résumé, “Pride & Prejudice” and the overstuffed “Atonement.” He can be a wild overshooter. He polishes his images to a high gloss, an unfortunate choice for the World War II killing fields in “Atonement” and the skid row in “The Soloist,” another of his films. No matter his cinematographer (in this case, Alwin Küchler), Mr. Wright likes to toss the camera around like a coked-up cheerleader or a director who wants you to remember that it’s all about him. He doesn’t bring much personality to his work or have an obvious signature, save for a penchant for roving cameras and his appreciation of Ms. Ronan, one difference being that in this movie his cinematographic restlessness works for the story.In the end there might not be much to this tale other than titillation, but there’s plenty to be said for Ms. Ronan, who was the best thing about “Atonement” and holds her ground against forceful screen presences like Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Bana. Ms. Ronan is an otherworldly beauty with a gift for stillness and has alabaster skin that, depending on how it’s lighted, can look creamily alive or morbidly white. In “Hanna” she enters with a face nearly as blank as paper and devoid of obvious emotion, her eerie, translucent blue eyes here transformed into opaque pools.You assume or really just hope that those eyes will reveal exciting new depths or a secret of character. That they don’t reveal much is part of the big surprise as well as a liability in a movie that is by turns startling and generic, subtle and blunt, and consistently keeps you in its grip if not its heart.“Hanna” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

That’s the tone of “Kid Cannabis,” a rollicking tale of border-running teenage pot entrepreneurs based on the real-life story of Nate Norman.Jonathan Daniel Brown plays Nate, a schlubby Idaho lad who organizes his pals into a squadron that brings high-grade marijuana down from Canada, hauling it through the unguarded woods while wearing ridiculous camouflage gear. Although the story is not without its serious aspects, including a homicide, John Stockwell, the director, keeps things carefree as he explores the rise and eventual fall of the smuggling crew, a rags-to-riches-to- ruin saga that leaves most other teenage fantasies looking pretty anemic.The youthful cast is pretty good and receives a delightful boost from two veteran actors, Ron Perlman as a kingpin who bankrolls the boys, and John C.

Sure, John Ford made Monument Valley, in Utah, an indispensable co-star for John Wayne. But Nicolas Roeg, in 1971, made the Australian outback almost sentient in “Walkabout.” With “Bal” (“Honey”), the Turkish director Semih Kaplanoglu enables the lush mountain forests of Rize Province, near the Black Sea, to express what its young protagonist cannot.Yusuf (Bora Altas), an elementary-school student, struggles with a stammer; oral readings in class are such an ordeal that he remains indoors at recess. An overheard passage of Rimbaud read aloud in a classroom gives him a glimmer of the poetic eloquence he can aspire to.He is far more comfortable while watching his adored father, Yakup (Erdal Besikcioglu), a beekeeper, at work, despite the peril involved: the honey Yusup cultivates requires the suspension of hives from tree branches at dangerous heights. Now the bees are dying out, threatened by encroaching pollution, and Yusup must seek better terrain far away. When he doesn’t return from such a mission, Yusuf’s mother, Zehra (Tulin Ozen), her child in tow, embarks on a journey to find him.Soon we discover what is also at stake: a way of life, captured in stunning images. Farmhouse interiors are still-life compositions of exquisite contrast; women harvesting in a field evoke a Millet tableau. And the forests throb with animus, blanketed in an enchanted fog. They beckon to Yusuf, who enters, guided by his father’s companion hawk.Winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 2010 and Turkey’s entry for best foreign-language film at the Oscars this year, the semi-autobiographical “Bal” is the third in a trilogy about Yusuf. It has no musical soundtrack (and barely any dialogue), only a quiet, unforced, organic rhythm. And those spellbinding images.

SCOTT,"From a Clan That Lives by Its Own Rules, a Tale Made for the Movies","The unruly extended family at the heart of “The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia” might have been the subject of an earnest, hand-wringing social-problem documentary. Or else an entire season of “Cops,” since the Whites’ propensity for violence, drug use and general cussedness makes plenty of work for the authorities in Boone County, W.Va.Various well-spoken local lawyers and policemen face the camera to express disapproval and offer sociological interpretations of this clan’s wild behavior. But “The Wild and Wonderful Whites,” directed by Julien Nitzberg, is not principally about Appalachian poverty or highland folkways or the economic legacy of coal mining, even though it touches on all of those matters. Its governing spirit, captured in the raucous music that punctuates the story (including songs performed live by Hank Williams III), is one of outlaw celebration. “Fuss and fight and party” is more or less that family’s motto — though it has more profane variations — and Mr. Nitzberg, in documenting the party, invites the audience to join right in.Not that it’s all fun and games. There is an undercurrent of desperate fatalism in the Whites’ way of life, and also the omnipresent threat of deadly violence. The family patriarch, an accomplished mountain dancer known as D. Ray, was murdered on his way to a performance, a fate shared by several of his children. His son Jesco inherited D. Ray’s nimble feet, and the family celebrity. “Dancing Outlaw,” a 1991 television documentary about Jesco (on which Mr. Nitzberg was an associate producer), made him something of a legend and the subject of several country-and-western songs.“The Wild and Wonderful Whites,” a sequel of sorts to “Dancing Outlaw,” spends a year with Jesco and his mother, sisters, nieces, nephews and other friends and relations, following them into and out of prisons, hospitals, rehab centers and a good many nights of drinking, pot-smoking and prescription drug abuse. A side trip is made to Minnesota, where Poney White, Jesco’s only surviving brother, has escaped with his children into middle-class normalcy, making his living as a house painter and expressing relief to be far from Boone County.Back there, an anthology of country standards unfolds in real life and real time: murder ballads, cheating songs and rebel hollers, with an occasional pause for fatalistic spiritual meditation. The Whites — in particular the three generations of women who are the movie’s most compelling and complicated characters — are not shy in front of the camera, and their forthrightness quiets, at least temporarily, the queasy sense of exploitation that hangs around the film.It is hard to know just what to think of these people, whose unabashed recklessness might make you envious even as you shake your head in appalled amazement at their disregard for every conceivable societal norm. But one thing is certain, and is in a way the whole point of this fascinating and problematic documentary: The Whites don’t care what you or anyone else thinks of them.THE WILD AND WONDERFUL WHITES OF WEST VIRGINIAOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Directed by Julien Nitzberg; directors of photography, David Bird, Dominic Giordano and Michael Kenneth Sydenstricker II; edited by Ben Daughtrey; music by Deke Dickerson; produced by Storm Taylor and Mr. Nitzberg; released by Tribeca Film.

The cabbies have interesting and poignant things to say about being left behind in China’s rush to modernize, and Ms. Wang; her directors of photography, Ian Vollmer and Sean Price Williams; and her editor, Sikay Tang, have produced an attractive and seamless set of images of working-class Chinese life. (The chronology gets a little herky-jerky, with major changes in the drivers’ lives happening entirely off screen.)The film works quite well as a melancholy travelogue — an elevated version of something you might see on cable television — but its aspirations for depth of feeling or more profound social commentary aren’t quite realized. We learn a fair bit about the taxi drivers’ lives without really being drawn into them, and the film’s observations on Chinese society and its modern history are elegantly framed but are nothing you haven’t seen already, possibly in upscale travel magazines.You suspect that Ms. Wang wanted to fit in everything she was seeing:  forced relocations,  the health system,  Olympics propaganda,  paunchy foreign men dancing with young Chinese women, and on and on. Her best material involves a headstrong female driver in her mid-30s, Wei Caixia, who is young by Western standards but close to being over the hill in Beijing. When she shows her wedding pictures to a group of women in their 20s, their disbelief and casual rudeness — “Not as pretty as the old days” — says more than any number of shots of Beijing streets and landmarks flowing by.Beijing TaxiOpens on Friday in Brooklyn.Directed by Miao Wang; directors of photography, Ian Vollmer and Sean Price Williams; edited by Sikay Tang; music by Stephen Ulrich and Itamar Ziegler; produced by Ms. Wang and Ivana Stolkiner; released by Three Waters.

In a movie that deliberately blurs the line between fiction and reality, present and past, the sane and the crazy, interviews with actual mental patients (one of whom claims to have killed John Lennon on orders from the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov) are interspersed with actors playing residents speaking Chekhov’s dialogue.One new patient is the hospital’s former chief of staff Dr. Andrey Ragin (Vladimir Ilyin), a stocky, sad-eyed man with a resemblance to Archie Bunker, who huddles under a bathrobe in the men’s dormitory and refuses to speak. The movie, after introducing various characters and relating the history of the institution, a former monastery and later a tuberculosis sanitarium, settles down to tell the story of Ragin’s downfall.“Ward No. 6,” the Russian submission for this year’s foreign-language Academy Award, has a disorienting sense of time. Although set in 2007-8, the movie, which has a scene in contemporary Moscow with traffic jams and naked dancing girls, features Chekhov’s dialogue from the story published in 1892, conjuring a slower-paced late-19th-century life with endless room for philosophic rumination. The juxtaposition seems to imply that below the frantic pace of modern Russian life, the same longing for “the old days” expressed by many of Chekhov’s characters still applies. When Ragin visits Moscow he disdains it as a city of crooks and stays in his hotel room.The quasi-documentary affectations of “Ward No. 6,” directed by Karen Shakhnazarov with Alexander Gornovsky from a screenplay by Alexander Borodyansky and Mr. Shakhnazarov, also include home movies of Ragin filmed by his best friend, Mikhail (Alexander Pankratov-Chyorny). There is no attempt to reconcile the two tones of the film, shown as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s series Celebrating Chekhov: The Drama of Everyday Life.Ragin’s metamorphosis from slovenly, alcoholic doctor and avid bookworm to inmate kept under lock and key (and in one scene tethered to his bed) is hastened by his friendship with Gromov (Alexey Vertkov), a gaunt, brilliant young patient suffering from persecution mania whom Ragin believes to be a prophet. The two engage in intense, lively debates about everything from belief in an afterlife to Ragin’s certainty of the ultimate meaninglessness of life and death. In their most devastating conversation, Gromov, who has had a much harder life than Ragin, accuses the doctor of being spineless and lazy for indulging himself in “the sphere of nonsense.”“You don’t have to do anything,” Gromov sneers, “and you think yourself a sage.”Ragin, an intellectual snob who laments that Gromov is the only person in this shabby, dirty little town with whom he can have a literate conversation, agrees with that contemptuous assessment. And the movie conveys an uneasy sense that Gromov’s personal demolition of Ragin’s notion of himself as a font of wisdom and enlightenment contributed to the depression that increasingly engulfs him.The modern touches don’t obscure Chekhov’s profound compassion for the human condition and his distrust in science and technology to end human suffering and to erase our awareness of the imminence of death and extinction of all memory. The nihilistic long view of Ragin, whose family insisted he become a doctor instead of a cleric, is bearable for him until he is locked up and cast out of society.“It only took a bit of rough treatment to make me lose heart and cave in,” he observes. “We’re a rotten feeble lot.”",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Ride Along 2’ Reloads Twin Barrels of Ice Cube and Kevin Hart,"“Ride Along 2,” it may not surprise you to learn, is a lot like “Ride Along,” only less so. The buddy-cop action-comedy is a foolproof genre, though it’s also one that requires a fool. This franchise is lucky to have Kevin Hart in that role, and his manic comic energy is enough to make the sequel something other than a complete waste of time. But the genre is also stubbornly innovation-proof, and there’s not much new to see here.Mr. Hart, as an eager Atlanta rookie officer named Ben Barber, is again paired with Ice Cube, who plays James Payton, a veteran detective. Neither man makes the slightest gesture against type. Ice Cube glowers, Mr. Hart jabbers, and a plot is cooked up to provide them with occasions to do so, ideally in the company of women in bikinis or fast-moving vehicles. Plenty of both are to be found in Miami, where a drug kingpin (Benjamin Bratt) has infiltrated the local power structure.Mr. Bratt moves through his hackneyed role with resigned good humor. Olivia Munn, serving as third wheel and ostensible romantic interest for Ice Cube, seems a bit more tentative. Ken Jeong, as a nutty nerd mixed up in some bad business, does what he can to make Mr. Hart look calm and dignified. Except, that is, when he makes Mr. Hart eat discarded nachos out of a garbage can.That is not one of the movie’s funny parts, but there are a few. Several involve Mr. Hart and Sherri Shepherd, who plays the wedding planner organizing Ben’s nuptials to James’s sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter). Their brief scenes together represent a missed opportunity, and may also remind viewers of “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” the brilliant BET sitcom that finds more laughter in touchy issues of race and masculinity than the two “Ride Along” movies (both directed by Tim Story) put together.But that may be an unfair standard. Movies these days are where comedians are paid to play it safe. In half-hour weekly installments — or in a weekend binge — Ice Cube and Mr. Hart might have more room to explore their comic chemistry rather than just cashing in on it.“Ride Along 2” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gunplay and profanity. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes.",0,,90862685.0,0

From across the sea comes a ship, with a couple of friendly-seeming green pigs at its helm. They carry an initially secret stash of more green pigs, a diverting and entertaining lot that is eagerly embraced in bird land. Red, however, believes that his fellow nonfliers haven’t figured out what’s going on, and he turns out to be right.I shall not wax too indignant over the fact that this ostensible children’s entertainment, in this summer of all summers, could easily be taken as an anti-immigration fable. Instead, I shall note that once past its pleasant echoes of cartoon classics like “Birds Anonymous” and “Cured Duck” (a great showcase for the original angry bird, name of Donald), the movie, directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis, settles into the current default mode of animation humor. That is, a DreamWorks-inflected, pop-culture “savvy,” far-side-of-smarm (not too) smart-aleckness, replete with bodily function jokes. The kids of today deserve better. So do I, come to think of it.GLENN KENNY“The Angry Birds Movie” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for gas, urine, mucus and coy innuendo.",0,107506776.0,107483144.0,0

Nobody Knows,"“The awful thing about life is this: Everyone has their reasons.” That perceptive and frustrating quotation (from the 1939 film “The Rules of the Game”) came to mind often during “Indian Point,” a low-key look at a high-tension topic.This documentary, directed by Ivy Meeropol, focuses on the nuclear power plant of the title, which is about 45 miles from Midtown Manhattan. New Yorkers have voiced concerns over the plant’s safety for decades. In the face of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, their complaints have grown louder.Ms. Meeropol tours the plant, interviews workers there and speaks with activists who are petitioning the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to deny the plant relicensing. We also hear from Gregory B. Jaczko, a former commission chairman, and from environmentalists. By and large, all parties seem reasonable and competent.Ms. Meeropol is steadfast in providing both sides of the story. That’s admirable, yet it can come across as uninvolving. No major executives from Entergy, the plant’s owner, are tracked down and questioned; worst-case scenarios aren’t outlined; opinions are rarely challenged. Information from both sides is simply presented without investigation. In one scene, widely disparate claims on how much electricity the plant provides to the region are shown from two sources, with no attempt to verify either.In the end, “Indian Point” is a good overview of the issues, with insights into the problems of regulating the industry. (Footage shown from Japan is particularly frightening.) Yet it’s tough to shake the feeling that a stronger stand should have been taken, either for the plant and its benefits, or against it and its risks. Sure, everyone has reasons. But that doesn’t mean that everyone’s reasons are right.",0,7251.0,,1
696,2017-10-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-20 17:44:02,GLENN KENNY,Review: A Case of Déjà Vu in ‘Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween’,"About a year ago, Tyler Perry’s “Boo! A Madea Halloween” arrived in theaters. It was hardly distinguished, but it had its moments, largely because of the comic interactions between the outrageous, finely aged characters Madea and Joe (both played by Mr. Perry) and their fellow dyspeptic senior citizens, Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis).“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” which, as usual with Mr. Perry’s pictures, wasn’t screened in advance for critics, frequently feels more like a remake than a sequel. The movie revisits Brian Simmons (Mr. Perry), a single dad, and his rebellious teenage daughter, Tiffany (Diamond White). The respect-your-parents and don’t-even-think-about-having-sex lessons of the previous film have long been forgotten by the characters; if anything, Tiffany, now turning 18, is snottier, and Brian more passive. (The movie introduces an ex-wife, played by Taja V. Simpson, who walks all over him and is too permissive with Tiffany.)Once again Tiffany is determined to attend a frat party. And, yes, it’s the same inhabited-by-30-year-olds frat from the first film. The twist this time is the fellas aren’t allowed to have a party in the house, so instead they’re having it at Derrick Lake, which was (cue scary music) the scene of a still-apparently-shrouded-in-mystery (with this shoddy script it’s hard to really tell) mass murder back in the 1970s. Rumor has it some kind of massacre-seeking entity haunts the premises.The prospect of Mr. Perry’s rambunctious Madea possibly taking on a Jason Voorhees-type killer has an amusement value that is not even vaguely realized here. This movie finds Mr. Perry, never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking, drastically off whatever his best game is. Every camera setup is a study in inertia; every other cut is a beat or two behind where a punch line needs to land. To call this movie unwatchable would be inaccurate, though the scenes featuring Mike Tornabene and Yousef Erakat, portraying frat brothers who act as if they are dying to reassemble a group of Dead End Kids for Sidney Kingsley’s play, are pretty painful. On the other hand, the lighting is so weak, “Boo 2!” is quite often close to unseeable.",0,,,0
697,2015-02-20,Still Alice,"Julianne Moore, Kate Bosworth, Shane McRae, Hunter Parrish","USA, UK, France","Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland",Drama,English,72.0,101.0,"Richard Glatzer (written for the screen by), Wash Westmoreland (written for the screen by), Lisa Genova (novel)",2014,7.5,112059.0,87.0,2017-11-02 04:18:20,A. O. SCOTT,Losing Her Bearings in Familiar Places,"“Still Alice” is a movie that addresses a nightmarish circumstance with calm, compassionate sensitivity. Based on Lisa Genova’s novel and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, it follows the deterioration of a Columbia linguistics professor who learns she has early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Alice Howland (Julianne Moore), along with her husband and three children, must endure a cruel and absurd ordeal that has no real chance of growing easier. With what seems like shocking rapidity — the film’s chronology is appropriately fuzzy — Alice slides from a witty, intelligent, capable adult into a fragile and confused shadow of her former self. The title suggests otherwise, of course, and one of the tragedies of Alzheimer’s for the friends and family of the afflicted person is that the sufferer seems present and absent at the same time. “Still Alice” examines both the philosophical and emotional aspects of this paradoxical situation, and the principal vehicle for the inquiry is Ms. Moore’s exquisitely nuanced performance. From the early scenes, when brief memory lapses signal that something is wrong, through the subsequent deterioration of her cognitive ability, she conveys both the collapse of Alice’s inner world and the panic it causes. The structure of her face seems to change from scene to scene, as her eyes grow duller, her mouth and jaw slacker. As she did in “Safe,” she finds a way to communicate the pathos of emptiness.But the film as a whole functions mainly as a scaffolding for this remarkable feat of acting, and also for Kristen Stewart’s excellent work as Alice’s younger daughter, Lydia. The success of the “Twilight” movies has allowed Ms. Stewart’s gifts to be underrated, but her more recent roles (here, in “ Camp X-Ray” and in “Clouds of Sils Maria,” which will open next year) should help re-establish her as an insightful and unpredictable talent. There are tensions at the beginning between Lydia and her mother — in an early scene, Alice picks apart her daughter’s life choices with relentless, passive-aggressive skill — but Lydia is also frequently the only member of the family brave or honest enough to accept who her mother becomes and to find ways of staying connected to her.It’s not that the others fail, exactly. Alice’s husband, John (Alec Baldwin), a research physician, works hard to be tender and supportive, as do the other children, played by Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish. The problem is that the film, concentrating on the accurate portrayal of Alice’s condition, leaves the other characters undeveloped, and their social and domestic milieu hastily sketched. The test of realism in a movie like this — the thing that would separate it from a conventional, made-for-television disease melodrama — is whether you can imagine lives for the secondary characters when they aren’t on screen. “Still Alice” lacks that kind of thickness. It surrounds Alice and her family with the signifiers of a perfect, privileged life: impressive jobs, well-raised children, a Manhattan brownstone and a lovely beach house, neither one too showy. But all of this feels like a too tidy garden that has been planted for the sole purpose of introducing a blight and observing its ravages. The story is sad and sincerely told, but it is too removed from life to carry the full measure of pain that Alice deserves.“Still Alice” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Strong language and sexual allusions, as well an incurable disease.",0,,10049000.0,0
698,2013-09-27,Don Jon,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza",USA,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",English,66.0,90.0,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,2013,6.6,211822.0,79.0,2017-11-02 04:18:17,MANOHLA DARGIS,"So Full of Himself, Yet Running on Empty","Once upon a time “Don Jon” had the unhappy title “Don Jon’s Addiction.” That was in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where the movie had its premiere. But addiction, which conjures up drunks, druggies and roads to recovery taken 12 steps at a time, felt at odds with the skittering, upbeat cadences and feel of “Don Jon,” an often exuberant movie about a man hooked on pornography who can’t deal with the breathing, desiring women who end up in his bed. So now the title just suggests Don Juan, the fictional Spanish libertine whose womanizing ways lead to — depending on who tells or sings the tale — comic and tragic fates, including a descent into hell and an ascent into redemptive love. And while addiction may make Jon sound like a bummer, as played with great swagger and subterranean wit by the movie’s writer and director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this improbable charmer conveys convincingly triumphant braggadocio. That’s true even if all Jon cares about, as he repeatedly claims in a voice-over that sounds like a loop, are ‘“my body, my pad, my ride, my family, my church, my boys, my girls, my porn.” That’s a whole lot of me and mine.Which is directly to the point of this deceptively sincere movie about masculinity and its discontents that Mr. Gordon-Levitt, making a fine feature directing debut, shapes into a story about a young man’s moral education. That schooling begins the night that Jon, a New Jersey bartender and a regular at a club throbbing with beats and bodies, first sees Barbara Sugarman (a superb Scarlett Johansson), who’s setting the room ablaze in a scorching red dress. After he and his friends, the diminutive sounding Bobby and Danny (Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke) debate her beauty using their usual crude methodology — Jon deems her a dime, or a 10 — he makes his well-practiced move. What he fails to grasp is that the moment he locks eyes with Barbara, he’s no longer the hunter but the prey.Barbara has her own addiction, specifically to the kind of storybook romance that, the movie suggests, reduces human relations to commercial transactions as much as pornography does. Mr. Gordon-Levitt has fun with this idea (and with cameos from Anne Hathaway and Channing Tatum) without fully developing it. “Don Jon” takes women seriously, but like a lot of contemporary American movies, including many romantic comedies, it’s mostly interested in what it means to be a feeling, thinking man in a world in which many of the old certainties have disappeared. Each time Jon sits down to a family dinner — his mother (Glenne Headly) bustling in the kitchen as his father (Tony Danza) waits at the table — the comedy feels almost ethnographic, as if you were watching a soon-to-be-extinct tribe.At times, Mr. Gordon-Levitt almost smothers his intelligent movie in jokes, as with the repeated references to Jon’s pad, his ride, his girls and boys, all of which register fairly soon as markers or even trophies of an obsessively cultivated narcissism. With his pumped physique and shellacked hair, his tight pants and hard jaw, Jon is as much a walking, talking cartoon as the representations he onanistically worships, so it’s fitting that the movie opens with an actual animation. It’s the first in a flurry of equally cartoonish images, now of real women, which flash across the screen and, as the pace of the editing accelerates, turn into a flurry of pneumatic breasts, bulbous buttocks and cavernous mouths. It’s a kind of dismemberment by montage, although here it’s finally Jon who’s in pieces. To a degree, “Don Jon” echoes an idea that the film theorist Linda Williams advances toward the end of “Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the ‘Frenzy of the Visible,’ ” her revolutionary feminist study of pornographic films and their contradictions. “Pornography as a genre wants to be about sex,” Ms. Williams writes. “On close inspection, however, it always proves to be more about gender.” Mr. Gordon-Levitt effectively translates that thesis into funny, eventually touching and dramatic terms in his movie, which shifts registers when Jon meets an almost ghostly older woman, Esther (a tender, true Julianne Moore). After presenting him with a 1970s Danish pornographic film directed by a woman, Esther offers Jon something more valuable and, just maybe, deliverance.“Don Jon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Unlike the hardscrabble characters in his new movie, Mr. Kwak is from a family of doctors. He abandoned medical school to study film at New York University, and both his style and themes seem indebted to New York-based films by his fellow alumnus Martin Scorsese and by Francis Ford Coppola.As “The Godfather: Part II” reached back in time to offer a fuller picture of its family, so too does Mr. Kwak’s sequel. It jumps among decades at a dizzying pace. Beginning with the sentencing of the antihero Lee Joon-seok (Yoo Oh-seong) for ordering the death of his friend, the film takes place primarily after his release, as he tries to revive the gang founded by his father. The emotional core of the story, though, is his father-son relationship with a violent delinquent named Seong-hoon (Kim Woo-bin).In addition to the copious flashbacks, there is an overly generous heaping of styles on display. It can be jarring when a flatly lit comic scene, as bright as a network sitcom, is followed by graphic violence. The tone is most successful when it is the least original: When Mr. Kwak apes the slow-motion, shadows and Catholic choral music familiar from Italian-American mob films, the tension and love between the two leads is effectively conveyed. The subtle anguish of performances by Mr. Yoo and Mr. Kim is a welcome addition to the gangster flick family.",0,,,0

Singleton Jr., Jim Cody Williams",USA,Christopher Munch,Drama,English,66.0,104.0,Christopher Munch,2011,6.3,119.0,86.0,2017-11-02 04:18:14,MANOHLA DARGIS,"In the Deep Forest, an Unusual Bond and Untamed Beauty","In his poem “The Way West, Underground,” from his collection “Turtle Island,” Gary Snyder writes vividly of “The split-cedar/smoked salmon/cloudy days of Oregon,/ the thick fir forests.” The book’s title refers to an indigenous creation story in which North America emerged from some soil placed on the back of a turtle by a woman who fell from the sky. In some versions of the story a muskrat helps her. The woman in Christopher Munch’s lovely, delightfully idiosyncratic “Letters From the Big Man,” resplendent with its own dense forests and cloudy Oregon days, has already fallen to earth and is looking for a way back up or maybe just forward. She gets help from a sasquatch.That would be the Big Man (Isaac C. Singleton Jr., fantastically kitted out in fur and makeup), one of the more eccentric characters recently to hit the Big Screen. By virtue of his mythological status (um, perhaps), the Big Man is decidedly a more unusual movie presence than the woman, Sarah, though she too is unusual. A strong presence strongly played by Lily Rabe, Sarah, a former United States Forest Service employee, is the type of independent woman who, in American cinema, has moved off the threatened and onto the endangered list. Through many miles, narrative switchbacks, a drib of politics, a drab of shamanism, she and the Big Man develop a beautiful friendship.The movie opens with Sarah packing up some belongings in an apartment and clearly leaving a man, seen with her in a photo, and a life behind. She tosses what she wants in a truck that she has adorned with primitive decorations, chucks the rest of her stuff and drives out of the city and into the woods. Mr. Munch, whose earlier films include “The Hours and Times,” handles this efficiently. But he doesn’t reveal what a splendid eye he has until he switches to some aerial shots of Sarah driving on a road that winds like a ribbon through a forest, a point of view that suggests that of an eagle — thereby introducing the idea of nonhuman perspectives — and underscores her isolation.She isn’t alone for long, although she seems to ache, at times almost irritably, for solitude. There is a stop at a ranger station, where she borrows a kayak from an old friend, Penny (Fiona Dourif). Leaving her truck and friend behind, Sarah paddles off on a swift river, a sometimes perilous-looking voyage that signals her resolve and athleticism (and recklessness: she isn’t wearing a helmet), and shifts the movie into a sustained pastoral register.What beauty Mr. Munch finds between the sheltering sky and rushing water. As he and his wizardly crew (including the cinematographer Rob Sweeney, expertly working in digital) bring the vibrantly hued landscape, dappled in greens, reds and gold, alive on screen, Sarah becomes just one part of what is clearly a much bigger picture.Sarah ditches the boat and slips into the woods with such visible confidence that it’s apparent that this is where she belongs. (Mr. Munch likes to put Ms. Rabe in short shorts, showing off strong, shapely legs that look as if they could run in an Ironwoman triathlon or snap a man in two.) Now a struggling artist, she is doing field research for her old employer in the wake of a fire. After a quiet interlude her solitude is interrupted by the two male characters who will vie for her attention for the rest of the story: a friendly hiker, Sean (Jason Butler Harner), who turns out to be an environmental activist, and a more rarefied interloper, a sasquatch, an elusive, transformative presence.For a character in a character study, Sarah is something of a puzzle at first, and almost off-putting. When Penny hugs her goodbye, Sarah doesn’t hug back, and when she meets Sean, she shuns the usual niceties and instead asks if he has a weapon, before flashing her gun. (This doesn’t register as Freudian but prudent, especially given the drug gangs who set up shop in forests.) Later, after she leaves the woods, where she sensed a pair of eyes on her — and no wonder, sasquatch is on the watch — and moves into a secluded cabin elsewhere, she assumes a more distinct, ruggedly individualistic figure of the neo-frontierswoman, one who probably read the Transcendentalists in school and now generates her own electricity to run her laptop.In “Walden,” Thoreau writes of a starving, exhausted man lost in the woods whose loneliness is relieved by “grotesque visions” that he takes to be real. The sasquatch in “Letters From the Big Man,” a beguiling, Buddha-like figure who occasionally enjoys a wild-thing tantrum, offers Sarah — starving, the movie suggests, like the rest of us — companionship of a type, as well as a new, moving way of being.As the story unwinds, Mr. Munch piles on the plot, mixing in romance, American Indian mythology, environmental fights and a government conspiracy that would be narratively unsustainable if his generosity toward his characters, his seriousness and faith in his story, didn’t make it all seem perfectly reasonable. And funny: I wish, Sarah muses to the Big Man, I had a man like you. Maybe she does!LETTERS FROM THE BIG MANOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written, produced and directed by Christopher Munch; director of photography, Rob Sweeney; music by Ensemble Galilei; art director, Ricardo Herrera; costumes by Kristen Anacker; released by MBG Art and Film/Antarctic Pictures.

First he has to put up with an angry court spectator who shoots a leering defendant just declared innocent. Then James’s mother dies, and he and his wife, Jennifer (Valerie Azlynn), and 7-year-old son, Danny (William Pifer), move into Mom’s country home, where spectral residents befriend Danny and terrify Jennifer. The local priest (Lance Henriksen) clearly isn’t sharing all he knows, and before long James just isn’t acting like his old self.“Dark Awakening,” directed by the makeup-effects veteran Dean C. Jones, is good for a game of Name That Influence: ghostly playmates (à la “Paranormal Activity 3”), a fallen clergyman (“The Exorcist”), a drenched female apparition crawling toward the camera (“The Ring”) and secrets in the basement (too many to count). But the fun ends there. Overabundant diffuse lighting and wide-angle perspectives only compound this horror movie’s deficiencies in plot and dialogue. A procession of gruesome set pieces toward the end (including child murder and the killing of a cat) offers copious gore but little payoff.Mr. Henriksen (fresh off the horror comedy “Stung”) does what he can, while Ms. Azlynn flails hopelessly against the two-dimensional constraints of her frightened-mother role. As for Mr. Cook, he bravely attacks his part, imparting shifting shades of sinister intent. But all their efforts prove in vain against a movie beyond salvation.",0,,,1

SCOTT,"Review: In &#8216;10.000 km,&#8217; Lovers an Ocean Apart Struggle to Connect","The opening scene of “10.000 km,” which is more than 20 minutes, follows Alex and Sergi through the intimate rituals of a Sunday morning: making love, making breakfast, brushing their teeth, imagining the baby they are thinking about having. They have been a couple for seven years, but their domestic happiness is shadowed by professional frustration. It’s hard for Alex (Natalia Tena), an expatriate British photographer, to make a living in Barcelona, where they live. A lot of their friends have moved away. Sergi (David Verdaguer) is preparing for exams that will give him a full-time teaching license. They seem to be in their late 20s or early 30s, at the still young but not that young stage of life when career paths start to narrow and choices begin to seem newly consequential.Alex is offered a yearlong residency in Los Angeles, 10,000 kilometers from Barcelona, the kind of opportunity that is almost impossible to refuse. She doesn’t want to refuse it, and Sergi doesn’t want her to, and their separation is the subject of Carlos Marques-Marcet’s astute, formally impressive film. The long-distance relationship is not an uncommon phenomenon in contemporary life or, for that matter, in modern movies. A not-bad Hollywood comedy on the subject, “Going the Distance,” starring Drew Barrymore and Justin Long, was released in 2010. Mr. Marques-Marcet is especially interested in the role technology plays in negotiating absence. Video chats create an illusion of immediacy (and the possibility of enhanced phone sex). Social media can bring us closer, but can also sow suspicion. (Who is the untagged person in that picture? Where was the picture taken? Why didn’t she tell me she was going there?) Looking at zoomed-in satellite images of faraway cities can feel like a cheap and easy substitute for being there.As the days stretch into months (the film keeps count as we jump ahead at random intervals), Alex and Sergi discover the limits of these tools. The filmmaker, in contrast, makes ingenious use of them, finding novel ways of placing screens within his carefully composed shots. For a while it seems as if Google, Facebook and Skype must be the sponsors of “10.000 km.” But this isn’t product placement; it’s life as we know it. Those companies are collaborators, makers of images and enablers of feeling.The reality of our dependence on them is both beautiful and dreadful. Mr. Marques-Marcet, who wrote the screenplay with Clara Roquet, is neither a techno-pessimist nor a digital utopian. There are scenes that capture the cruel alienation of screened existence: an especially haunting image shows Alex, a floating head on Sergi’s laptop, watching helplessly as he rages through their formerly shared home in the middle of a fight. But there are other moments when the chance to see the face of a lover an ocean and a continent away feels like a miracle. The director’s discipline is remarkable, and also a bit constricting. His camera splits its time between the velvety shadows of the Barcelona apartment and the spartan whiteness of Alex’s place in Los Angeles. For the viewer, Alex and Sergi exist in isolation. They are literally the only people in the movie, and though Ms. Tena is exceptionally gifted at registering nuances of feeling in close-up, Mr. Verdaguer, much of his face hidden behind a heavy, dark beard, is more of a cipher. Sergi starts out jokey and winds up mopey without showing the full dimensions of his personality.And “10.000 km” itself, like its numerical title, tends toward abstraction. Alex and Sergi are finally less a couple than a problem, a mathematical equation that doesn’t quite balance.“10.000 km” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

When this particular speed demon, Cam (Taylor Lautner), has an accident, he slams into a young woman practicing another kind of perpetual motion, parkour, an equipment-free sport that treats urban spaces as obstacle courses. Corny twists and exchanges ensue in the wobbly story, but, delightfully, Daniel Benmayor’s film shows love not just for stunts but for the dynamic surfaces of the city.Fallen from the peak of the “Twilight” phenomenon, Mr. Lautner is game here for playing a well-meaning joe who’s deep in debt to a Chinese loan shark. Cam tracks down the parkour whiz, Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos), and, after proving himself, joins her in a group of thieves for hire.

704,2015-08-07,Irrational Man,"Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Joe Stapleton, Nancy Carroll",USA,Woody Allen,"Comedy, Drama",English,53.0,95.0,Woody Allen,2015,6.6,47734.0,46.0,2017-11-02 04:18:22,MANOHLA DARGIS,Review: Woody Allen&#8217;s &#8216;Irrational Man&#8217; Explores Life&#8217;s Randomness,"In Woody Allen’s 1987 drama “September,” a writer and a physicist walk into a room (well, really, they’re playing pool) when the writer asks the physicist, “Is there anything more terrifying than the destruction of the world?” The physicist, sunk deep in gloomy shadow, answers, “Yeah, the knowledge that it doesn’t matter one way or the other — that it’s all random, radiating aimlessly out of nothing and eventually vanishing forever.” The physicist says that he’s not talking about the world. “I’m talking about the universe,” adding, “all space, all time, just a temporary convulsion.”The exchange is in keeping with Mr. Allen’s oft-repeated insistence, on-screen and off, that life is meaningless, which may be true even if he seems feverishly bent on refuting it with his prodigious cinematic output. If you’ve seen any of that yield, you have seen a version of “Irrational Man.” As tends to be the case with his work, this new light and dark film looks, sounds and plays a lot like some of his previous titles. That isn’t a dig. One of the givens of Mr. Allen’s screen work and sometimes its attractions is how each new film registers as another chapter in a project that, in its scale and scope, and in the way in which it seems to speak to his personal life, has come to resemble a weird metafiction. In his short story “The Book of Sand,” Jorge Luis Borges creates “an infinite book” without beginning or end, which is another way of describing how it can feel when considering the entirety of Mr. Allen’s films.The faces in those movies change as do their budgets and all the contingent rest — the support staff, locations, costumes and so forth, even as the preoccupations remain much the same. In “Irrational Man,” the usual resident Allen philosopher is an actual philosopher, Abe Lucas, a newly arrived East Coast college professor whom Joaquin Phoenix makes equal parts attraction and repulsion. A soulful presence, Mr. Phoenix excels at playing characters who often struggle to express themselves one tormented or comically inarticulate word at a time. Here, though consistently watchable, he often seems ready to flee the scene, perhaps because his character is so uneasy or because Mr. Allen hasn’t given Mr. Phoenix enough material to turn Abe into a thinker who can persuasively cite Heidegger.Mr. Allen’s habit of not giving his performers much direction means that they sometimes end up fending for themselves, which can create an almost unintentional Brechtian alienation effect as they struggle to get a hold on their characters. At times, Mr. Phoenix doesn’t seem to be grappling; he seems disengaged, as if he — rather than Abe — were estranged from what’s happening around him. That’s especially true in his scenes with Emma Stone, who plays Jill, an eager A student who’s attracted to Abe because that’s how she was written. Much of the time Ms. Stone, who leads with a smile that dims, seems to be trying to coax a reaction out of Mr. Phoenix. That gives the movie an uneasy edge, as does Parker Posey’s turn as Rita, a sexed-up cliché.The story turns on chance and its absence and starts humming when, after eavesdropping on a dramatic conversation in a diner, Abe decides to commit a crime in the name of a greater good. Armed with poison and some spurious reasoning, he does the deed and finds himself rejuvenated creatively, spiritually, sexually: It makes him tumescent. Mr. Allen plays this notion for some weak laughs; better is the powerful close-up of Abe’s face after the crime — his unfocused eyes staring ahead and ringed in violent red — that suggests the frenzied madness of the void. It’s startling and unsettling for what it conveys about Abe and because unlike in “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” in which a rabbi responds to another void by plaintively invoking a “moral structure,” there’s no real argument being advanced here.The thinly written Jill is certainly no match for, or answer to, Abe, who in putting (distorting) some of his philosophical beliefs to criminal ends evokes Leopold and Loeb, 1920s “thrill killers” who misread Nietzsche. The horror of where rationalism can lead (the death camps, for one) hangs over “Irrational Man” and helps hold you as does Mr. Phoenix, even with some bad writing and Mr. Allen’s narrative laxity and lack of interest in how real people live. At one point, he includes a fairground scene, perhaps to evoke Alfred Hitchcock’s “Strangers on a Train” and its mad, murderous theorist. It makes for a nice shiver by proxy in a film that goes dark without going deep and keeps you wondering just how personal the title “Irrational Man” is or if it’s more of an existential shrug.“Irrational Man” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Salinger,"With the glossy “Coming Through the Rye,” the director James Sadwith pays heartfelt tribute to both J. D. Salinger, the reclusive writer of “The Catcher in the Rye,” who died in 2010, and the book itself. He also affectionately fictionalizes his own past (he wrote the script), drawing from his actual meeting in adolescence with Mr. Salinger.It is 1969, and 16-year-old Jamie Schwartz (Alex Wolff) is hopelessly alienated at a boys’ prep school. Tormented by his peers and identifying with Salinger’s hero Holden Caulfield, he has adapted and is determined to mount a stage production of “Rye,” encouraged by a teacher (Adrian Pasdar). But first he must secure Salinger’s blessing. So he sets off, with the aid of a sprightly, sensible townie, DeeDee (Stefania Owen), for the author’s home in New Hampshire. (That state is played by the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, lovingly shot by Eric Hurt.) The journey succeeds, at least as far as a meeting with Salinger, and in terms of cementing Jamie and DeeDee’s intimate bond.Mr. Sadwith — a seasoned television writer, director and producer making his feature debut — adds faint echoes of “Catcher” while lending a polished veneer, most evident in a romantic scene amid swirling milkweed seeds. Mr. Wolff is appealingly earnest (but lacks Caulfield’s caustic edge), while Ms. Owen is a radiant burst of optimism. As Salinger, the formidable Chris Cooper has a brief but masterly turn, sympathetically rendering the writer as a curmudgeon defending his literary offspring. “Go do something of your own,” he tells Jamie. Mr. Sadwith eventually did.“Coming Through the Rye” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and mature themes.",0,4000.0,,0

And there have been movies about surfing (Bruce Brown’s classic “The Endless Summer”; his son Dana Brown’s “Step Into Liquid”). Adam Pesce’s “Splinters” is a bit of both, with less gloss but stronger ethical impact. A real-life examination of competitive surfing in Papua New Guinea, the film derives tension from the proverbial big tournament but also from how the event helps foster a worthy morality.Andy Abel of the Surfing Association of Papua New Guinea encourages villagers in Vanimo to participate in the country’s first National Surfing Titles, whose winners will go to Australia to train with world-class wave riders. Signing up are the proud, aggressive Angelus Lipahi and the earnest, hardworking Ezekiel Afara, both inspired by glossy magazine images of surfing superstars. The married Angelus is accused of fathering and financially neglecting children by a woman who is not his wife; on the eve of the competition, she threatens police action.The sisters Susan and Lesley Umpa also enter the competition, with more at stake. Both are sick of having their surfboards (splinters, in indigenous slang) stolen by local men. The fiercely driven Lesley in particular says she resents the housebound drudgery expected of women and the endemic domestic abuse invariably accompanying it. Not all of these players win in this capable account of their struggles, but all contribute to a valuable lesson in fair play.",0,,,0

Instead, it stuffs an entire encyclopedia of dicey ideas (visual, narrative, political) into a blender to create a wacky, eyeball-popping and -glazing extravaganza that suggests a Cecil B. DeMille Bible epic, a Chinese military parade and a Busby Berkeley musical, at times all at once. And while it can be tough to find the human pulse amid the spectacle noise, Jackie Chan, John Cusack, Adrien Brody and a trillion horse-riding extras are also part of the very big picture.The least interesting question to ask about a movie like “Dragon Blade” is whether it’s any good. Of course it isn’t, not especially, but questions of quality pale next to the greater headscratcher: What is it? For starters, it is a Jackie Chan vehicle, a period story, a Chinese production and a huge 2015 box-office hit in the People’s Republic. (It opened in China in February.) Written and directed by the genre-smashing Daniel Lee, who has epic DeMille-level ambitions, the movie takes place in the first part of the Han dynasty, when the court, supported by its elites, ruled its far-flung empire with military muscle and bureaucratic administration. So the movie, which involves a government squad protecting the Silk Road, may be a resonant, topical metaphor — or not.Whatever it is, it is also about putting on a really big show with your pals, who here include both the fantastically outfitted constituencies of 36 nations who swirl around the Silk Road and a legion of Roman soldiers who materialize on it one day, having apparently taken a wrong turn on the Appian Way. The clotted story involves how these different groups are juggled with a broad smile and some fancy footwork by Huo An (Mr. Chan), the leader of the Silk Road guard. A jolly, friendly warrior with chin fuzz, some swinging Heidi braids and the kind of intricately detailed costume that turns seamstresses blind, Huo insists on giving peace a chance, even when dodging arrows shot by Cold Moon (Lin Peng), one of the few women in what is otherwise an enormous brotherly be-in.Mr. Chan has slowed considerably since his glory action years, even if he still dodges and darts with elastic grace. His character is on the dull side and is mostly a hub for all the swirling parts that Mr. Lee puts into motion. There are many of these, because Mr. Lee, like Michael Bay and other specialists in the art of cinematic mayhem, likes to throw everything at the screen that a monster budget can give him. And, other than women, “Dragon Blade” has a whole lot of everything, including armies of extras, herds of horses, truckloads of feathered-and-furred costumes, bushels of strikingly styled hair, innumerable crane shots and choreographed fights. There’s also a blind Roman boy with a blond mop who sings a nationalist ditty and brings the multitudes to collective tears. There are special effects, too, though none as jaw-slackening as the performances from Mr. Cusack and Mr. Brody. Mr. Cusack plays General Lucius, who has ended up on the Silk Road in an effort to protect Publius (Jozef Liu Waite), the warbling babe, from his older brother, General Tiberius (Mr. Brody). Mr. Brody either took his role seriously or can keep a straight face better than Mr. Cusack, whose contortionist expressions tend to suggest someone desperate not to let loose either laughter or bowels. Mr. Brody, by contrast, takes to his villainous role with old-fashioned Basil Rathbone hauteur, swaggering and twirling while leading with his profile. At one point, Mr. Brody even runs his tongue over his bloody hand, as if to acknowledge just how finger-licking good his role is.“Dragon Blade” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

In the 1930s, runaway brides ran amok with banter and high jinks; in the 1940s, femmes fatales did their men wrong with lipstick sneers and a bullet to the heart. The latest iteration of this type of movie often skews comic and generally involves a group of gal pals getting together for some “we time.” They find trouble and, here’s hoping, their bliss amid oceans of booze and maybe drugs, sometimes in the company of men, who are alternately helpful or hapless.The affably amusing, sometimes spittingly funny comedy “Girls Trip” recycles much of the same naughty women idea used and occasionally abused in movies like “Bad Moms” and “Sisters.” As in the recent “Rough Night,” the women in “Girls Trip” are old college friends who, after going down their respective paths, are reuniting for better and, at times, for worse. In “Rough Night,” the regulation naughtiness ends up with the women, who are mostly white, accidentally (uh-oh) killing a man. That isn’t on the menu for the black women in “Girls Trip,” who, despite being fictional also exist in our world and so presumably would have a much harder time giggling their way out of spilling blood.That makes “Girls Trip” seem tamer than a movie like “Rough Night.” But “Girls Trip” is also funnier; it’s also more appealing because it knows that there’s more at stake existentially for women, and especially for black women, than out-grossing men. The friends in “Girls Trip” have other issues to work on, all of which are grounded in ordinary life: how to live in the world with love and joy, how to nurture intimate relationships so they don’t slip away, how to balance professional and personal obligations without going nuts, how to perform fairly tricky sexual acts without embarrassing you or your partner right out of bed — you know, the usual.An invitation brings the friends and story in “Girls Trip” together. It’s sent by Ryan (Regina Hall), an entrepreneurial self-help guru who is rapidly heading toward Oprah-level celebrity. With a megawatt smile, an affirmation for every occasion and a beautiful husband by her side (a thankless role, capably handled by Mike Colter), Ryan seems to have it all. She’s turned her life into a brand by selling other women on the idea that they can have it all, too, but now she’s not so sure. After being tapped to speak at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, she invites three friends along for a weekend of sharing, caring and boozing, topped with guest turns from the likes of Common and Sean Combs.Enjoyment turns out to be contagious in “Girls Trip,” which consistently manages to rework and even reinvigorate some severely worn-out conceits, setups and character types, mostly by complicating gender roles with class issues. The struggler is Sasha (Queen Latifah), a former serious journalist turned flailing gossip blogger; the wallflower, Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), is a nurse and single mom; the cutup, Dina (Tiffany Haddish), well, it’s unclear what she does. She works, kind of, in an office or did — even her boss seems baffled about her status — but mostly Dina is the crazy snake in the can, the whoopee in the cushion and the movie’s biggest, rowdiest laugh generator.The director Malcolm D. Lee (“The Best Man”) helps turn these types into characters efficiently and sympathetically — he knows how to light and frame a beautiful face — though every so often you sense he would like to cut loose visually. Mostly, he serves Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver’s script, which goes high, low and sincere as it mixes some slapstick in with the sober bits, giddily indulges its freewheeling silliness and drops heart-to-hearts ranging from a sharply comic lesson on white privilege to a hilarious riff on the joys of grapefruit sex. (Ms. Oliver and Mr. Barris, who created the sitcom “black-ish,” also wrote “Barbershop: The Next Cut,” which Mr. Lee directed.)Like most movies of this comic ilk, including the male-centric “Hangover” types, “Girls Trip” is effectively a narrative striptease. Characters — mostly ordinary, straight, middle-class types — take some of it off, the “it” being the cultural and social norms that define and often restrict them: the veneer of respectability, the accommodating smiles, the regulation control. At times this involves female characters testing, gingerly if fleetingly, the limits of that construct called femininity. “Girls Trip” adds complexity to the picture by bringing in class, even as it dispatches with whiteness, showing it the door so that these women can find themselves while rediscovering the power and pleasures of sisterhood.",0,115088305.0,115108515.0,1

Almost a decade has passed since the endlessly mutating T-Virus began transforming most of humanity (and zoology) into drooling, pimply cannibals, but Alice — part human, part viral, all airbrushed — is still fighting to save the world. She must be as tired as we are.Not wearying at all of Ms. Jovovich’s eternally moving parts, the director, Paul W. S. Anderson (who wrote all five installments and has directed three), this time strips his leading lady of her superpowers and, by way of consolation, reunites her with previously terminated characters. (Whether you’ve been sushi’d by a laser or blown up by an atom bomb, Mr. Anderson will find a way to resurrect you, usually with even fewer facial expressions than before.)He also supplies Alice with a daughter — cribbing shamelessly from “Aliens” — and an alternate suburban reality that ends abruptly when zombie hordes invade her laundry room. Just try explaining that to Sears.Taking place almost entirely inside computer-simulated global locations, “Retribution” moves closer than ever to its airless video game roots. Ms. Jovovich may possess a limited acting vocabulary, but her body has a language all its own. Perhaps we should say bodies: once again, we have multiple Alices, all in dire need of new wardrobes.

O. SCOTT,Dad’s at Another Museum. Does That Make Him an Exhibitionist?,"The paradox of “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian” is that a movie so bursting with novelty can feel so utterly familiar. This is partly because it’s a sequel, of course, but even the first “Night at the Museum,” directed, as this one is, by Shawn Levy, was a mixture of old hat and cool new stuff.That may just be the formula for pleasant, innocuous and intermittently thrilling family entertainment. Keep the emotions safe, simple and knowable, and focus the younger audience’s attention on a magic show of cute, funny, zany creatures and characters while throwing some half-clever verbal humor at the older kids and the accompanying parents. Apply a touch of prestige, on loan from widely admired educational and cultural institutions and voilà. You can’t lose.Where Ben Stiller fits in all of this remains a bit of a puzzle, but here he is again, a virtuoso of hostility playing the lead in a warm and fuzzy family comedy.Mr. Stiller is Larry Daley, whose learning of an important life lesson (as in the first installment), frames the nocturnal shenanigans that are the movie’s reason for being. In “Night at the Museum” he was a drifting divorced dad who needed to reconnect with his son and learn to follow his dreams. Now, having followed them to unlikely success as an inventor and late-night infomercial star, he must again reconnect with his very patient son (Jake Cherry) and also learn to stop following his dreams, or follow different ones, or something.Whatever. Mr. Stiller’s two best scenes involve his sparring with the always welcome Jonah Hill and being slapped around by a couple of monkeys. Otherwise he’s on hand to be a grinning, bossy, anxious foil for the various historical figures and artworks that spring magically to life when the sun goes down. Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan are back as Jedediah and Octavius, two miniature warriors from different epochs (one cowboy, one Roman), and Robin Williams takes another turn as Teddy Roosevelt. There are some bobble-headed Einsteins, a giant marble Abraham Lincoln (who steps down off his memorial to knock a few heads together), Gen. George Custer (Bill Hader) and a smattering of classic paintings, sculptures and photographs.The conjuring of all these artifacts — many of them really on display in various parts of Smithsonian —  is delightful and often ingenious. Whether the movie pays irreverent homage to cultural treasures or trivializes them for fun and profit is an interesting question. It seems to me that, by jolting inanimate objects into action-movie service, “Night at the Museum” does its part to encourage the museum world’s embrace of spectacle, sensationalism and pseudo-pedagogical pop-cultural pandering. (A brief attempt to mock this tendency is by far the least convincing thing in the movie.)So don’t take your children expecting that they’ll learn anything. But if you do take them, you will at least be able to enjoy Hank Azaria and Amy Adams, who play a fictitious pharaoh named Kahmunrah and the famed aviatrix Amelia Earhart. Historical accuracy is not the point. No Egyptian potentate ever spoke in a lisping, aristocratic British accent, but Mr. Azaria is the master of funny voices, and he does fine work as the heavy. Ms. Adams, impersonating Earhart as a flame-haired screwball-comedy heroine, is entirely delightful, though whether the pioneering pilot would ever have developed a crush on Ben Stiller is a matter for scholars to ponder. Perhaps the only such matter in this shallow and harmlessly diverting picture.“Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

After a while, though — and against your better judgment — you kind of fall in love with it.Not that either of this movie’s lead characters, an elitist Yalie and a washed-up Olympian, is particularly admirable. As Sherman, a recent law school graduate and uptight mama’s boy, Michael Shulman embodies the kind of preppy privilege that’s a liability almost anywhere but Manhattan. But it’s James Le Gros,  playing a disgruntled former ski champion named Palmer, who finally pulls you in: his shaggy charm cushions both Sherman’s neuroses and the script’s manipulations.The pair meet when Sherman, stranded in California after an impetuous decision goes awry, needs a ride to an internship in Beverly Hills. Enter Palmer with a stolen MGB roadster, a carpe diem mentality and a character arc as visible as his immaturity.Nevertheless the director, Craig Saavedra, generates surprising warmth from the familiar tropes of the odd-couple road movie.  Shooting mostly in the verdant sweep of California’s wine country — and with a superb supporting cast — he allows Mr. Le Gros room to engage.

What her character has lost, though, isn’t her offspring — it’s her marbles.As Lee, a traumatized American photographer who has taken refuge in a Sicilian hotel after a harrowing trip to Libya, the doughty Ms. Keener is rarely out of our sight. Baggy-eyed and ashen-faced, Lee turns her room into a bunker, licking her wounds and ignoring her incessantly ringing phone. Why she doesn’t just turn it off is only one of this film’s many annoyances. Aiming for a moody portrait of psychological distress, Mark Jackson directs with a sluggish pace, an abstract style and a dismal aesthetic that rebuff involvement. Releasing information in stingy dribbles, he shadows his tormented heroine as she creeps around the hotel and loiters near a Muslim detainment camp. Things brighten (at least for anyone who enjoys an actual story) when she becomes involved with a pregnant Tunisian migrant (Hafsia Herzi) who’s desperate to escape both Italy and motherhood. But whenever the script comes close to touching on anything interesting — like Italy’s  treatment of immigrants — it shies away to pursue yet another of Lee’s mopey walkabouts.It’s all quite trying, like watching a depressed duck paddle around a muddy pond.

Set in a near or far future in a segregated city that resembles the separated, weirdly depopulated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles (where it was shot), the movie imagines a world in which everyone stops aging at 25. (Just like in Hollywood!) On that birthday a glowing green digital clock on everyone’s left forearm starts running, giving them just 365 days to go and then 364, 363, 362. When the days run out, the clock stops for good.In this futureworld in which time is literally money — everything, including food, shelter and wages, is valued in minutes, hours, years, decades — it’s possible to slow the escaping hourglass sand by buying more time, as the rich do. The poor, of course, are slaves to time: many die young and stay pretty, and are preyed on by time bandits called Minute Men, who clean clocks at gunpoint.In the ghetto, an industrial-looking time zone called Dayton where Will (Justin Timberlake) lives, most people only scrape together a few extra hours. At 28, he has managed to put three additional years on his life, but the cost of breathing keeps going up. What set him back an hour yesterday may take two hours off his life tomorrow.It’s a resonant, er, timely premise, something that Philip K. Dick might have typed up at the height of his frenzied paranoia. It’s also in keeping with the same themes about life and its simulations that have been grist for its writer and director, Andrew Niccol. In his 1997 film, “Gattaca,” biology is destiny to such a degree that any imperfection, no matter how slight, condemns the DNA-challenged to second-class status. (Its hero, played by Ethan Hawke, “passes” as perfect.) If “Gattaca” also worked as a metaphor for the movie industry, it’s because Mr. Niccol let his story serve his ideas; in “Simone,” though, a leaden, mirthless satire about a superstar who’s a software program, he wielded his ideas like a bludgeon, pounding them in until the film was dead on the screen.“In Time” is closer to “Gattaca” and plays like something of a self-conscious, often clever amendment to that earlier film. In “Gattaca” the multiracial, multiethnic elect who have been genetically engineered to idealized type effectively function as a master race. “In Time” resurrects the master-slave dialectic and also invokes the Holocaust, specifically in the shots of the dead and poor who lie where they fall. For the most part, Mr. Niccol doesn’t continue down this perilous avenue, though like other filmmakers he can’t resist tricking out his resident storm troopers, a policelike unit known as the Timekeepers, in regulation black and shiny, shiny leather. Despite these nods at that old fascinating fascism, Mr. Niccol appears to be going for something a touch lighter.The trouble is that romping and lightness don’t come naturally to him. The story opens with Will wishing his mother, Rachel (the young, dewy Olivia Wilde, in an amusing bit of casting), a happy 50th. The two live in an artfully dilapidated apartment with gated windows in Dayton, one of a number of different zones that constitute the new political and geographic order. Will has little sense of the world beyond the ghetto, though he has heard of an almost mythological zone named New Greenwich. He gets a chance to go over that rainbow when a stranger, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer, from the cable show “White Collar”), transfers a century over to Will, a bequest that brings new life and some familiar genre danger.Hamilton’s gift isn’t purely altruistic: he’s wrung out at 105, tired, and it allows him to tap out his own reserves, leading to his death. The Timekeepers try to blame Will, who meanwhile splits for the rarefied clime of New Greenwich, where everyone moves as slow as molasses because, yes, they have all the time in the world, as Mr. Niccol makes sure to state — and restate — in his screenplay. There Will meets Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), a doll with a red bob and anime eyes whose father (a fine Vincent Kartheiser, of “Mad Men”) helps control the global time market. At a soirée, the Timekeepers, led by an excellent Cillian Murphy, as Raymond Leon, burst in. Will grabs the girl and a gun and bolts, rushing out the door and into what soon becomes a couple-on-the-run flick.There’s plenty to enjoy about that genre standard, which, with the help of the cinematographer Roger Deakins (shooting in digital), Mr. Niccol transforms into a neonoir gaudily washed in green and gold. There’s a memorable night scene when Will and Sylvia sprint across a succession of roofs pursued by Raymond, the camera racing parallel with the couple, the exuberance of their freedom and flight palpable. Here, as in other scenes where Mr. Niccol lets his images do the talking, the movie works, despite its wavering tone and slow-and-go energy. But then the characters open their mouths and start going on about minutes and hours, clocks and watches, and their time running out and not having enough time and where’s my time, don’t waste my time, that time will get you killed, brother can you spare some time because, well, I’m all out.“In Time” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

This potent documentary elicits those kinds of reactions.Directed by Amy Berg (“Deliver Us From Evil”), the film centers on a handful of young men who say that as child actors they were sexually assaulted by older men in the entertainment industry. Manipulations, cover-ups and exploitations are recounted, and in several cases accountability was weak; some of the culprits, we’re told, still work in Hollywood.The victims and their parents defy the stereotype of hard-driving dream-seekers. They come across as merely trusting, which led them to rely on those who promised successful careers. Such faith was exploited by men who later turned out to be predators.“He just told me it’s normal, like, this goes on all the time, this is what you have to do,” one young man says he was told after being molested by his manager. “Everybody does this.” Shame and fear of reprisals initially led him to stay silent, and may be keeping more victims from speaking out.Ms. Berg connects that manager, Martin Weiss, who pleaded no contest to two counts of child molestation in 2012, to a string of other men in Hollywood who have also been accused or convicted of similar crimes. Except for a secretly taped conversation and some menacing music, she resists the urge to sensationalize. Such composure is admirable, but further aggressive reporting is needed. This topic deserves a tenacious call for answers.Still, “An Open Secret” is affecting, particularly when the victims recount their experiences in voices that crack with emotion or pause with pain. Even if you do look away, hearing them speak is enough.“An Open Secret” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explicit stories of sexual abuse.",0,,,0
716,2017-01-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:26,RACHEL SALTZ,"Review: Shah Rukh Khan as ‘Raees,’ a Villain but Still a Do-Gooder","The “king of Bollywood,” Shah Rukh Khan, rarely plays the villain. His specialty has been goofball sweetie-pies: romantics, naïfs, the occasional superhero with a runny nose. So it’s not surprising that as the criminal title character in Rahul Dholakia’s “Raees” — a bootlegger turned kingpin turned politician turned folk hero — he’s more populist do-gooder than villain, a man whose heart is mostly gold, tarnished but unmistakable.Set in Gujarat, in the 1980s and ’90s, the movie depicts an India of petty corruption, with cops and politicians on the take, and honor among thieves more aspirational than real. “This world is broken,” Raees says in voice-over. “You have to turn crooked to fix it.” And so he does, in a time-honored movie way. In one scene, he beats up a derelict factory owner at a drive-in, as the big screen shows Amitabh Bachchan, Hindi cinema’s original Angry Young Fix-It Man, threatening a boss who is careless with workers’ lives.Avoiding flabby subplots, Mr. Dholakia keeps “Raees” taut and suspenseful, even at two and a half hours, though it probably has a song too many. (A classic Item Girl number, with Sunny Leone, seems torn between leering and being frank about the sexual threat inherent in … leering.)Raees is a Muslim with ecumenical good will: He sends meals to Hindu families in need as well as Muslims. And he has a stated belief that “no faith is greater than business.” But in real life, business can have borders — some drawn, like India and Pakistan’s, by faith. Indian film producers voted last year not to employ Pakistanis, and Pakistan has banned Indian shows. That means Mahira Khan (no relation to Shah Rukh), the Pakistani actress making her Hindi movie debut as Raees’s wife, has been barred from promoting the film in India, and it won’t be shown in Pakistan.

With a determination forged in the heat of the civil rights movement, he expounds a tough-love pedagogical philosophy that, over the last 30 years, has transformed a failing, formerly Roman Catholic facility into a first-rate college-prep institution.If only “The Providence Effect” had shown us how. More an infomercial than a movie, Rollin Binzer’s awed documentary is, at best, a well-earned tribute to one man’s unwavering vision and unrelenting hard work. Though we hear repeatedly the lack of tolerance for drugs, gangs or “foolishness,” the means of their eradication remain a mystery. Instead, we enjoy a parade of charismatic teachers (“I don’t like teaching, I like teaching here”), stunningly successful alumni, uniformly gung-ho parents and articulate, shiny-faced students thrilled to be hitting the books.While undeniably heartwarming, the school’s inspirational model does nothing to persuade us of its universal utility. “This is how it should be done,” says President Reagan on a 1982 visit to the school; but the statement’s implicit attack on the public-school system allows for no defense. Dark mutterings about union problems and mysterious red tape are hastily bypassed, with no education experts or policymakers on hand to elucidate.In other words, there are reasons that Mr. Adams’s methods may not be imitable outside the private-school system; “The Providence Effect” simply prefers not to discuss them.“The Providence Effect” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

718,2012-01-13,The Iron Lady,"Meryl Streep, Jim Broadbent, Susan Brown, Alice da Cunha","UK, France",Phyllida Lloyd,"Biography, Drama",English,54.0,105.0,Abi Morgan (screenplay),2011,6.4,93790.0,51.0,2017-11-02 04:18:14,A. O. SCOTT,Polarizing Leader Fades Into the Twilight,"The best thing about “The Iron Lady” may be that viewers going into the theater with strong views, pro or con, about its subject, the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, are likely to emerge in a state of greater ambivalence, even confusion. Those who know or care little about her will also be confused, but for different reasons.Let’s stick with the first group for the moment. Nearly anyone who was alive and reading newspapers — or listening to English-language pop music — in the Western world in the 1980s probably has an opinion about Mrs. Thatcher. To the ideological right she was a hero, even more than her friend Ronald Reagan, whereas the left saw her as a monster. There may have been some mixed feelings in the middle, but she herself had little use for such wishy-washiness, reserving special scorn for the “wet” and the “wobbly” on her own side.Nor, if the film is to be believed — and it is, in its way, a credible enough portrait — did she have much patience for the discussion or display of feelings of any kind. When a doctor asks the aging Thatcher (played with brilliant slyness and sly brilliance by Meryl Streep) how she is feeling, he is answered with an impromptu lecture on the over-emotionalism of modern culture and a stout defense of the supreme importance of thinking. Ideas are what matter, she insists, and I suspect that a great many people of various ages and political inclinations would agree.But it does not seem that Phyllida Lloyd, who directed “The Iron Lady,” and Abi Morgan, who wrote the screenplay, are among them. Though the film pays lip service to Mrs. Thatcher’s analytic intelligence and tactical shrewdness, its focus is on the drama and pathos of her personal life. In her dotage, watched over by professionally cheery minders, she putters about in a haze of half-senile nostalgia, occasionally drawn back into the glory and pain of the past.Between flashbacks that trace her journey from modest beginnings — the phrase “grocer’s daughter from Grantham” is attached to her like a Homeric epithet — through the leadership of the Conservative Party and beyond, Thatcher is visited by the ghost of her husband, Denis (Jim Broadbent), and by her daughter, Carol (Olivia Colman). Carol’s twin brother, Mark, unseen in the film, is far away in South Africa, his distance emphasizing his mother’s loneliness and isolation. Denis’s shade is genial, mischievous company, but also a reminder of what has been lost and what might have been.All of this is touching to witness. Stiff legged and slow moving, behind a discreetly applied ton of geriatric makeup, Ms. Streep provides, once again, a technically flawless impersonation that also seems to reveal the inner essence of a well-known person. Her portrayal of Mrs. Thatcher in power, while equally impeccable, is limited by the film’s vague and cursory treatment of her political career. “The Iron Lady” is, above all, the story of a widow and a half-abandoned mother who happened — didn’t you know? — to have been one of the most powerful and consequential women of the 20th century.Would the life of a male politician be rendered this way? Is this an unfair question? It seems to me that Ms. Lloyd and Ms. Morgan try to have it both ways, to celebrate their heroine as a feminist pioneer while showing her to be tragically unfulfilled according to traditional standards of feminine accomplishment. On her first day as a member of Parliament, Margaret (played in those early years by Alexandra Roach, with Harry Lloyd as a smiling young Denis) pulls out of the driveway as her children chase after her car, begging her not to leave them. Later she announces her intention to seek the party leadership on the day that Carol has passed her driving test, earning a rare rebuke from her husband for putting herself first.As a young woman she faces down the condescension of powerful and entitled Tories with a mixture of charm and steel, communicating her acute awareness of sexism and class prejudice in a way that makes her eventual triumph inspiring. But as the film reckons the cost of this triumph to Mrs. Thatcher and her family, it suggests that the double standards she fought against still flourish. In trying to make her more human, more sympathetic, the filmmakers turn a self-made, highly original woman into something of a cliché.They also manage to push the great passion and distinction of her life — her pursuit and exercise of power — into the background. This is not unusual in biopics, which frequently turn artists into substance abusers and sexual adventurers who just happened to cut a few records or paint a few pictures on their way to redemption. “The Iron Lady,” following this template, makes a particular hash of British history, compressing social and economic turmoil into a shorthand that resembles a chronologically scrambled British version of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” (Miners’ strike/Falklands War/I can’t take it any more ... .)In general the film is more attuned to process than to policy, which is conveyed by means of a few catch phrases and snippets of archival news footage. We learn that Mrs. Thatcher took on the unions, the I.R.A., the Argentine junta and more than a few of her allies, at times angering segments of the public to the point of insurrection while winning three consecutive elections, a modern record. The cabinet meetings and backroom dealings are quite entertaining. Richard E. Grant as Michael Heseltine and Anthony Head as Geoffrey Howe stand out from the crowd of grousing toffs in chalk-striped suits, though of course not as much as Ms. Streep. But it will be hard for anyone not familiar with the story to have much sense of what is at stake.As for “The Iron Lady” itself, beyond the challenge it poses for Ms. Streep, its own reason for being is a bit obscure. It is likely to be the definitive screen treatment of Mrs. Thatcher, at least for a while, and yet it does not really define her in any surprising or trenchant way.

Mr. Miyazaki remains enchanted with the idea of being airborne, which animation freely lends itself to, having sent little girls, castles and even swine into flight. “ The Wind Rises ,” his newest film, tells the fictionalized story of Jiro Horikoshi, a gifted aeronautic engineer who is historically notable — or infamous — for designing deadly warplanes used by Japan in World War II. Mr. Miyazaki’s lyrical chronicle of the inventor’s creative process and his poignant romance reminds us that staying aloft is a fraught endeavor. Yet even in this film about an absorbed artist of the floating world, premonitions of the calamitous events to come cannot be entirely absent.Jiro is a natural and unpretentious solver of engineering challenges of all kinds. He notices the promising possibilities that a fish bone suggests for an airplane wing, and with his trusty slide rule he makes a splint for the injured caretaker of a girl named Nahoko, a fellow train passenger, after the caretaker is hurt in Japan’s devastating 1923 earthquake. The depiction of the disaster is typical of Miyazaki’s virtuosic technique: the earth erupts with rippling, ramshackle motion, rising up and snapping like a rug as the artfully organic sound design summons groans and burps.The plot of “The Wind Rises” is episodic, following Jiro from one project to another, portraying the creative process through sudden sequences suggesting his dream life. Though his days might be spent at a drafting table overseen by a benevolent troll of a boss, his inspirations come in lucid visions and plays of form. The air pioneer Gianni Caproni, his mustachioed mentor, supplies a spirited, wise perspective during Jiro’s stops and starts on his projects.The film’s heart lies in Jiro’s innovative career and in his touching bond with Nahoko. They cross paths again at a mountain resort that she visits as a tuberculosis sufferer in the company of her father (who, in an offhand detail, seems to share Jiro’s loping gait). Mindful of her illness, Jiro and Nahoko marry quickly, and their relationship is shaped by their dwindling time together. After a coughing fit, hers is basically the only blood we see, perhaps notable in a movie about warplanes.Between the earthquake and Jiro’s sometimes apocalyptic dreams, the film’s fanciful sequences seem to tap into Japan’s troubled unconscious, as if anticipating the cataclysms to come. That history has brought criticism in Japan, where some have cast the film as antipatriotic, and has led to a certain caution in its United States marketing because of how sympathetically it treats the creator of a machine used in the attack on Pearl Harbor and in kamikaze missions.Yet just as with Isao Takahata’s “Grave of the Fireflies,” about two children surviving amid the terrors of World War II, it would be hard to argue that the subject of Mr. Miyazaki’s film was cavalierly seized upon. It is a considered choice, as Mr. Miyazaki is mindful that the inventor’s process is not necessarily focused on moral implications.Mr. Miyazaki, 72, has stated with more finality than in past declarations that “The Wind Rises” is his last film. And like Shakespeare’s “Tempest,” it feels partly like a concluding reflection on creation and destruction. Its sonic quietude and mostly subdued palette, unusual for a striking colorist like Mr. Miyazaki, are almost unnerving. But Jiro’s world is not immune to upheaval, and Mr. Miyazaki does interrupt this idyllic view with the inflamed red of a fire at a university and of Nahoko’s blood.Yet Jiro’s head is ultimately in his work and the preciously cocooned love of his wife, not the world at large. And just as we know that Jiro and Nahoko’s bliss has an end, so too are we aware that the bubble in which he toils will not last forever. But Mr. Miyazaki renders Jiro’s life and dreams with lyrical elegance and aching poignancy. At one point, Caproni advises Jiro that artists have 10 years of peak creativity. Yet “The Wind Rises,” with its complex diminuendo, underlines Mr. Miyazaki’s much longer, richly creative odyssey.",0,,4342709.0,0

J. Miller, Kate McKinnon and Rob Corddry are involved. But how did the normally dignified Courtney B. Vance fall in with this crowd?Who knows, but he’s pretty hilarious playing against type in “Office Christmas Party,” a broad, bawdy comedy full of familiar faces behaving outlandishly.Mr. Miller, appealing as always, pairs well with Jennifer Aniston as a brother and sister — Clay and Carol — who have inherited a tech company but have radically different approaches to running it. Carol, the chief executive, is all business — the Scrooge of this Christmas story — while Clay, who runs the Chicago branch, has heart and a concern for his employees’ happiness. When Carol cancels the holiday party, Clay stages one anyway, hoping to use it to impress a potential client (Mr. Vance).The party, of course, spins wildly out of control. In the process, romance blossoms (or doesn’t) among some of the employees; Ms. McKinnon’s character, a no-fun human-resources officer, loosens up; and an appalling new use is found for a 3-D printer. Mr. Vance — yes, the same guy who just won an Emmy for playing Johnnie Cochran — attempts a Tarzan impersonation, using a string of Christmas lights as his vine, a party trick that goes hilariously awry.Sometimes the movie, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck, is too obviously just a framework for its stars to deploy goofy schtick, but the overall package is naughty, inappropriate fun.",0,54730514.0,54767494.0,1

SCOTT,"Superheroes, Super Battles, Super Egos","Scientists estimate that we reached Peak Superhero in the summer of 2008, when “The Dark Knight” sucked the attention of every critic, pundit and sentient moviegoer into its inky nexus. It is not as if the number of movies featuring troubled guys wearing costumes and fighting evil has diminished since then. Quite the contrary. But the genre, though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy, has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence. (Do you really want to have an argument about this? If so, put on your best oversize metal suit and wait for me at the top of the New York Times building. I’ll be there as soon as I finish beta-testing my death ray. Apologies in advance to any commuters crushed by flying debris.) The latest evidence — though it is unlikely to be the last, with a new “Spider-Man” and another “Dark Knight” looming on the horizon — is “Marvel’s The Avengers.”You may occasionally encounter (as I have, a few times in the past months) a walking relic of an earlier era of pop-cultural fandom who wonders if they have, at last, made another movie out of that fondly recalled British spy series from the 1960s. “They” have not, and those poor souls who cherish old daydreams of Diana Rigg in leather will have to console themselves with images of Scarlett Johansson in a black bodysuit.So “The Avengers,” which has been foreshadowed by post-credits teasers in (deep breath), “Captain America,” “Thor,” “The Incredible Hulk” (the one with Edward Norton) and both “Iron Man” pictures, is not without its pleasures. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, this movie revels in the individuality of its mighty, mythical characters, pinpointing insecurities that are amplified by superhuman power and catching sparks that fly when big, rough-edged egos (and alter egos) collide. The best scenes are not the overblown, skull-assaulting action sequences — which add remarkably little that will be fresh or surprising to devotees of the “Transformers” franchise — but the moments in between, when the assembled heroes have the opportunity to brag, banter, flirt and bicker.The secret of “The Avengers” is that it is a snappy little dialogue comedy dressed up as something else, that something else being a giant A.T.M. for Marvel and its new studio overlords, the Walt Disney Company. At times — when various members of a game and nimble cast amble in and out of the glassy, metallic chambers of a massive flying aircraft carrier, cracking wise, rolling eyes and occasionally throwing a punch — the movie has some of the easygoing charm of “Rio Bravo,” Howard Hawks’s great, late western in which John Wayne, Angie Dickinson, Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson did a lot of talking on their way to a big and not-all-that-interesting shootout.The difference is that, in keeping with the imperatives of global franchise entertainment, the big shootout in “The Avengers” must be enormous, of a scale and duration that obliterates everything else. A hole opens in the sky, disgorging metallic warriors on Jet Skis and big snakey things that inflict serious digital damage on the Manhattan skyline. Before that there are similarly overdone combat sequences. None of them matches, in cinematic wit or visceral surprise, a sucker punch landed by the Hulk on Thor’s lantern jaw or a cartoonish smackdown delivered by that same angry green fellow on Loki, Thor’s adoptive brother and this episode’s main villain.Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a disgraced Asgardian princeling with a spear and magic helmet, is after the tesseract, a glowing blue cube of pure energy. With the help of a couple of brainwashed turncoats, Loki has pried it away from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), a world-government spymaster with a lot of semi-secret projects up his sleeve. He assembles a team to get it back, consisting of the guys we’ve seen in the other movies (including Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, the series’s hardest-working nonsuperhero and its most reliable comic asset), as well as Ms. Johansson’s Black Widow. Eventually Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye joins up too, mostly to glower and shoot a lot of arrows.Mr. Jackson, with an eye patch and his well-practiced bellow, is more master of ceremonies than mission commander, and under his watch the Avengers indulge in some Rat Pack-y horsing around. Captain America (Chris Evans) is teased for being an out-of-touch old-timer, Thor for being a longhaired deity from another planet. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is his usual mischievous playboy self, distinguishable from Sherlock Holmes at this point thanks only to his accent and the brief presence of Gwyneth Paltrow in his penthouse. The newcomer — and every intellectual’s favorite comic-book-based movie character from now on — is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, a mopey, hesitant genius who turns large and green when angry.“I’m always angry,” he says at one point, and while “The Avengers” is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre. Mr. Whedon’s playful, democratic pop sensibility is no match for the glowering authoritarianism that now defines Hollywood’s comic-book universe. Some of the rebel spirit of Mr. Whedon’s early projects “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Firefly” and “Serenity” creeps in around the edges but as detail and decoration rather than as the animating ethos.“I aim to misbehave,” Malcolm Reynolds famously said in “Serenity.” But for all their maverick swagger, the Avengers are dutiful corporate citizens, serving a conveniently vague set of principles. Are they serving private interests, big government, their own vanity, or what? It hardly matters, because the true guiding spirit of their movie is Loki, who promises to set the human race free from freedom and who can be counted on for a big show wherever he goes. In Germany he compels a crowd to kneel before him in mute, terrified awe, and “The Avengers,” which recently opened there to huge box office returns, expects a similarly submissive audience here at home. The price of entertainment is obedience.“Marvel’s The Avengers” is rated PG-13. Blam. Splat. Kapow. Mostly bloodless.",0,623279547.0,621414627.0,0

Sure enough, a ruthless operative (Wallace Huo) from a competing company is on the loose, willing to do anything to get the data Xia Tian and her colleagues are working on.Because the process has not been completely successful, Xia Tian’s lab has prohibited human subjects from entering the portal.

Thanks to the portal, we are treated to three simultaneous manifestations of Xia Tian, which is about one more than we can easily keep track of when they are engaged in a gun battle.There is shooting and stabbing galore, a clever kidnapping-by-truck routine and breathtaking car chases, as well as a harrowing scene of our heroine sliding down a long conveyor belt that feeds a bubbling caldron of waste.Over all, this is an exciting film if not a completely cohesive one, but Xia Tian’s ultimate decision about her career is a disappointment.

But there is nothing stodgy about them. The strenuous rock ’n’ roll life has left them sinewy and lean, like longtime marathon runners. (The staid, above-it-all drummer, Charlie Watts, is the exception.)Mr. Jagger’s lined face, with its deflated balloon lips, suggests a double exposure of Dorian Gray and his infamous portrait, at once defiantly youthful and creepily gaunt. The simian Mr. Richards, whose upper arm flesh has shriveled, resembles an old madam chewing over her secrets. As he plays, his lips dangling a cigarette, he leans back into his snarling guitar and a joyful grin spreads across his face. He could be the world’s happiest young older man: Peter Pan as a wizened Gypsy fortuneteller.For the Rolling Stones appear supremely alive inside their giant, self-created rock ’n’ roll machine. The sheer pleasure of making music that keens and growls like a pack of ravenous alley cats is obviously what keeps them going. Why should they ever stop? At the heart of the gizmo, Mr. Jagger whirls, leaps, struts, wiggles his tiny hips and sashays around like an androgynous tart prowling a street corner at 3  a.m.Ultimately the movie is Mr. Jagger’s show. If his long-running circus act is ridiculous when you analyze it, conjoined to the Stones’ music, it becomes a phenomenal high-wire exhibition of agility, stamina and cheek. He was 63 when the concert was filmed over two nights at the Beacon Theater in New York in the fall of 2006. From certain angles, when the blazing lights hit his face, he suggests an agitated zombie with a full head of hair. But if you squint until your vision blurs, he is the same tireless, taunting cock of the walk that he has always been.The film, which used 18 cameras, many operated by eminent cinematographers, is an unabashedly reverent tribute to the Stones made in the same spirit as “The Last Waltz,” Mr. Scorsese’s elegiac 1978 movie of the Band’s farewell concert, and his more recent Bob Dylan biography, “No Direction Home.” That said, it is far less ambitious, and less overtly romantic.This is a concert film with frills  that places you on the stage with the band and, with a finely trained eye, observes the musicians’ interactions  with one another and with the audience. The visual rhythms and unobtrusive editing reflect the contradictory status of the Stones as a majestic rock institution and a gang of down-and-dirty bad boys thumbing their noses at propriety while scooping up all the girls.Although there is no frantic cutting back and forth, the cameras are continually on the move. As the movie artfully shifts its gaze, it helps you see much more than you could if you actually attended the concert. The audience is largely ignored.Mr. Scorsese is a besotted rock ’n’ roll fan who wholeheartedly embraces its mythology. Its scruffy guitar heroes and roustabout rebel-prophets are the musical equivalents of the hotheads and outlaws who populate so many of his films. Almost every shot of “Shine a Light” conveys his excitement.Prefaced by preconcert footage and interwoven with excerpts from television interviews from the Stones’ younger days,  going back to 1964, “Shine a Light” makes no attempt to explain the Stones or to tell their story. All it wants to do is to give you the best seat in the house and the best sound you could possibly hope for.The program is a best-of selection that concentrates on Stones classics, including “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” “Shattered,” “Some Girls,”  “Tumbling Dice,”  “Sympathy for the Devil,”  “Start Me Up” and “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.”  The only misfire is the quaint, quasi chamber-pop ballad “As Tears Go By,” a  hit for Marianne Faithfull in 1964, which sounds incongruous in Mr. Jagger’s parched delivery. Otherwise, the full-tilt rock concert roars along like a steam engine. A horn section, a keyboardist (Chuck Leavell), a bass guitarist (Darryl Jones) and three backup singers augment the band.There are three special guests: in ascending order of interest, Jack White, who trades vocals with Mr. Jagger on “Loving Cup”;  Christina Aguilera, who shares the vocals on “Live With Me” and bestows demure pecks on the cheek to the musicians as she leaves the stage; and the great blues guitarist and singer Buddy Guy performing an old Muddy Waters song, “Champagne and Reefer.” (There is also the Clinton family in the audience, on hand to celebrate Bill Clinton’s 60th birthday.)Like Muddy Waters, whom I saw in the Beacon Theater shortly before his death in 1983 at 70, Mr. Guy, 70 when “Shine a Light” was filmed, is a mighty blues presence, one who puts the Stones in historical perspective. Muddy Waters was an ominous force of raw blues aggression. Mr. Guy, though equally imposing, is a more benign, patriarchal figure.Beside him, Mr. Jagger and company are mischievous bohemian whippersnappers churning up variations on their elders’ musical bedrock. It is  obviously a thrilling game to play into your 60s and beyond, if you’ve still got the juice. And the Stones have  the juice. But it is ultimately just a game.“Shine a Light” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for drug references in the songs, and smoking.SHINE A LIGHTOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Martin Scorsese; director of photography, Robert Richardson; edited by David Tedeschi; music by the Rolling Stones; produced by Victoria Pearman, Michael Cohl, Zane Weiner and Steve Bing; released by Paramount Pictures.

Set in what looks like a succession of B-movie studio sets, the film brings to mind a Hope and Crosby road movie, though only if Bob and Bing, after studying the Bible as children and reading Nietzsche as adults, were grappling with issues of faith.Filling Hope and Crosby’s clown shoes nicely in “Year One” are Jack Black and Michael Cera as  Paleolithic tribesmen. Zed (Mr. Black) is an inept hunter with a wayward spear while Oh (Mr. Cera) is a gentle gatherer who murmurs sweet nothings to his berries. After Zed is banished by the tribe for his blunders, the two hit a surrealistic road that takes them from the forest to the desert with stops along the prehistory and history continuum. Before they depart, however, Zed bites into a golden apple he plucks from the forbidden tree of knowledge, a defiant act that awakens his mind. “Everything is weird,” he declares with philosophical purity. Not long after he is down on his hands and knees sampling human scat.Everything is indeed weird in Mr. Ramis’s highbrow slapstick, in which theological questions are smuggled in between silly bits about excrement and body hair. Much as Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner did with the 2,000 Year Old Man, Mr. Ramis, who wrote the screenplay with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, is playing with history, or rather with the serious stories familiar from religious instruction and Hollywood epics. “Is it true that you were at the scene of the Crucifixion some 2,000 years ago?” Mr. Reiner asks the 2,000 Year Old Man. “Oh, boy! I knew Christ,” Mr. Brooks replies. “Thin lad. Always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store, no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.”In “Year One” Zed and Oh keep up a similarly nonsensical running conversation during their travels, which take them first to a meadow where they meet two pastoral types, one of whom has a really bad attitude. That would be Cain (David Cross), who’s soon brutally whaling on his brother, Abel (Paul Rudd). (“You want some of that?”) Er, spoiler alert! Cain kills Abel, beating him to death with a rock. Mr. Ramis stages the murder with so many (off-screen) blows that the scene rapidly morphs from funny to queasily humorous to just plain unpleasant before rebounding to the uneasily comic. Mr. Ramis likes to push humor to its tasteless edge, but the violence here feels almost personal, as if he were wielding that rock.In some ways that’s precisely what he’s doing in “Year One,” which, as Zed and Oh amble through different historical periods and Bible stories, takes knowing and often profane swats at the sacred. Cain proves to be a real pest (a nice observation on the persistence of evil), and things go from bad to worse. Zed and Oh are sold into slavery and marched across the desert by Romans with British accents. They escape, only to inadvertently persuade Abraham (Hank Azaria wearing a long glued-on beard) not to slay Isaac (Christopher  Mintz-Plasse). Jokes about snipped foreskins and the Holy Land’s borders ensue, as does a trip to Sodom, leading to an assortment of predictable, if unprintable, puns and yuks.In his 1981 satire “The History of the World, Part I,” Mr. Brooks revisits the past, starting with the dawn of hirsute man and ending with the French Revolution, tossing in some religious broadsides along the way. Mr. Ramis, by contrast, fashions a seamless narrative from Zed and Oh’s adventures, jettisoning the usual time frames associated with these foundation stories to create something of an ahistorical collage. In this film Stone Age man walks alongside Roman centurions and heroes and villains from the Old Testament, which suggests that when Mr. Ramis hasn’t been listening to old comedy routines he’s been boning up on the debate about evolution versus creationism. Riffing on the movie’s title: in the beginning there were multiple beginnings, each good for lots of laughs.For the most part those laughs are generous, tasteless, groaningly goofy and irresistible, though I wish the filmmakers had resisted the temptation to sacrifice, for an unnecessary gag, a Sodomite priest (Oliver Platt) who had taken a liking to Oh. By that point the film has run out of steam, having mined various B-movie clichés (the kind in which prehistoric women wear eyeliner) and even taken a time out for a discourse on God. I would like to think that the final scene, which finds Mr. Ramis playing Noah and sending Zed and Oh off with female mates, was a lazy afterthought, simply an admission of how the past was written. Here’s hoping that in “Year Two” the Stone Age finally gives way to Stonewall.“Year One” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Simon1 hour 25 minutes; not ratedLike the Upper East Side penthouse in which it unfolds, the documentary “Unraveled” is cool and elegant, echoing with spaces for our imaginations to fill. The home’s chastened owner is Marc Dreier, the Manhattan lawyer whose serial embezzlement of hundreds of millions of dollars from hedge funds and clients would end, finally, in a 2009 fraud conviction. The how of Mr. Dreier’s actions has been well documented; the why may never be answered.Filming over eight weeks during Mr. Dreier’s house arrest before sentencing, the director, Marc H. Simon, tries to get at the why by allowing Mr. Dreier to do what he does best: talk. Armed with forged documents and other people’s credit, he talked his way into one swindle after another, all of which he recounts with matter-of-fact clarity and a faintly regretful air. This isn’t the chest-beating remorse of the cornered coward; rather, Mr. Dreier refuses to betray either his intellect or the vim, ingenuity and sheer chutzpah required to maintain his various ruses.“I lost my way,” he admits, and part of the film’s fascination lies in its portrait of a brilliant mind running its own diagnostic check. Though Mr. Simon, a former employee, has handed Mr. Dreier a stage from which to plead his case, what emerges is more reflective than confessional. As our eyes stray to outlines on the walls where Hockney and Warhol once hung, and a pair of armed guards sit silently watching television, Mr. Dreier wonders why, when the financial system began to crumble, he didn’t just remain safely in Dubai instead of returning to perpetuate a final, desperate scam. So do we.Bolstered by animated re-enactments and Bob Richman’s frosty cinematography, “Unraveled” is a mesmerizing one-man dive into narcissism, entitlement and unchecked greed. “It’s easy to say you would never cross the line, but the line is presented to very few people,” Mr. Dreier comments wryly at the start of the film. And that’s probably how it needs to stay.",1,,,0

He drives a vintage car and owns a typewriter. When not pulling heists for a mob boss (Victor Colicchio), he is sharpening knives or stoically watching a Max Fleischer cartoon.In an awkwardly edited device, he is haunted by the abusive headmaster (Tom Sizemore) of the orphanage where he was raised. It doesn’t help that Mr. Sizemore, mumbling dialogue about animal skin as he readies a belt for a beating, is barely intelligible.After an encounter with Jackie (Bianca Hunter), Frank impulsively enrolls in a creative-writing class in Queens. He churns out pages of terse Mickey Spillane-like prose that only he knows is more fact than fiction. Jackie, his classmate, tries to lure him out of his shell, inviting him over for a sandwich. Still, Frank doesn’t display a sense of humor until his life is in jeopardy.Written and directed by Kamal Ahmed, formerly of the Jerky Boys — the comedy duo whose prank-call routines enjoyed inexplicable popularity in the 1990s — “Laugh Killer Laugh” is a tired parody that seems to have been constructed from received notions of noir and mob movies. Even the jazzy score sounds like an affectation.The film serves as an acting exercise for Mr. Forsythe, less recognizable than usual thanks to a ridiculous Klaus Kinski mane.

(The film was shot in New Mexico.) Their assailants are kidnappers (Aaron Tveit and Frank Grillo) who believe they have killed all the passengers save their quarry (Jodi Lynn Thomas), whom they stick in a car trunk. But Dee, though shot, is still alive, and Hazel, who has witnessed the carnage from a concealed spot, must surmount her fears to seek help in the wilderness.The movie bears a sheen belying its low budget, and the director, Jorge Michel Grau, working with the cinematographer Santiago Sánchez, skillfully suggests the vertiginous unease Hazel experiences with her tentative steps into the vast, threatening landscape. Ms. Sedgwick blends working-class sass and maternal backbone, and Mr. Tveit and Mr. Grillo, playing half brothers, have a convincing rapport. The script, by Evan M. Wiener, coheres, though it uses the overfamiliar “Mexican standoff” in its climax.But the film rests on the attractive but opaque Ms. Thorne, who is not ready for such weight. Commendably, she stretches her acting muscles, but Hazel’s internal struggle remains elusive. Viewers need more to connect with.",0,,,1

Waking up on her birthday in a strange man’s dorm room after a supposed one night stand, she stumbles through her day until, en route to her surprise party that night, she is brutally murdered by a masked attacker. Unfortunately, she’s about to experience this particular day again — multiple times.Niftily paced and tight as a chokehold, the script (by the comic-book writer Scott Lobdell) delivers just enough variation to hold our interest. The means of Tree’s expirations are unoriginal and not especially scary, but the director, Christopher Landon, maintains a breezy momentum while she wakes, runs, croaks and repeats. With each resurrection, she’s in slightly worse shape, but marginally better-tempered, giving Ms. Rothe room to deepen the character and arc from unsympathetic victim to loving girlfriend.Rarely out of our sight, Ms. Rothe is inexhaustible and funny, with Israel Broussard a perfect foil as her bemused, sweetly bland love interest. But it’s the newcomer Rachel Matthews as Danielle, the snippy sorority president, who’s the natural comedian. Encased in preppy separates and armed with withering put-downs, Danielle is every bit as deadly as any campus killer.",0,55398005.0,55683845.0,0

It’s not possible.”Apparently he hasn’t been watching enough Luc Besson movies. The director of this potboiler revenge fantasy may be Olivier Megaton (a great action-director name, even if it is pronounced may-gah-TONE). But the guiding spirit is clearly that of Mr. Besson, a writer and producer of the film, who can claim to have created and continually perfected the lethal-woman-in-her-underwear genre to which “Colombiana” belongs.Mr. Besson’s previous avenging waifs have included Anne Parillaud (in the foundational “Femme Nikita”), a very young Natalie Portman (“The Professional”) and an orange-haired Milla Jovovich (“The Fifth Element”). His latest muse is Zoe Saldana, the blue-skinned heroine of “Avatar,” who proves to be equally adept at the essential skill of wielding large guns while wearing skimpy clothing. (Well, maybe not as adept as Ms. Jovovich, who seems to have been genetically engineered for this kind of thing.)What’s not required is the creation of an actual character; the best an actress can hope for is to look good and, if the director and screenwriter cooperate, maintain her dignity and sense of humor. Ms. Saldana, playing an almost supernaturally skilled hit woman and parkour enthusiast whose larger mission is to avenge the murder of her Colombian drug-dealing parents, has to work hard in that regard.That’s because “Colombiana” isn’t content to be a comic-book joyride (though it is that); it has pretensions to a more turgid class of revenge melodrama, along the lines of Tony Scott’s “Man on Fire.” It also has pretensions, period: Mr. Megaton sprinkles in homages to Francis Ford Coppola (Ms. Saldana’s rising out of the water like Martin Sheen in “Apocalypse Now”) and Brian De Palma (the climactic sequence at a drug lord’s lair is redolent of “Scarface”). The overall effect is distancing; there are some early comic moments that have you laughing along with the movie, but eventually the clashing tones and preposterousness just have you laughing.Ms. Saldana has one other thing to overcome: the presence of a wide-eyed 13-year-old actress named Amandla Stenberg, who plays the protagonist, Cataleya Restrepo, at the time her parents are gunned down, in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Her portrayal of the future deadly-but-sensitive killer is such a perfect combination of trembling emotion, action chops and deadpan humor that Ms. Saldana, no matter how sexily professional her work is, spends the rest of the movie failing to live up to it.“Colombiana” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Guns, missiles, torture, sharks.COLOMBIANAOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Olivier Megaton; written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen; director of photography, Romain Lacourbas; edited by Camille Delamarre; music by Nathaniel Mechaly; production design by Patrick Durand; costumes by Olivier Bériot ; produced by Mr. Besson and Ariel Zeitoun; released by TriStar Pictures.

730,2017-02-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:26,JEANNETTE CATSOULIS,Review: ‘I Am Jane Doe’ Takes Aim at Escort Ads,"Some documentaries inspire so much sympathy for their subjects — and outrage on their behalf — that it’s all too easy to miss the fact that what we’re watching is more advocacy than argument.“I Am Jane Doe,” a chronicle of the  continuing fight to hold an online classifieds site liable for the extreme harm resulting from some of its escort ads, falls into that category. Spearheaded by a handful of anguished mothers whose daughters were sold into sex slavery, by way of the website Backpage.com, before they were 16, the serpentine legal proceedings have so far consumed six years and countless courtroom hours. Their greatest obstacle is a 1996 law declaring that websites can’t be held responsible for third-party content.Attempting to simplify a dauntingly complex tangle of rights and responsibilities, the director, Mary Mazzio, has shaped her material into a classic heroes-and-villains showdown. Leading the white hats is the inexhaustible Erik Bauer, a strip-mall Atticus Finch wrapped in denim and moral determination; on the other side there’s Homer King, described by the film as a former pimp, who shares the grooming tactics he used to control the children he calls “just a product.” His few minutes of screen time will freeze the breath in your throat.They might also numb the critical thinking that allows you to notice the movie’s lack of clear definitions for terms like sex trafficking and child sex (which mean different things in different states). How it fails to consider the criminalization of sex work as a possible barrier to rooting out those who exploit minors. Or how the plaintiffs’ demand for age verification of the women in online ads could be almost impossible to put in effect.Instead, Ms. Mazzio, a onetime lawyer, ushers us through court rulings and Senate hearings marked by heartening successes and crushing setbacks. The movie’s most persuasive section shows evidence of possible collusion between the site and some of its advertisers; yet despite an abundance of legal expertise, no one is on hand to substantively address First Amendment rights, or to examine claims that the website is a useful ally in locating and prosecuting traffickers.Without these balancing voices, “I Am Jane Doe” coalesces into a steamroller of pain that squashes our ability to see beyond its wounded families. It’s the tale of a crusade whose horrifying details resist Jessica Chastain’s silky narration. Yet there’s a reason that so far the website keeps winning, and it’s worth at least considering that it might not be a negligible one.",0,,,0

Once again, this one comes to you from the director Ron Howard and his producing partner, Brian Grazer, who bring clenched-jaw commitment and a whole mess of filmmaking to every project, even the most disposable. In this case, the story may not make any sense, but they’re going to throw so much at you — so many jumpy moves, so many tangled threads — that you might not notice (or care).Certainly Mr. Hanks, slipping back into the role of the so-called symbologist Robert Langdon for a third time, is a master of that great Hollywood sleight of hand in which a big star beguiles you so artfully that you don’t see (or simply ignore) the deception. In Mr. Hanks’s case, this legerdemain depends on his natural appeal, which has deepened as he’s settled into stardom, as well as his ability to bring remarkable characters down to earth. That’s especially crucial with a civilian superhero like Langdon, one of those preposterously capable types who wears professorial threads instead of a cape and excels at cracking gnarly codes rather than bad-guy heads.One of the obvious draws of civilian champions, those latter-day Nancy Drews and Hardy Boys, is that they’re inordinately, at times vulnerably, ordinary until they start doing their special thing. So when Langdon first appears in a hospital bed in “Inferno,” groaning in pain amid the woozy camerawork, you’re ready to put a cold compress on his (or, really, Mr. Hanks’s) head. There’s no time. As a director, Mr. Howard tends to be a lead foot, either because he likes it like that (as in his racing movie “Rush”) or knows that one of the smarter ways to handle certain material is to sprint through its twists. Here, he skips ready and set, and just goes.As in the first movies (“The Da Vinci Code” and “Angels & Demons”), Langdon is called on to furrow his brow and fire up his genius to solve a puzzle. The main pieces in “Inferno” include a lethal virus and a megalomaniacal billionaire (Ben Foster), who apparently took his TED Talk too seriously. There’s a shadowy security firm with an enigmatic owner (an amusing Irrfan Khan, who’s ready for Bond villainy) and the World Health Organization, which has been given a sexy makeover with enigmatic players (Omar Sy, Sidse Babett Knudsen) and fleets of gun-toting paramilitaries. There are flying bullets and drones, racing characters and cameras, nods to Dante and Botticelli.Mr. Hanks, who changes young female sidekicks in this series more than he seems to switch jackets, keeps company in this movie with Felicity Jones, as Sienna Brooks, a lethally earnest doctor. She’s at his side in the hospital and soon on the run with him, chasing and being chased while finding clues in destination sites like the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence and St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice. As in a lot of globe-trotting thrillers, these (mostly real) locations are attractive backdrops for the frenetically spinning story and characters. Like the references to classical literature and art, they are also meant to class up the joint, adding some high-culture luster to the pulp.Part of the draw of these movies is that they don’t create beauty, but instead borrow the emotions of the beauty they depict. (This, more or less, is one definition of kitsch, courtesy of the philosopher Tomas Kulka.) That makes the movies easy to watch and easy to forget. As important, their postcard beauty and rented emotions also attenuate some of the less palatable aspects of their conspiracy theories. There’s pleasure in watching characters solve puzzles and turn hunches into facts, yet when scaled up — out of crime labs and onto the global stage — all that problem-solving suggests it’s only supermen like Langdon’s brainiac who can save the world.This savior complex is familiar but it also creates an argument about belief. Unlike in the earlier movies, the Roman Catholic Church is a supporting player in “Inferno,” largely evident in landmarks and cultural touchstones rather than cults and murderous agents. (The script is by David Koepp.) Even so, skepticism about deep faith remains, most obviously in the billionaire’s deranged belief and in the image of bomb-wielding fanatics. By the end, the story has shifted to Turkey and a dubiously coded landscape dotted with minarets, crescents and stars. It’s there that this doomsday fantasy reaches a frothing, hysterical climax and offers deliverance of a kind, once again with a savior right from a promised land called Hollywood.“Inferno” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for gun and bomb violence.

The cinematography isn’t the greatest, and the structure is hit or miss, but so what? In a movie this good natured, the heart is everything.The performances are hilarious, but the dancing is no joke. As Gia Kourlas, a dance critic for The New York Times, points out, it takes exceptionally strong technique to merge classical choreography and comedy. Achieving what James Whiteside, a principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, calls “a balance between high art and clever camp” requires endless rehearsal and often physical therapy. Hoisting a 150-lb. man aloft is not for the weak-kneed.Born from the dust of the Stonewall riots in the 1970s (the name is a homage to the legendary Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo), the company was initially blackballed by financiers and quickly learned to survive on a budget. Leading us lightly through that history, the artistic director and the movie’s unofficial narrator, Tory Dobrin, describes the devastation of AIDS and the relief of creating a space where dancers could forge their own identities. Giving the middle finger to classical ballet was just gravy.Filming for four years, Ms. Hart follows a handful of touching individual stories and takes us on the road (the Trocks, as they are known, are rock stars in Japan), a punishing travel schedule that gobbles up more than two-thirds of the year. Oxygenating almost every scene, though, is the men’s delight in being liberated from the gender restrictions of traditional ballet — a freedom that allows them to create art that’s uniquely their own.",0,4809.0,,0

Happens all the time, right? But in “Underwater Dreams,” the teenagers are Latinos — and illegal immigrants, four of the many who could gain citizenship through the Dream Act — from a low-income high school in Arizona. They win against many colleges, including M.I.T., in a robotics challenge. And their unlikely achievement, in 2004, reverberates a decade later, helping the students who followed them at Carl Hayden Community High School to have more confidence and even, in some cases, propelling them to work as engineers and as leaders in Dreamer groups.The first half of the good-natured film introduces the Carl Hayden boys — the likable Oscar, Lorenzo, Luis and Cristian — and their teachers, allowing them to tell how Stinky (their robot) was built for the Marine Advanced Technology Education competition at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The team’s Spanish-speaking parents are interviewed, as are members of that losing M.I.T. robotics team.The second half tells the aftermath of that victory. A 2014 scene has the team again meeting with the M.I.T. students, who are all having fine careers in science and engineering; of the Carl Hayden graduates, only one has completed college.Modest yet meaningful, “Underwater Dreams” has a political point of view, shining light on underground Americans who deserve recognition. One of the aftermath scenes has some Carl Hayden graduates, now activists, stopping a bus filled with immigrants who are being returned to Mexico; a contrasting image from this month, of anti-immigration protesters stopping a bus of new arrivals in Murrieta, Calif., starkly reinforces this film’s contribution to a continuing dialogue.",0,,,1

A stalled truck forces the two to take the subway, at which time their city is subject to a very gnarly alien attack.The prospect of a hybrid of “Battle: Los Angeles” (2011) and Andrzev Wajda’s “Kanal” (1956) is not necessarily displeasing, but as it happens, “Beyond Skyline,” written and directed by Liam O’Donnell, is much, much more. (Among other things, it’s a kind of sequel to the 2010 film “Skyline,” for which Mr. O’Donnell was one of the two screenwriters, retaining its aliens but jettisoning its characters.)Fleeing the invaders via subway tunnels doesn’t work, so soon Mark, Trent and a few stock types are in an alien ship, besieged by fearsome creatures with tentacles that unscrew the tops of human heads. One of the captives is a blind Vietnam vet, which is interesting, because eventually the alien ship crashes in Laos, right on the Mekong River, where Mark must protect the newborn he delivered on the ship. (Long story.) The movie, which lists several Asian companies as co-producers, then morphs into a sci-fi martial arts picture, featuring a scene in which a woman lures a giant alien beast into a minefield.Whether you find this as much fun to watch as it is to describe will depend on your tolerance for clichés in dialogue (“I’m so sorry your family is gone. But killing yourself … is not gonna change that”), music (lots of string sections syncopating in high register) and much else. Also in how credible you find Mr. Grillo as an action star. I remain “meh” on him, but I did admire this movie’s near-lunatic genre-hopping.",0,,,1

It was an intensity in part born of his passionately felt engagement with history as a Jew, which took him from Stanford Medical School  in the 1940s to button-down respectability in the  1950s and,  thereafter, on the road and into the blue yonder with a devoted wife, nine children, a succession of battered campers and the surfboards that were by turns the family’s cradles,  playpens, lifelines and shields.You meet Mr. Paskowitz, or Doc,  straight away in the documentary “Surfwise,” Doug Pray’s wonderfully engaging look at love and family and the relentless pursuit of happiness, personal meaning and perfect waves. At least half the battle in the documentary is finding a worthy subject,  and few live up to their screen time as easily as Doc, a born pitchman, part carny, part evangelical, who even in his 80s continues to spread the Paskowitz gospel (clean living, clean surfing) with fervor. It’s Doc who revs up the story, opening the family’s book of life while doing unclothed calisthenics in front of Mr. Pray’s hovering camera. As he shares his philosophy and leathery skin, Doc doesn’t earn your attention — he commands it.Mr. Pray, a filmmaker with a thing for youth subcultures (his earlier films include “Hype!,” about the Seattle  music scene), has an easygoing, accessible, silky-smooth style. Working with a tight team — Dave  Homcy shot the movie on digital, and Lasse Jarvi edited it — he makes documentary filmmaking of this sort look deceptively easy. It isn’t, though you wouldn’t know it from how seamlessly he and his team integrate the talking-head interviews (the speakers helpfully identified); the locations (California, Hawaii, Israel); home movies; and news clips. Mr. Pray throws so many images and so much information at you — people and places, anecdotes and grudges — you may not immediately notice that all this groovy material has been marshaled into a very neat and conventional structure.That’s less a complaint than an observation. “Surfwise” has a bohemian vibe and a cool sheen, but it’s an eager-to-please, pleasing commercial enterprise with a reassuring narrative arc (happy, sad, happy). Once Doc’s origin story has been told (the movie says he introduced surfing to Israel),   the story moves into its most fascinating phase, namely that stretch in the 1960s and ’70s when he and his wife, Juliette, a Mexican-American looker with an  apparently sturdy constitution, raised, with next to no money, eight boys and one girl — David, Jonathan, Abraham, Israel, Moses, Adam, Salvador Daniel, Navah and Joshua — in a 24-foot camper. A few family members repeat the number 24 as if they still can’t believe it; I’m more wowed by the number 9.Doc, one of his sons explains with a mirthless laugh, was trying to repopulate the world with Jews. Certainly Doc’s sense of himself as a Jew who had escaped the Holocaust only by an accident of birth, by growing up in Southern California, hit him hard and kept hitting him. After two unhappy marriages and an unsatisfying professional  stint in Hawaii, where he had settled after Stanford, Doc shed his worldly belongings and old ways, discovered the joys of sex (he’s hilariously ribald on the specifics of that joy) and dedicated himself to uncompromised, uncompromising freedom, embracing the road like Jack Kerouac, one difference being that this dharma bum had a ready-made commune. He fled the greater world, creating a smaller, manageable one in its place.For a time, the world Doc made fit neatly into that 24-foot camper. Nut brown and slender, the Paskowitz children were beautiful, ideal subjects for an exhilarating, persuasively liberating experiment. But they were also somewhat like lab rats, given to little nips that, in time, as childish energy morphed into adolescent aggression, evolved into violence bordering on the pathological. “I loved supporting the Reich,” says David, the eldest son, who became the captain in an increasingly authoritarian regime. David’s choice of words is pretty startling, particularly given that this is an observant Jewish family. But Mr. Pray, who tends to glide rather than dig, doesn’t root around in Doc’s psychology or the family’s hurt. He pauses and then he moves on.From the on-screen evidence and from all those talking Paskowitz heads, it appears that the family mostly moved on too. That, at least, is the story that both they and Mr. Pray have chosen to tell. It’s a good, generally warming  story, one that made me want to grab a surfboard or at least check out the family’s famous surf camp in San Diego, which, as it happens, was attended by  Tommy Means,  who along with Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, and    Jonathan Paskowitz, helped produce the movie.  That further explains its clubby feel and perhaps Mr. Pray’s reluctance to push hard. The family that surfs together, it seems, stays together, in poverty and success, wipeouts and comebacks alike.“Surfwise” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

SCOTT,"Review: ‘The Beguiled,’ Sofia Coppola’s Civil War Cocoon","“The Beguiled,” Sofia Coppola’s new film, looks like a historical drama — it’s set in Virginia during the Civil War — but it often behaves more like a fairy tale. In the first scenes, a young girl ventures out into the woods to collect mushrooms and finds a strange man under a tree: a Union soldier with a badly wounded leg and a charming Irish brogue. Is he a prince or an ogre? (He’s Colin Farrell, which may or may not clarify the issue.)That is only one of the questions that hover in the humid, crepuscular air. The soldier, Cpl. John McBurney by name, finds himself convalescing in a plantation house, formerly a girls’ boarding school, occupied by his rescuer, Miss Amy (Oona Laurence) and her teachers and classmates. The matriarch of the group — there are six of them in all — is Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), who occupies an intriguing middle ground between fairy godmother and wicked stepmother, a zone that is familiar real estate for Ms. Kidman.Is McBurney a prisoner or a guest? Is he a threat to his hosts or is it the other way around? Who is beguiling whom? Ms. Coppola approaches these matters with her signature mix of intensity and detachment. Decorum is observed — grace is said before meals; corsets are tightened; French verbs are conjugated; everyone is called “miss” — but under the surface all kinds of strong emotions seethe and simmer. Even at midday the place has a gloomy, twilight quality. (The cinematographer is Philippe Le Sourd.) Mist and cannon smoke from a distant battlefield hang amid the Spanish moss. The atmosphere is too genteel to be gothic, but it is haunted nonetheless, by intimations of disorder, lust and violence.“Nous sommes des filles” the girls recite during their lessons, and “The Beguiled,” which remakes and revises Don Siegel’s 1971 film (with Clint Eastwood in Mr. Farrell’s role), is in part an essay on the nuances and paradoxes of femininity. It’s also the portrait of a group of ladies sorted by type and temperament. Miss Amy is sharp-witted and intellectually curious. Miss Jane (Angourie Rice), the princess of the group, is imperious and judgmental. Miss Emily (Emma Howard) is openhearted and obliging. Miss Alicia (Elle Fanning) is sullen and sneaky. Miss Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) applies herself to her duties with an air of disappointment. They find themselves competing for McBurney’s favor as he sets about manipulating their vanities and insecurities, smiling like a tomcat who has stumbled into a cage full of canaries.Like many of the characters in Ms. Coppola’s other films, Miss Martha and her charges dwell in a realm apart from the ordinary world, a gilded bubble that is both cocoon and prison. Some of this is a matter of circumstance. Versailles in “Marie Antoinette,” the Chateau Marmont hotel in “Somewhere,” the Tokyo Hyatt in “Lost in Translation” and suburbia in “The Virgin Suicides” and “The Bling Ring” — all of these are environments designed to quarantine their privileged residents from the disorder and misery of life.But Ms. Coppola also chooses to emphasize this removal, to narrow the perspective of her films by turning her gaze away from certain complications. In the case of “The Beguiled” this means that the war and its causes are banished to the margins. Occasionally a Confederate officer will show up at the gate, and the military situation sometimes arises in conversation, but the conflict is more a premise than a subject. It could be a natural disaster or a zombie-movie epidemic — a background event that provides atmosphere and structure rather than meaning.For this reason, “The Beguiled” has generated some controversy, in particular for omitting all but the most cursory mention of slavery. While this doesn’t strike me as an unfair criticism — as Corey Atad points out in Slate, an onscreen note explaining that “the slaves left” carries understatement to the point of historical irresponsibility — it also risks applying a standard that may not be entirely relevant to Ms. Coppola’s concerns.I say “may not” because her intentions are somewhat opaque. This “Beguiled” (based, like the Siegel-Eastwood version, on Thomas Cullinan’s novel) is a study in moods and implications, picking up difficult, volatile themes and then carefully putting them down again. The earlier film is a bracingly pulpy product of its moment, a time when American movies were breaking free of repressive codes and reveling — sometimes wallowing — in sexual display and rough violence. It’s smutty and disturbing and feverish, rooting around in the muck of the unconscious and the mess of the American past and digging up all kinds of disturbing stuff.None of that applies to Ms. Coppola’s film, which is less interested in battling repression than in observing its mechanisms and arguing, quietly and unmistakably, for its virtues. Her “Beguiled” is less a hothouse flower than a bonsai garden, a work of cool, exquisite artifice that evokes wildness on a small, controlled scale.I have called the film a fairy tale but you could also describe it as a horror movie, a quasi-western and a revenge melodrama, perhaps too many things at once. Most effectively, though — and largely thanks to Ms. Kidman’s regal, witty performance — it’s a comedy, a country-house farce about the problems caused by an inconvenient guest.",0,10542504.0,10576669.0,1

O. SCOTT,Objectification Is Also in the Eye of the Beheld,"Sexuality can be a puzzle — just ask Carl Jung, the kinky and conflicted psychoanalyst played by Michael Fassbender in “A Dangerous Method,” or Brandon, the sex addict played by Michael Fassbender in “Shame.” Or, if you insist on exploring the complexities of eros in a new movie not starring Mr. Fassbender, you might check out “Sleeping Beauty,” Julia Leigh’s sly and elusive film, which is itself something of a puzzle.Lucy (Emily Browning) is a broke and bored Australian university student scraping by in the usual unromantic ways: collating copies in a dreary office, scrubbing down tables at a cheap restaurant, offering herself as an occasional research subject in a science lab. But then, after responding to a classified ad in a free campus newspaper, she is recruited into a world of lucrative and highly specialized sex work.In outline, this might sound like either a grim cautionary tale or a prurient adventure in exploitation. And “Sleeping Beauty” does now and then take note of the bleak and lonely aspects of Lucy’s circumstances. Much more often, the camera lingers over Ms. Browning’s unclothed form, inviting the viewer’s eye to survey every inch of her milky and unblemished skin. There is a measure of soft-core titillation in this, for sure, but Ms. Leigh observes Lucy’s body and what happens to it with a dreamy detachment that is seductive and unnerving in equal measure. As well as a little ridiculous. Though the tone is quiet and the pacing serenely unhurried, “Sleeping Beauty” is at times almost screamingly funny, a pointed, deadpan surrealist sex farce that Luis Buñuel might have admired.After an arch interview with an icy, aristocratic blonde named Clara (Rachael Blake), Lucy is given a job that combines lingerie modeling and catering. Decked out in a brassiere, stockings, heels and garters — and with explicit instructions about the color of her lipstick — she pours wine at a geriatric dinner party, while other women, with darker hair, heavier makeup and more revealing outfits, dish out quail and caviar.Afterward, Lucy serves brandy from a crystal decanter while her co-workers arrange themselves like human furniture for the guests. This tableau of absolute possession — in which elderly, wealthy men surround themselves with compliant, silent, mostly naked and much younger women — is less predatory than pathetic, as if Ms. Leigh were rolling her eyes at the portentous, unsmiling eroticism on display at the parties in “Eyes Wide Shut.”Then Lucy is promoted. Clara ritualistically prepares some kind of narcotic tea, and as Lucy slumbers in an elegantly appointed bedroom she is visited by men we recognize from the earlier soirees. The rules of the establishment forbid intercourse, but this hardly lessens the feeling of menace and potential violation.The clients, however, do not seem to want to recapture their sexual potency as much as to mourn its loss. Lucy’s blank, smooth, passive body is a screen on which they project their desires, and Ms. Browning’s otherworldly face, with its wide eyes and heavy lips, conveys mystery and multiplicity. She is a living anthology of female archetypes: ingénue, femme fatale, girl gone wild, whatever the customer wants.Ms. Browning was similarly fetishized in Zack Snyder’s grim, salacious “Sucker Punch.” But Ms. Leigh, an Australian novelist directing her first film, pays particular attention to the gap between Lucy’s status as an object of lust and the state of her own longing. It’s the difference between an idealized (or abject) vision of femininity and an ordinary young woman.“My vagina is not a temple” she says to Clara, who had suggested otherwise, and there is nothing magical or sacred in the way Lucy approaches her sexuality. She allows herself to be picked up by strange men in bars, is generally passive and occasionally reckless, and reserves her expressions of affection and deep emotion for her tragic, sexless, literary friend, Birdmann (Ewen Leslie).At a certain point Lucy wants to find out what happens while she is under the spell of Clara’s potion, and she buys a small video camera for the purpose. We already know, of course, but the gap between our perception and Lucy’s emphasizes the film’s deeper secret — or perhaps its most effective tease — which is what goes on in her mind.SLEEPING BEAUTYOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Julia Leigh; director of photography, Geoffrey Simpson; edited by Nick Meyers; music by Ben Frost; production design by Annie Beauchamp; costumes by Shareen Beringer; produced by Jessica Brentnall; released by IFC Films.

O. SCOTT,"Review: Pixar’s ‘Inside Out’ Finds the Joy in Sadness, and Vice Versa","Can movies think? This is a longstanding critical question, usually answered in the negative. Literature, the thinking goes, is uniquely able to show us the flow of thought and feeling from within, but the camera’s eye and the two-dimensional screen can’t take us past the external signs of consciousness. We can look at faces in various configurations of pleasure or distress, but minds remain invisible, mysterious, beyond the reach of cinema.One of the many accomplishments of “Inside Out” — a thrilling return to form for Pixar Animation Studios after a few years of commercially successful submasterpieces — is that it demolishes this assumption. The movie, directed by Pete Docter, solves a thorny philosophical problem with the characteristically Pixaresque tools of whimsy, sincerity and ingenious literal-mindedness.The story takes place mostly in the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), who has just moved with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) from Minnesota to San Francisco. What happens to Riley on the outside is pretty standard: a dinner-table argument with Mom and Dad; a rough day at school; a disappointing hockey tryout. But anyone who has been or known a child Riley’s age will understand that such mundane happenings can be the stuff of major interior drama.The real action — the art, the comedy, the music and the poetry — unfolds among Riley’s personified feelings. There is an old literary tradition of turning what used to be called the Passions into characters, and “Inside Out” updates this tradition with brilliant casting. Riley’s brain is controlled by five busy, contentious emotions: Fear, Anger, Disgust, Sadness and Joy. Each one has a necessary role to play, and they all carry out their duties in Riley’s neurological command center with the bickering bonhomie of workplace sitcom colleagues.Their voices, aptly enough, belong to a television-comedy dream team. Anger, a squat, inverted trapezoid of bright red bluster, is the “Daily Show” ranter Lewis Black. Disgust, a green mean girl, is the great Mindy Kaling. Fear, an elastic-limbed goofball, is the former “Saturday Night Live” rubber man Bill Hader. Sadness speaks in the sighing monotone of Phyllis Smith, the most reliable killjoy on “The Office.” She is blue and slow-moving, and the others sometimes wonder what exactly her job is supposed to be.But Joy reigns supreme. Even without an organizational chart, you can tell she’s the boss. She’s a sparkling whirlwind of positive energy and friendly micro-management. You might say she’s the Leslie Knope of the cerebral cortex, and not only because her peppy vocalizations belong to Amy Poehler.In her long run as Leslie on “Parks and Recreation,” Ms. Poehler was frequently and hilariously annoying without ever ceasing to be likable. She performs a similar feat here, to a wonderfully subversive end. We start out rooting for Joy, primed by the Disney logo before the opening titles and the presence of young children in the neighboring seats. We want them — and Riley, and everyone — to be happy.But the insistence on happiness has its discontents. As a manager, Joy is focused above all on controlling and containing Sadness. She thinks she needs to keep her gloomy co-worker’s hands off Riley’s core memories. These golden, shiny orbs will be ruined if they turn blue. At one point, Joy draws a small chalk circle on the floor and instructs Sadness to stand inside it, not touching anything lest she wreck the upbeat mood.That’s a pretty powerful metaphor for repression, of course, and “Inside Out” turns a critical eye on the way the duty to be cheerful is imposed on children, by well-intentioned adults and by the psychological mechanisms those grown-up authorities help to install. “Where’s my happy girl?” Riley’s parents are fond of saying when she seems down, and the forced smile that results is quietly heartbreaking. Not that Riley’s mother and father are bad people. We see that their own heads are just as crowded as hers. They also have their own external worries and stresses, including a new house, a fledgling business and a child on the brink of momentous changes.Those unfold in a mental landscape that ranks among Pixar’s grandest visual triumphs, up there with the coral reef in “Finding Nemo,” the post-apocalyptic garbage dump in “Wall-E” and the sinister day care center in “Toy Story 3.” The studio’s earlier features have often served as demonstrations of technical breakthroughs. Pixar animators conquered water and piscine movement in “Nemo,” metal in “Cars,” fur in “Monsters, Inc.” and flight in “Up.”The achievement of “Inside Out” is at once subtler and more impressive. This is a movie almost entirely populated by abstract concepts moving through theoretical space. This world is both radically new — you’ve never seen anything like it — and instantly recognizable, as familiar aspects of consciousness are given shape and voice. Remember your imaginary childhood friend? Your earliest phobias? Your strangest dreams? You will, and you will also have a newly inspired understanding of how and why you remember those things. You will look at the screen and know yourself.I would gladly catalog the movie’s wittiest inventions and sharpest insights, or try to draw a word map of Riley’s brain. Nothing would be spoiled. But I’ll leave you the pleasure of discovery, noting only that you should keep an ear out for Michael Giacchino’s music and Richard Kind’s voice, and your eye peeled for sly philosophical sight gags.“Inside Out” is an absolute delight — funny and charming, fast-moving and full of surprises. It is also a defense of sorrow, an argument for the necessity of melancholy dressed in the bright colors of entertainment. The youngest viewers will have a blast, while those older than Riley are likely to find themselves in tears. Not of grief, but of gratitude and recognition. Sadness, it turns out, is not Joy’s rival but her partner. Our ability to feel sad is what stirs compassion in others and empathy in ourselves. There is no growth without loss, and no art without longing.“Inside Out” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Young children may be mildly alarmed in places, especially at the sight of their parents weeping through the last 20 minutes.",1,264317903.0,353852556.0,1

Yes, child trafficking is horrific; but embedding your raise-the-alarm mission in a film this inept runs the risk of arousing more amusement than activism.Unfolding on the back streets of Siem Reap, Cambodia, the story (by Christopher Bessette, who also directs) follows a sting operation run by Alex, a clench-jawed investigator (Dermot Mulroney). While Alex stalks an oily pimp and a shifty-eyed American pervert, his wife (Mira Sorvino, wan and weepy) volunteers at a shelter for rescued girls. Neither has come to terms with the loss of a daughter who died years earlier, a tidbit that, coupled with Alex’s unprofessional behavior, suggests damaged adults may not be the best saviors of endangered children.Creakily filmed and woodenly acted, “Trade of Innocents” is an agenda-driven drama (Ms. Sorvino serves as a United Nations good-will ambassador for combating human trafficking) that spells everything out in flowery, moralistic speeches. Mr. Bessette can hardly be faulted for his intentions, but his vision might have been clearer had he stepped down from his soapbox.“Trade of Innocents” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

But there’s barely a whiz-bang punch line or smoothly executed setup to be found in a movie that longs to be a sparkling bedroom comedy and winds up a tortured, fizz-free farce.And no one is more tormented than Owen Wilson, who plays a hooker-loving Broadway director named Arnold with a puppyish haplessness that’s completely wrong for a character who is so clearly a jerk. Arnold is on a mission to get working girls off their backs and into respectable careers, doling out generous seed money — after, of course, he has thoroughly accepted their gratitude.His latest save is Izzy (the British actress Imogen Poots, chewing strenuously on alien Brooklyn vowels), a wide-eyed tootsie and ground zero for the film’s romantic bedlam. Everyone, it seems, is dizzy for Izzy: The geeky playwright (Will Forte) who unwittingly auditions her for a role in Arnold’s next project; a pathetic former client (Austin Pendleton) who tails her obsessively. Even Arnold’s caustic wife (Kathryn Hahn), the star of the play and the onetime lover of her torch-carrying co-star (Rhys Ifans, hardly anyone’s idea of a tasty bit on the side), can’t wait to bring Izzy on board.Unfolding in flashback as Izzy recounts her streets-to-stardom rise for a jaded journalist (an eye-rolling Illeana Douglas), “She’s Funny That Way” marks the first feature from Peter Bogdanovich in more than a dozen years. But the sizzling energy he brought to “What’s Up, Doc?” (1972) is missing here, as is the touching authenticity of “The Thing Called Love” (1993). Choking on nostalgia and forced connections, the dusty screenplay (by Mr. Bogdanovich and his former wife, Louise Stratten) leans much too heavily on pop-up celebrities who spit bread crumbs of dialogue and then disappear.Carelessly framed and halfheartedly lighted, the actors strain to accommodate unfamiliar screwball rhythms and an abundance of screaming and slapping. Rising above both are the prodigiously talented Lucy Punch, as an Eastern European call girl trying to service the wrong john, and Jennifer Aniston — proving once again that tartness is her friend — playing a tough-love therapist with a blithe disregard for emotional filters and professional ethics.But a few good women and a handful of amusing lines are far less than we expect from such an intelligent, resourceful filmmaker. “I believe in happy endings,” Izzy says at the beginning of the film, and so does Mr. Bogdanovich. This time, though, the audience will just be happy to see him fashion any kind of ending at all. Rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"In a Grim, Mysterious World, a Burlap Hero With a Heart of Golden Fuzz","9, who is about the size and shape of one of those posable tabletop mannequins used by art students, has a soft burlap body and a zipper up his middle. His outsize eyes blink like camera shutters, and they take in a world of monstrous terror and haunting mystery.In the 10-minute version of the animated film that bears his name, 9 and his comrades — who I suppose should be called robots, though they are softer and rounder than the contraptions usually evoked by that word — navigate their surroundings without speech. Now, at feature length, the main character’s muteness is a temporary impediment, and he finds himself surrounded by eight other numbered automatons,  introduced out of order like a row of Sudoku. (The numerologically inclined will note that the film’s opening date is 9/9/09). Some of these figures speak in the polished tones of well-known actors, including John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly and Crispin Glover.Once 2 (Martin Landau) gives him a tuneup, 9 begins asking questions in the voice of Elijah Wood. And one of the virtues of this “9,” as of its shorter predecessor (both were directed by Shane Acker, who wrote the feature with Pamela Pettler) is that it does not rush toward answers. Instead it lingers in a strange, sinister and brilliantly realized landscape rich with allusions to the histories of painting, animation, fantastic literature and 20th-century totalitarianism.It’s a lot to stuff into 88 minutes, along with rattling monsters, hectic battle sequences and a series of debates between 9 and 1 (Christopher Plummer) about the proper response to danger. (1 wants to remain safe, hidden and ignorant, while 9 wants to fight, explore and learn. You can guess who prevails). But even though it grows a little busy at times and concludes with an unfortunate and unconvincing foray into mystico-spiritual mumbo jumbo, “9” shows remarkable imagination and visual integrity.Combining two well-worn, endlessly fertile science fiction conceits — the postapocalyptic planet and the sensitive machine — Mr. Acker has made a parable of technological peril that is both exciting and satisfyingly enigmatic. Though he uses the latest computer-assisted techniques, his aesthetic has a pleasingly creaky, handmade feel, as if his main tools were not a mouse and a keyboard but rather a needle and thread.The evil machines ranged against the soft-bodied robots resemble collaborations between Rube Goldberg and Hieronymus Bosch. They are demonic things with glowing eyes and ferocious appetites. The motive for their murderous zeal is one of the puzzles that 9, in the midst of struggling for survival, must try to solve.This movie’s affinity with “Wall-E,” another fable of a soulful machine in a blighted, depopulated milieu, is clear enough, though “9” never achieves that film’s lyrical sublimity. Some of Mr. Acker’s influences are easy to spot, from experimental animators like Jan Svankmajer and the Brothers Quay to Tim Burton, a producer of “9.” Its look is smoky, dusty and vaguely European, and its gadgets have an analog solidity that suggests the futuristic nightmares of a long-ago time.9 and his brethren, scuttling through bombed-out buildings like partisans in an occupied city, evading predatory bird- and spiderlike  foes and quarreling among themselves, also try to piece together their own history. Their inquiry is both metaphysical — who made them, and why? — and practical: what are they made of, and how does it work? Answers are parceled out in quieter moments and in vivid rushes of imagery that punctuate the fights and flights.The action is breathless and intense, the ravenous villains are frightening to behold, and the overall mood is probably too dark and anxious for very young children. But every effort to expand the range of feature-length animation beyond the confines of cautious family fare is to be welcomed, and budding techno and fantasy geeks are likely to be intrigued and enthralled.“9” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scary scenes of danger and destruction.9Opens on Wednesday nationwide.Directed by Shane Acker; written by Pamela Pettler, based on a story by Mr. Acker; animation director, Joe Ksander; director of photography, Kevin R.

Unlike the majority of movie criminals, Joe suffers self-pitying pangs of conscience about an occupation that provides him with a modest living. When forced to take care of his uncontrollable 20-year-old son, who has Down syndrome and has just been ejected from the institution where he has spent the last 12 years, Joe grouses that it is “payback for what I do.”Joe Jr., convincingly played by Tom Guiry, is an unmanageable handful who acts out every impulse.  Resentful of his father for ignoring him during a hospitalization that began when his mother abandoned the family, he lashes out in wild-animal tantrums whenever he is thwarted.As “Yonkers Joe,” written and directed by Robert Celestino, gathers momentum, it becomes an unwieldy if absorbing hybrid of incompatible movies.  One is a diabolical David Mamet caper comedy in which Joe engineers a score that will give him the means to place Joe Jr. in a fancy hospital. The other is an inspirational family drama heavily indebted to “Rain Man,” a film in which gambling also figured  prominently.With its behind-the-scenes view of a seedy criminal enterprise in which we observe the preparation of loaded dice and the sly, conspiratorial glances shared by Joe and his crew as they fleece naïve gamblers in backrooms and at a clambake, “Yonkers Joe” is far more persuasive in its ersatz-Mamet mode than as a tear-jerker. The petty crook Joe is one of the meatiest roles of Mr. Palminteri’s career.Like Joe Mantegna, a Mamet regular, Mr. Palminteri has larceny written all over his dark, stormy features. Joe’s portly right-hand man, Stanley (Michael Lerner), is also out of Mamet, serving as the movie’s answer to Ricky Jay.But as a teary melodrama in which Joe seeks to give his son a measure of self-esteem by enlisting his help at a Las Vegas crap game, the movie turns into mawkish drivel. Like so many embattled-father-son movies, “Yonkers Joe” congratulates itself by imagining that a hug and an endearment will confer instant redemption after years of neglect.Joe has a long-term relationship with Janice (Christine Lahti), a sometime partner in the con game. If Janice, with her shiny wardrobe, silver-polished nails and tacky jewelry, looks credibly tawdry, Ms. Lahti’s innate demureness undercuts the brass. Especially in her scenes with Joe Jr. the tough, street-hardened edge in her voice softens into the indulgent coo of an upscale suburban mom.Janice shares Joe’s lurking self-disgust. In one outburst she describes herself as “a dumb Yonkers girl from Lincoln High” and laments that she is old and ugly, although she is neither.As Joe and his crew set out for Las Vegas to bilk a pair of corrupt gamblers from Florida who have enlisted him to help them beat the house, the tensions among Joe, Joe Jr. and Janice, whose friendliness toward Joe Jr. he disastrously misinterprets as attraction, are stretched to the breaking point.For all its attention to detail, “Yonkers Joe” isn’t half as tough as it pretends to be. The real story of these bottom-feeders and the sad young man they exploit is a lot uglier than the movie even begins to let on.“Yonkers Joe” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The high point of those opening minutes is a fantastically gaudy fake trailer for a sequel, “Machete Kills Again ... In Space,” which embodies the director Robert Rodriguez’s nostalgia for trashy B-movie exploitation flicks. All too soon, “Machete Kills” collapses into a deranged, directionless splatter comedy that exhausts its bag of tricks, many of them recycled from this grindhouse auteur’s 2010 spoof, “Machete.” Even the cleverest new toy, a weapon that turns bodies inside out, is so unimaginatively deployed that it’s good for a yawn. Once again, Danny Trejo — the monosyllabic, stone-faced 69-year-old actor who resembles a craggier, pint-size younger cousin of Willie Nelson — is the absurdly indestructible title character. Here he is enlisted by the United States president (Charlie Sheen, credited by his real name, Carlos Estevez) to forestall catastrophe. The weaselly chief executive, who is shown being distracted in bed by several pliable babes who pass him the red phone from hand to hand, is not the sort of leader to inspire confidence. The threat comes from Mendez (Demian Bichir), a Mexican drug lord and revolutionary with multiple personality disorder and an explosive device implanted in his heart. Should anything happen to that organ, a nuclear missile will be triggered to wipe out Washington.It isn’t until the second half of the movie that we meet the bomb’s diabolical creator, Voz (Mel Gibson), a billionaire arms dealer intent on spreading chaos around the globe while he and his inner circle gleefully look down from outer space. From the moment Machete dons a spacesuit, the film turns into the sloppiest imitation of a James Bond movie ever made.“Machete” is stuffed with Mr. Rodriguez’s version of Bond girls, the most lethal being Desdemona (Sofia Vergara), the man-hating madam of a brothel, who, in revenge for her father’s abuse, feasted on his genitals and turned her breasts and crotch into lethal weapons. Amber Heard plays Machete’s duplicitous handler, a blond bombshell who wins the Miss San Antonio contest. Walton Goggins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Antonio Banderas and Lady Gaga all play the same shape-shifting assassin, who peels off a mask to reveal each new identity. With its desperate stunt casting, witless “Star Wars” allusions and bloat that suggests that Mr. Rodriguez got carried away, “Machete Kills” loses its mojo. It commits the unpardonable sin of being dull. “Machete Kills” is rated R (Under 17 requires an accompanying parent or adult guardian) for intense, bloody violence; strong language; and sexual content.",0,5658869.0,8008161.0,0

His method is a slow, careful formalism — so slow and so careful that his film can feel airless and overly aestheticized.Instead of a conventional plot, “Alms,” set during one day and night in the Punjab, in northwestern India, has situations. A villager’s house is destroyed by a rich landlord; striking rickshaw drivers hold a rally; a field worker complains about how her employers treat her; a man with a head wound tries to find some repose; gunshots are heard in the night.Mr. Singh’s sympathies are clearly with the dispossessed and the struggling. His film poses the question, voiced by one of the long-suffering villagers, “How can you challenge the mighty?” But this isn’t a rabble-rousing movie in which social wrongs are righted. It’s too muted and studied for that.Without a driving narrative, “Alms” must rely on its elegantly composed images, filmed in 35 millimeter. Mr. Singh poses villagers (the cast includes nonprofessionals) in sculptural groups and shoots them as a still photographer might. Or he pans down slowly while a woman speaks, to reveal her gently petting the head of a sick goat. Or he cuts to a tree where an owl perches in a hollowed-out shelter.Much of this is thoughtful and lovely, but it’s not particularly vital. Too oblique to work as a documentary-type portrait of a community, “Alms,” produced by the National Film Development Corporation in India, plays more like scenes from a village. It shows us unhurried bits of daily life and lived-in faces but remains firmly on the outside, carefully making its slow study.",0,,,1

Even when they try to drag it out of the earth with ropes and chains attached to a car, it refuses to budge.That old dead tree is an unwieldy metaphor for family solidarity in “Nothing Like the Holidays,” an efficient home-for-Christmas ensemble comedy trimmed with plastic teardrops. But the tree might also stand for a wooden holiday genre in which uplift follows tumult as surely as Christmas morning follows Christmas Eve. The only distinguishing characteristic of this mildly agreeable variation of a worn-out formula is that the boisterous family under examination is Puerto Rican, and the screenplay includes a smattering of Spanish.In its early scenes the movie, which has as many underdeveloped subplots as characters, threatens to be another melodrama about a returning soldier.  The glum Jesse (Freddy  Rodriguez), home from Iraq, is picked up at the airport by his neighborhood pals; sunglasses cover deep scratches around one eye that suggest he has had a set-to with a riled-up house cat.But “Nothing Like the Holidays,” directed by Alfredo de Villa (“Washington Heights”) from a screenplay by Alison Swan and Rick Najera, has neither the time nor the inclination to explore Jesse’s malaise in any depth. Although he harbors guilt about the death of a friend in combat, what really bugs him is that Marissa (Melonie Diaz), the girlfriend he dumped, has happily settled down with another man.No sooner has the Rodriguez clan gathered around the dinner table than the mother, Anna (Elizabeth Peña, who is at least a decade too young for her role), announces she is divorcing Eddy (Alfred Molina), her husband of 36 years, who owns a bodega; he allegedly cheated. The notion that a family-loving matriarch would make such a surprise announcement (even Eddy is ambushed) at a festive holiday reunion is simply bizarre.Dinner, of course, is ruined. The taciturn Eddy, who urges a reluctant Jesse, the younger of his two sons, to go into the family business, has his own secret torment. (Hint: It’s medical.)Anna, as written, is a disagreeable piece of work.  She badgers her non-Hispanic daughter-in-law, Sarah (Debra Messing), a yuppie banker, to give her a grandchild and mutters nasty things about her in Spanish, which Sarah can’t understand. The movie appears to take Anna’s side. Sarah is married to Anna’s oldest son, Mauricio (an unconvincing John Leguizamo in expensive eyewear), a successful lawyer.Also on hand is a daughter, Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito), a struggling television actress living in Hollywood who is waiting for a call from her agent about a part. Will Roxanna hook up with her hunky but shady childhood friend Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who carries a gun along with a potentially lethal grudge against a neighbor? Ms. Ferlito and Mr. Hernandez lend the movie a smidgen of heat.The most engaging moments of “Nothing Like the Holidays” are the festive party sequences in which the characters throw off their troubles to dance in the bodega and pour into the street in their Christmas finery. Their troubles momentarily forgotten, the residents of Humboldt Park really know how to enjoy themselves.“Nothing Like the Holidays” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a little violence and sexual situations.NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYSOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Alfredo de Villa; written by Rick Najera and Alison Swan; director of photography, Scott Kevan; edited by Amy E.

In Stephen Apkon and Andrew Young’s documentary, “Disturbing the Peace,” we meet Combatants for Peace, an advocacy-activist group comprising Israelis and Palestinians who have reached their limit and renounced violence. Most are former military or paramilitary personnel seeking a two-state solution to Israel’s agonized convulsions. Their stories are compelling — and persuasive.The movie doesn’t examine in detail Hamas’s attacks on Israel or the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, or even outline recent political developments. Rather, it briefly offers wrenching images (a bombing in Tel Aviv; razed Palestinian homes) before delving into the personal histories of members of Combatants for Peace. The transformations they describe are less like lightning bolts and more like dawning epiphanies.One member, Chen Alon, an Israeli Army veteran, denied clearance at a checkpoint to a Palestinian father desperate to deliver his sick children to a hospital. Mr. Alon, a father himself, realized Palestinians can be loving parents as well.Shifa al-Qudsi, a Palestinian, who lost teenage cousins and a sister-in-law in the conflict, planned to blow up a supermarket. Apprehended beforehand, she was imprisoned for six years. There she met a guard who lost a brother in a suicide attack, and Ms. al-Qudsi, too, recognized her adversary’s humanity.Combatants for Peace, formed in 2005, is dedicated to nonviolent demonstrations and dialogue. Outside a rally, its members endure savage insults from onlookers but are undaunted. “We can’t push you out of here and you can’t push us out, either,” Jamil Qassas, a Palestinian, says onstage. “We have to coexist with one another.”While much of Israel’s political establishment dismisses the group as a far-left organization, its members “see this as a long-distance run,” says Avner Wishnitzer, a founder. “And we will continue to go on with it.”",1,23688.0,,0

McLaughlin (screenplay), Stephen Rebello (book)",2012,6.8,66725.0,60.0,2017-11-02 04:18:16,MANOHLA DARGIS,A Knife and a Shower: Sounds Hitchcockian,"The credits for the new movie “Hitchcock” state that it is based on a book by Stephen Rebello. It isn’t, not really, though details and true stories from the book have been slipped into the mix amid amusing performances, historical re-creations and heavily perfumed fertilizer. The book, “Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ‘Psycho,’ ” is a fast, diverting read that, true to its title, tracks how the master of suspense, sometimes with surprising effort, made his influential, perverse shocker. “Hitchcock,” by contrast, is rather like Norman Bates, that nervous pretty boy with mommy issues and a bobbing Adam’s apple, in that it too takes extravagant liberties with the dead.It does so largely by doing what some disreputable Hitchcock biographical books have done: It reads him through his work, as if his movies were a direct reflection of his mind, soul and deepest, darkest desires. To that end, it is 1959 and Hitchcock — a fine Anthony Hopkins buried in a fat suit and under distracting facial prosthetics — is casting about for a new project. He’s just come off one of his greatest films, “North by Northwest,” which delighted the public and critics, a nice upturn after the disappointing reception of another of his supreme achievements, “Vertigo.” (In September, after five decades, “Vertigo” bumped “Citizen Kane” from the No. 1 spot in Sight and Sound’s critics’ poll of “the greatest films of all time.”)At the premiere of “North by Northwest” a reporter asks Hitchcock, “You’re the most famous director in the history of the medium, but you’re 60 years old, shouldn’t you just quit while you’re ahead?” Thus challenged Hitchcock searches for “something fresh, something different.” What he finds is “Psycho.” Written by Robert Bloch, the 1959 novel was inspired by the macabre crimes of Ed Gein, the Wisconsin serial killer who decorated his home with human body parts and can be blamed for legions of horror films, including “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.” (Gein liked to walk around wearing the skin and body parts of his female victims, behavior echoed in “The Silence of the Lambs,” in which Mr. Hopkins plays a serial killer who’s the ultimate sophisticate.)But Hitchcock isn’t simply taken with “Psycho,” he also becomes possessed by it. As he tries and sometimes struggles to make the movie (the studio isn’t keen on the material), the book and increasingly its inspiration take him over, disturbing his sleep and invading his dreams. At the same time he is having trouble with his wife, Alma (a crisp, overglammed Helen Mirren), who’s grown grievously unhappy with his fixation on the blondes who populate his work. She finds some refuge in a relationship with a sycophantic screenwriter, Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), whose hovering attention contrasts sharply with Hitchcock’s standoffishness. Hitchcock, though, is apparently a much smaller man without Alma, who is at once his adviser, crutch and cinematic savior.The fantasy vision of Alma and Hitchcock’s marriage is one unfortunate element in a movie that doesn’t merely give creative genius a bad name, but also pathologizes it. Fearlessly unsubtle, the director Sacha Gervasi, working from John J. McLaughlin’s script, crams the production with bird imagery and shows Hitchcock sneaking peeks at a blonde in a tight gray suit, a proxy for Kim Novak’s character in “Vertigo.” The filmmakers even bring Gein (Michael Wincott) into the picture, so that he can loom and lurk in the shadows of Hitchcock’s imagination. Hitchcock, you are meant to believe, was himself a little psycho and could only work from a place of madness. His stash of glamour shots of his blondes are the equivalent of Gein’s grisly human trophies.The real Hitchcock’s great flaw, apparently, was that he was at once a genius and a private man, a combination that has allowed some writers and filmmakers to have their insultingly imaginative way with him. The recent HBO exploitation flick, “The Girl,” for instance, about his relationship with the actress Tippi Hedren, painted him as a pathetic sexual predator. (Ms. Hedren has called him deviant and evil.) Although it tiptoes on the dark side, “Hitchcock” takes a lighter, more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director. The movie has its diversions, including Scarlett Johansson’s bodacious Janet Leigh and Michael Stuhlbarg’s wheedling Lew Wasserman. It’s fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly, they also smack of spiteful jealousy.“Hitchcock” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

But if you’re looking for an uncomfortably authentic drama about the horrors of dedicated drug use, then this strange little number from Jason Banker (who also wrote the screenplay and wielded the camera) might just do the trick.Playing out in a series of woozily wandering scenes, the nonlinear story coalesces around James (James Davidson), a rudderless young man whose life is a succession of drug-fueled parties. Whether falling-down drunk or messed up on mushrooms, James and his friends are a tiresome tribe of slackers, whose unappetizing self-abuse is detailed with documentarylike precision. But when a beautiful college student named Sara (Sara Anne Jones) joins the group and begins an avid descent into substance-assisted experience, her fixation on a wooded road supposedly dotted with seven gateways to hell will drag James, and the plot, in a completely new and disturbing direction.Extrapolating from the actual lives of his nonprofessional actors (Ms. Jones died of a drug overdose shortly after the film’s 2012 festival debut), Mr. Banker teases us with a dizzy, dislocating shooting style that throws up a succession of eerily arresting images. Even so, his film never overcomes the fact that watching drugged-out wastrels is rarely interesting — unless, of course, you’re one of them.",0,,,0

SCOTT,"Review: ‘Mother!’ Is a Divine Comedy, Dressed as a Psychological Thriller","The couple live in a grand, oddly-shaped Victorian house in the middle of a tree-ringed meadow — less a McMansion than a perennial fixer-upper. The work of home improvement, of literal homemaking, you might say, falls to the young wife. Her husband, who has been around longer than she has, is absorbed in his work. He’s a poet, and the torment of creation distracts him from her needs, at times rendering him all but oblivious to her presence. Neither partner is given a name. They are played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. The movie is called “Mother!” The first line of dialogue is “Baby?”The missus walks around in her nightgown, lonely and confused, especially when her hubby starts bringing home guests. “Who are these people?” she asks him. She never receives an adequate answer — they are big fans of the poet’s work, though — and for a while her bewilderment is ours as well. But we, at least, are in a position to analyze the abundantly available clues and figure out who everybody is, the poet and his lady included. Or if not quite who they are, then at least what they represent. Because though this extravagant conversation piece of a movie, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, feints toward psychological thriller territory and spends a delicious half-hour or so in the realm of domestic farce, it plants its flag defiantly on the wind-swept peak of religious (and ecological) allegory.I don’t mean this in the vague, Superman-is-really-a-messiah-figure term paper sense of the word. At a certain point — it will vary according to your Sunday school attendance or what you remember from freshman English — you will find yourself in possession of the key to the analogical storage room where the Real Meaning resides. Up until that point, you might have thought this was a marital melodrama set in a nightmarish version of a ’50s academic marriage. When Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, you might mistake “Mother!” for a savage, scrambled “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” adaptation. But then, sometime between the first violent death and the collapse of the kitchen sink, you realize that something else is going on.Here I must confess a different kind of puzzlement. Is there such a thing as interpretive spoiler? Is it wrong to reveal a movie’s conceit, rather than elements of its story? Ordinarily, such questions would be absurd, but Mr. Aronofsky ingeniously braids his movie’s hermeneutic structure into its plot, making it hard to say what it’s about without revealing what happens. All of the suspense and most of the fun in “Mother!” — and don’t listen to anyone who natters on about how intense or disturbing it is; it’s a hoot! — has to do with the elaboration and execution of a central idea.Once you grasp that idea, you are left wondering just how far Mr. Aronofsky will go with it. The answer is all the way and then some — from Genesis to Revelation and back again. The house is referred to early in the film as “paradise”; Ms. Lawrence refers to a relatively minor mess as an “apocalypse.” These are more teasers than jokes, and the punch lines arrive with mesmerizing literalness. Holy Eucharist, Batman!Not that Mr. Aronofsky follows any known doctrinal path, any more than he did in “Noah,” which upset some believers by taking liberties with its scriptural source. “Mother!” casts a wider net, gathering influences from cinema — Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Gaspar Noé — from literature and, most strikingly, from painting. Mr. Aronofsky and his usual cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, conduct a master class in light, shadow and Renaissance art. Ms. Lawrence glows like an Italian Madonna, while the deep lines in Mr. Bardem’s face and the sorrowful cast of his eyes suggest El Greco. The infernal chaos of the climactic sequences are pure Hieronymus Bosch, updated for the age of Kristen Wiig and automatic weaponry.It falls to the actors to endow this highly symbolic, pictorially overloaded environment with a sense of human reality — with flesh and blood and feeling. Mr. Bardem, alpha male and omega man, is the kind of actor who can endow an abstraction with gravity and tenderness. (He did pretty much that in “No Country for Old Men.”) The enigmatic nature of his character in “Mother!” allows him to relax, to be playful and charismatic, and to disappear. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer bring a jolt of shtick and a whisper of camp, qualities that you may miss terribly when they depart.Ms. Lawrence, for her part, bears an impossible burden. In dramatic terms, she is a passive, reactive protagonist, a cipher and, in the strict sense of the word, an icon. Called upon to embody all of womankind — and a lot else besides — she is denied the chance to be human, and her blankness empties the film of emotional power.What it has, instead, is extravagant sensation and churning intellectual energy. Mr. Aronofsky is a virtuoso of mood and timing, a devoted student of form and technique straining to be a credible visionary. But as wild and provocative as his images can be, there is something missing — an element of strangeness, of difficulty, of the kind of inspiration that overrides mere cleverness.On the other hand, “Mother!” made me laugh harder and more frequently than just about any other movie I’ve seen this year. I don’t say this derisively. Mr. Aronofsky’s visual wit and dexterous, disciplined camera movements create frissons of comic terror. His gift for escalation — evident in the marvelous crescendo of frenzied action that occupies most of the movie’s second half — may be unmatched in his generation of filmmakers.It’s not clear that his gifts match his ambitions. He wants to be Kubrick, but maybe what we need is a new Blake Edwards. At a time when film comedy is mostly a verbal and psychical affair — the domain of writers and clowns — there is a dearth of funny directors with Mr. Aronofsky’s sophisticated chops. If he didn’t take himself so seriously, he could be a great comic filmmaker. But maybe “Mother!” proves that he already is.",0,17297289.0,17800004.0,0

Until I Don’t,’ Love and Loathing in Florida","The most valuable takeaway from “I Do ... Until I Don’t,” Lake Bell’s pained sex comedy, is that there’s a lot of money in happy endings. And not the kind that are typically tacked onto movies like this one.Rather, the massage-parlor treat promised here is an anniversary gift from Cybil (Mary Steenburgen) to her longtime husband, Harvey (Paul Reiser). But the giving is itself an act of such passive-aggressive loathing that it all but destroys any comedic potential in their relationship, never mind any desire we might have to see their union endure.In that we’re joined by Vivian (Dolly Wells), a bitter British filmmaker who believes marriage to be unsustainable. To prove her thesis, she has enlisted Cybil and Harvey plus two more fractured Florida couples for what she is pleased to call a documentary. Ms. Bell (who also wrote the preposterous script) and Ed Helms play an unhappily childless twosome who practice “results-based” sex by means of a phone app that tracks ovarian cycles. And Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac are hippie-dippie caricatures whose free-love philosophy is as much a sham as Vivian’s filmmaking ethics.Painted in the broadest possible strokes, these ropy relationships agitate a movie that has neither a coherent point nor an authentic character. There’s little evidence here of the talent that made Ms. Bell’s 2013 filmmaking debut, “In a World ...” (about struggling voice-over artists), as gentle and genuine as this one is abrasive and cartoonish. Hanging out with these folks is no fun; being married to some of them is unimaginable.",0,279263.0,,0

SCOTT,"Review: In ‘The Dressmaker,’ a Femme Fatale Wants Vengeance","“I’m back, you bastards.”“Is that Dior?”“Have you come about the opossum?”There are the opening lines uttered by the first three major characters encountered in “The Dressmaker,” Jocelyn Moorhouse’s adaptation of the novel by Rosalie Ham. An intriguing start, made even more so by the actors who are speaking: Kate Winslet, Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. Ms. Winslet, who says line one, is wearing the dress referred to line two. It’s not Dior, by the way, but it nonetheless effortlessly evokes a certain postwar femme fatale glamour, which is duly undermined by the opossum in line three.It’s the early 1950s, and Tilly Dunnage (Ms. Winslet) has returned to her dusty Australian hometown in search of vengeance. She moves in with her dotty mother, Molly (Ms. Davis), and promptly sets tongues wagging and bad memories stirring. As a child (then known as Myrtle), Tilly was bullied by a rich kid and blamed for his death. That supposed crime will be revisited, and the closets of this wicked little hamlet will disgorge their skeletons.Meanwhile, Tilly will put her sewing skills — acquired in Paris during her long exile — to work outfitting the local women with fashionable frocks. She will also catch the eye of a hunky fellow outcast (Liam Hemsworth) who lives in a trailer with his mother, his mentally challenged brother and a gaggle of other siblings. Ms. Moorhouse (whose previous films include “Proof” and “How to Make an American Quilt”) and her costume and production designers make the most of the period setting, and it’s fun to watch good actors play dress-up, especially Mr. Weaving, whose character is a cross-dressing constable.Unfortunately, and despite its promising start, “The Dressmaker” doesn’t move much beyond the level of well-costumed playacting. The tone shifts, abruptly and awkwardly, from jaunty comedy to dark, violent drama, and the plot is a pileup of incident and complication, with revelations withheld and bestowed almost capriciously. The contrast between Tilly’s taste and beauty and the townspeople’s nastiness is cartoonishly overdrawn, even as the cast members work valiantly to humanize their simplistic roles. They are worth watching, but the question you find yourself asking of Tilly — what on earth is she doing here? — applies equally to Ms. Winslet and her fellow troupers.“The Dressmaker” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Despite Mr. Bloch’s admitted lack of experience, the club quickly gained a reputation for musical democracy, nurturing artists as diverse as Blues Traveler and Ani DiFranco. Embracing everyone from Deadheads to ska enthusiasts, Mr. Bloch and his staff — whose hiring was more likely to hinge on knowledge of Jerry Garcia’s birthday than on bartending skills — espoused a commitment to populism that reached far beyond the music.Crammed with colorful interviews, digital animation and live performances, this frisky and forthright film by Dean Budnick chronicles a vision of financing social progress with really great tunes. Often holding close to triple its official capacity of 389 (not including the rats), the club provided a psychedelic haven where the straws were made of paper, the matches were recycled and the music often lasted until sunrise. The dream may have ended in 2001, done in by the remorseless march of gentrification and the Giuliani purification program, but the music and the memories live on.WETLANDS PRESERVEDOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Dean Budnick; director of photography, Jonathan Healey; edited by Mr. Healey; produced by Peter Shapiro and Mr. Budnick; released by First Run Features.

The name is an acronym for building, antenna, span, earth — the things that its practitioners jump from with parachutes.The film begins with vague but ominous recollections of Boenish’s worst jumping day — it was in 1984 — from people who knew him, a subject it returns to at the end, though to say more here would be a spoiler for those not familiar with his story. In between, it recreates how Boenish fostered the sport in its early days, filming jumps he and companions made off places like El Capitan, the imposing rock formation in Yosemite National Park. The contraption he made for himself to perch on so that he could film his buddies face-on as they ran off El Capitan in 1978 is terrifyingly audacious.The film, by Marah Strauch, is really the story of two people, Boenish and his wife, Jean Boenish, who jumped with him and here acts as a candid guide to his career and thought process. It ends with glorious footage of a wingsuit flier, a relatively recent variation of the BASE jumper, gliding through mountains like a bird.“He would be right there with the wingsuit fliers,” Jean Boenish says of her husband, “and in essence is.”The death last weekend of two men, including Dean Potter, a well-known extreme-sport enthusiast, in a wingsuit jump at Yosemite, just underscores that such romanticism has a price.“Sunshine Superman” is rated PG (Parents strongly cautioned).

Katniss, the lethally tough linchpin from Suzanne Collins’s trilogy and now a rather less imposing film heroine, is a teenage survivalist in a postapocalyptic take on a familiar American myth. When she runs through that forest, and even when she falls, there’s something of the American frontiersman in her, as if she were Natty Bumppo reborn and resexed.For as long as this brief scene lasts, it seems possible that Gary Ross, the unlikely and at times frustratingly ill-matched director for this brutal, unnerving story, has caught the heart-skipping pulse of Michael Mann’s “Last of the Mohicans” if not that film’s ravishing technique and propulsive energy. Alas, Mr. Ross, the director of the genial entertainments “Pleasantville” and “Seabiscuit,” and whose script credits include “Big,” has a way of smoothing even modestly irregular edges. Katniss, who for years has bagged game to keep her family from starving, was created for rough stuff — for beating the odds and the state, for hunting squirrel and people both — far rougher than Mr. Ross often seems comfortable with, perhaps because of disposition, inclination or some behind-the-scenes executive mandate.It may be that Mr. Ross is too nice a guy for a hard case like Katniss. A brilliant, possibly historic creation — stripped of sentimentality and psychosexual ornamentation, armed with Diana’s bow and a ferocious will — Katniss is a new female warrior, and she keeps you watching even while you’re hoping for something better the next time around. (Mr. Ross is onboard to direct the follow-up, “Catching Fire.”) For some fans of the three novels, the screen version will inevitably be disappointing, especially for those keeping inventory of the details, characters, grim thoughts and cynicism that have gone missing. For others the image of a girl like Katniss taking up so much screen space with so few smiles may be enough to keep faith.The screenplay by Mr. Ross, Ms. Collins and Billy Ray hews dutifully close to its source material, at least in wide strokes. Katniss lives in District 12 of Panem — as in panem et circenses, Latin for bread and circuses — a totalitarian state that has risen from the postwar ashes of North America. Every year a boy and a girl ages 12 to 18 are chosen from each Panem district to compete in the gladiatorial games of the title, a fight that owes something to that ancient Roman blood sport and something else to the Greek myth of the Minotaur, the part man, part bull that devoured Athenian youths given in tribute. The Minotaur is eventually slain, but that’s getting ahead of Katniss.The film takes off at the selection ceremony, or reaping, a nationally televised event complete with armed soldiers and a bubbly bubblehead M.C. (Elizabeth Banks), during which Katniss’s younger sister, Primrose (Willow Shields), is chosen. Katniss quickly volunteers to take Prim’s place, becoming, with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), District 12’s tributes. The two are whisked off to the Capitol, where they’re plucked and primped by a team of gaudily hued stylists (overseen by a gilt-lidded Lenny Kravitz as Cinna), a potentially razor-sharp sequence that should underscore the Capitol’s decadence but here comes across as a variant on Dorothy’s cheery wash- and brush-up when she enters the Emerald City. Katniss may not be in Kansas, but neither does she seem in palpable danger.That changes once she and Peeta are transported to the outdoor arena where, with wits and weapons, they battle the other tributes and assorted perils generated by the game makers (including a dandified Wes Bentley), who dole out death via computer touch screen. There, in a rapidly cut massacre that pits boy against girl and finds youngsters killing and falling and dying in a frantic, fragmented blur, Mr. Ross and his editors, Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, set the stage and stark mood. For her part Katniss, though frozen in fear, follows the advice of her and Peeta’s mentor, Haymitch (an overly cute Woody Harrelson), and runs in the opposite direction. It’s a strong, visceral scene that quickens the pace and pulse, and distills the story’s horror — suffer the little children to enter the arena — in blunt visual terms.Nothing else in the arena comes close to that initial fight in its sheer primal impact. Working with Tom Stern, Clint Eastwood’s longtime cinematographer, Mr. Ross tries to find mystery in the forest, in its canopy of trees and thick undergrowth, but never locates a deeper dread, despite the computer-generated fireballs and hounds, and especially the other tributes. Part of what makes the “Hunger Games” books so effective is that they literalize the familiar drama of adolescence, translating the emotional assaults, peer pressure, cliques and the tortured rest into warfare. “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” did the same on television, except there the villains were supernatural demons. In “The Hunger Games” the real enemies are adults, including, of course, the parents catching the show on TV.Fans of the Japanese cult film “Battle Royale” may see some overlap with its allegory about students sent to an island to fight to the death, and others may be reminded of Orson Scott Card’s science-fiction novel “Ender’s Game,” about children trained to battle an alien species. If you’ve seen the pint-size assassins in the recent action flicks “Kick-Ass” and “Hanna,” which feature prepubescent girls who lock, load and shoot without batting a lash, you may think you’ve also seen it before. You haven’t, not really. Although the girls in those movies are vaguely sexualized, their age exempts them from the narrative burdens of heterosexual romance. They don’t have to bat those lashes at the boys, and they don’t need to be saved by them either, as in the “Twilight” series.What invests Katniss with such exciting promise and keeps you rapt even when the film proves less than equally thrilling is that she also doesn’t need saving, even if she’s at an age when, most movies still insist, women go weak at the knees and whimper and weep while waiting to be saved. Again and again Katniss rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim, a combination that makes her insistently watchable, despite Mr. Ross’s soft touch and Ms. Lawrence’s bland performance. One look at District 12, which Mr. Ross conceives as a picturesque old-timey town — filled with withered Dorothea Lange types in what was once Appalachia — and it’s clear that someone here was enthralled with the actress’s breakout turn in “Winter’s Bone” as a willful, resilient child of the Ozarks.A few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission. The graver problem is a disengaged performance that rarely suggests the terrors Katniss faces, including the fatalism that originally hangs on her like a shroud. What finally saves the character and film both is the image of her on the run, moving relentlessly forward. Unlike those American Adams who have long embodied the national character with their reserves of hope, innocence and optimism, Katniss springs from someplace else, a place in which an American Eve, battered, bruised and deeply knowing, scrambles through a garden not of her making on her way to a new world.“The Hunger Games” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"Two Bickering Sisters, a Stepmom and an Ominous Garbage Can","“The Uninvited” sounds like the name of a generic horror movie, which is more or less what it is. But when you stop to think about it, the title is actually a clue to the picture’s lameness. Words beginning with “un” do have a certain scary resonance — intimations of the unknown, the undead, the uncontrollable and the unholy — but “uninvited”? As in “not on the guest list”? Only in Hollywood could such a notion be a source of terror.By the time the credits rolled (“directed by the  Guard Brothers”), I wished that the title had referred to me. But invited I was, along with a few hundred other restless souls, for whose company on a wintry Tuesday night I was profoundly grateful.Two gentlemen behind me kept up a lively, derisive banter — the kind of thing that would ordinarily drive me mad with rage but that in this case saved me a bit of work. Just at the moment when the kindly local sheriff left the heroine alone in a dark room, assuring her that no one else would get hurt — spoiler alert! he was wrong! — one fellow asked his friend: “Is this a commercial break? Because I need to go to the bathroom.”“And,” his companion said, “I need to see a commercial for a better movie.”Come to think of it, nearly any random minute of “The Uninvited” (and there are only 87 of them) could serve as just such an advertisement. The movie doesn’t look bad. It includes some picturesque shots of a handsomely rugged coastline and elegant camerawork that would be more effective if the Guards did not shamelessly telegraph every jolt and scare with obvious close-ups, low-angle shots and premature sound cues. Don’t open that garbage can! Don’t look under that stove! Don’t fall in that grave!The cast includes a worried-looking David Strathairn, and also Elizabeth Banks, gamely exploring the evil-stepmom potential latent in her fresh-faced charm. Emily Browning and Arielle Kebbel play two sisters, one spooky (that’s Anna, played by Ms. Browning), one wild (Alex, Ms. Kebbel), who fret and bicker and shriek and occasionally walk around in bathing suits.The main problem with “The Uninvited” lies in its refusal to decide just what movie it wants to be a commercial for. It certainly doesn’t have much in common with “A Tale of Two Sisters,” the creepy Korean horror film of which it is supposedly a remake.Instead it rummages around in familiar domestic genres looking for a reason to exist. Is it a melancholy, I-see-dead-people ghost story? The tale of a teenage girl whose quasi-supernatural gifts are obvious metaphors for sexual anxiety? A serial-killer-in-the-house thriller in the tradition of “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle”?Yes, all of those, though to specify in what order might give away the ridiculous climactic plot twist. And if I did that, I might never get another invitation.“The Uninvited” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some killing.

One man who lives in a shack and resembles a spiritless Tommy Lee Jones jackhammers and shovels away at his stake in the wilderness; a woeful shot at home shows a plastic baggie of documents labeled “child support.” His wealthier counterpart uses excavator machines and workers to move tons of earth in search of gold flecks. We also learn about corporate interests that control untold acres.Prospecting is doggedly shown to be a trying and somewhat antiquated process. While fiction films often tell the tale of a wildcat town’s boom and bust in about an hour, Mr. Horvath lingers over lonely digging, maps, more digging and nature montages. Mr. Horvath, an Austrian director, is a one-man band on this film, responsible for camerawork, editing and a Wagner-inspired soundtrack that periodically, and somewhat absurdly, ramps up.The prospector with the big operation actually lives in the Philippines, with an attractive younger companion. That suggests there’s still gold in those hills, but Mr. Horvath also shows they are not a playground for all comers.",0,,,0

Just Follow Directions,"One can only guess why Ethan Hawke felt compelled to make a high dive from the sublimity of “Before Midnight” into the twisted rubble of “Getaway.” What other reason could there be for a star to attach his name to a mindless demolition derby but the payday? Furthermore, Mr. Hawke is only the nominal star of a movie whose driving force is the ultimate muscle car — an armored Ford Shelby GT500 Super Snake — that runs amok in the streets of Sofia, Bulgaria. Mr. Hawke’s character, Brent Magna, is a former professional racecar driver whose wife (Rebecca Budig) is kidnapped. An anonymous caller, identified in the credits as the Voice (Jon Voight), warns Brent that he will never see her again unless he steals a vehicle from a parking garage and follows instructions.For the next 80 minutes, Brent is forced to act out an adolescent sociopath’s secret dream of running down everything in sight while driving 100 miles an hour in the wrong direction, destroying several fleets of police cars and mowing through who knows how many pedestrians. Just when the vicarious thrill of watching him obey the Voice’s order to “smash everything you can” loses its novelty, Brent is carjacked by the Kid (Selena Gomez), a shrill, bossy young woman with a baby face and a chip on her shoulder.It seems that the vehicle was her car, stolen, then souped-up for the big chase. As her tantrum subsides, we learn that the car was a present from her father, the chief executive of the city’s largest investment bank. She is also a computer whiz awkwardly spouting reams of techno jargon, spiced with profanities, as she helps Brent outwit the Voice. Directed by Courtney Solomon from a screenplay by Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker, “Getaway” was constructed in the editing room. The glimmers of wit and carnival humor in the “Fast & Furious” franchise are nowhere to be found in “Getaway,” except in its bizarre note of seasonal cheer. It’s Christmastime, and every now and then a fragment of “Jingle Bell Rock” interrupts the generic pumped-up soundtrack. “Getaway” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

He plays the father, John, an architect, and she plays the mother, Kate, who doesn’t do much of anything. Together they watch over Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and a younger girl, Max (Aryana Engineer), in one of those sprawling houses that always looks spotless even if no one ever drags a mop across its polished floors, which makes you wonder who will swab up the inevitable pooling blood.And the blood it  does spill, though not nearly fast enough. The age of the economic fright flick is apparently a thing of the past: the first “Dracula” clocked in at about 75 minutes, the original “Cat People” runs some 73 minutes, while “Night of the Living Dead” changed horror forever in just over 90 freaky minutes. “Orphan,” by contrast, comes in at a padded 2 hours 2 minutes, which is absurd for a dopey “boo” movie — as in creaking sound plus abrupt visual cut equals “boo!” — with a comically contrived premise. That premise is Esther (the very self-possessed Isabelle Fuhrman), a Russian orphan with a penetrating gaze whom John and Kate adopt with surprising swiftness and the wary blessings of a nun (C C H Pounder).The new child is meant to take the place of the stillborn fetus who haunts Kate, though alas only metaphorically, a conceit that implies that adoptees are like replacement puppies. Whatever the case, Esther is more of a she-wolf, what with an exotic accent and predatory habits that suggest she worked for Spectre  back in the motherland before landing in America as an undercover devil doll.She has her evil way with the family, as expected, preying first on the other children. The young actors are very good and perform their parts more convincingly than Ms. Farmiga and especially Mr. Sarsgaard, but there’s something creepy, and not pleasurably so, about watching children pantomime so much malice and fear.Like some other directors who started out in commercials and music video, Jaume Collet-Serra (“House of Wax”) appears to have lost a sense of narrative economy during his move from the small screen to the big. It’s doubtful that he’s entirely to blame — as unlived in as the house, the overly produced movie looks like an advertisement for the luxury car Kate drives — though you have to wonder about some of his camera choices. For one putatively crucial scene that finds Kate squawking into a phone, Mr. Collet-Serra inexplicably had someone point the camera toward the floor, a shift in focus that led me to think we were meant to find a clue in the carpeting when, really, all that had gone missing was a point of view.“Orphan” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

759,2014-08-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:19,A. O. SCOTT,"Love and Unhappiness, in Soft Shades of Gray","“Jealousy,” Philippe Garrel’s new film, begins in tears and proceeds through seasons of romantic melancholy, unfolding on Paris streets and in Bohemian apartments filmed in lovely shades of gray. The black-and-white images (captured by the great Belgian cinematographer Willy Kurant) seem to float free of time, accompanied by the disarmingly sweet tones of Jean-Louis Aubert’s music. The main character, a young actor named Louis, is based on Mr. Garrel’s father and played by his son (also named Louis). This tale of emotional ambivalence and wayward passion seems to be happening equally in the present, in the Nouvelle Vague era of the director’s young manhood, and at any other point in the long history of Gallic love trouble.Which is not to suggest that there is anything generic or imprecise about the film. On the contrary, it is almost achingly specific, a close and rigorous study of the nuances of feeling that bind and separate Louis and the women in his life. When we first meet him, he is leaving Clothilde (Rebecca Convenant), with whom he has a daughter, for reasons that seem both urgent and abstract. Clothilde begs him to stay, but Louis breaks free and goes to live with Claudia (Anna Mouglalis). At first, Claudia is terrified that he will leave or betray her, but as time goes by the poles of their relationship reverse, and he becomes the jealous one. There is obvious potential for melodrama here, but Mr. Garrel has never been interested in the traditional telescoping of feeling into big scenes and confrontations. At times his films feel as if they were entirely composed of what more conventional narrative features would leave out — the interstitial and transitional moments that invisibly link the well-marked stations of the plot. Those are the places where the richest information is stored, where the mysterious and self-evident truths of personality and feeling reside. Mr. Garrel’s method goes beyond realism to achieve a kind of psychological intimacy that is rare and, in its low-key, meandering way, tremendously exciting. It is almost uncanny how well you feel you know these people, even as their motives and behavior remain opaque to one another.In a brief 77 minutes, “Jealousy” provides a remarkably full — and also an intriguingly partial — portrait of a group of struggling artists as no-longer-entirely-young men and women. Louis belongs to a theater company that performs intense and rigorous productions of French classics, while both Clothilde and Claudia are actresses whose careers have stalled. Claudia, while professing her love for Louis, also impulsively hooks up with a stranger in a bar and later gravitates into a cynical affair with an architect.Ms. Mouglalis, tall, angular and inclined to frowning, is a perfect match for the younger Mr. Garrel’s moody sensitivity. If “Jealousy” contained just the two of them, it would be beautiful and agonized, a duet of star-crossed passion not unlike “I Can No Longer Hear the Guitar,” Philippe Garrel’s 1991 film based on his affair with the German singer Nico. This film feels lighter, warmer and more accessible than some of its predecessors, in no small part thanks to Olga Milshtein’s lively performance as Charlotte, the daughter of Louis and Clothilde. A natural screen presence with an authentic sense of mischief, Ms. Milshtein, like her character, disrupts the self-absorption of the adults with her frankness and her expectation of attention. You may wonder how much she understands about what her mother, her father and her father’s lover are up to. To the extent that this is autobiography, of course, she is the director’s surrogate, and her perspective is therefore his — curious about grown-up love and its discontents, inclined to forgive but too honest to forget anything.",1,,,1

Modern love makes me sick. Modern women make me sick. It’s like they’re men.”That tirade, in the Canadian director Anne Émond’s intriguing debut feature, “Nuit #1,” spews from the mouth of Nikolaï (Dimitri Storoge), an impoverished 31-year-old former fine-arts student who has yet to find his footing in life. His impassive listener, Clara (Catherine De Léan), is a beautiful woman around his age whom he picked up at a rave and took home for sex.Except for an opening slow-motion sequence of the rave in which the revelers bob up and down like robots on a trampoline, most of the film’s first 20 minutes are devoted to the couple’s ravenous, explicit sex. At this early point the soundtrack in your imagination might be Frank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night.” Will this attractive couple end up “lovers at first sight, in love forever?” as the song suggests? The only indication that lust might not conquer all is Nikolaï’s shabby, colorless apartment.Afterward Nikolaï falls asleep, and Clara steals out of the apartment, but he wakes up just in time to coax her back. That’s when his tantrum erupts. From here on, any romantic illusions about the pair you might have had are quickly shattered, as they share relentless soul-searching confessions of self-loathing and despair.Their eloquent monologues, interspersed with vicious verbal skirmishes, are artfully constructed, occasionally poetic expressions of pain, delivered in well-formed sentences that suggest the movie might have originated as a two-person stage drama. Nikolaï, who is of Ukrainian descent, has grandiose dreams of artistic greatness that will obviously never come true; a glance at his sketchbook reveals a draftsman of no special ability.Living hand to mouth since failing to graduate from college, Nikolaï has been fired from a series of jobs that he despises, because, as he puts it: “I show up late. I show up drunk. I show up dirty. I stink literally.”In the second half of the film, when Clara’s time comes to eviscerate herself, she describes an even bleaker existence of drugs and aimless promiscuity. She is a third-grade teacher who would have been fired long ago, she says, were it not for the teachers’ union.“I’m completely empty,” she practically boasts. “I have nothing living inside me. I don’t believe in anything.”“Nuit #1,” which halfheartedly scrapes together an ending that isn’t entirely bleak, is buoyed immeasurably by the performances of Mr. Storoge and especially of Ms. De Léan. They invest so much humanity in their miserable characters that despite your dislike, you empathize enough to think, there but for the grace of God. I can’t help wondering how many Nikolaïs and Claras there are wandering about: many more than meets the eye, I would imagine.",0,,,1

SCOTT,Review: ‘Pan’ Proposes Peter and Captain Hook’s Origin Stories,"Peter Pan, who flew through the air in a costume, was in many ways a prototype of the modern superhero. He has certainly been a lucrative entertainment franchise for a very long time, with durable merchandising potential, from feathered hats to peanut butter. All of which may help to explain the otherwise baffling existence of “Pan,” a hectic and labored attempt to supply the boy who never grew up with an origin story.The film has a decent pedigree. The director is Joe Wright, a tested hand at literary adaptation whose efforts have been both underrated (“Anna Karenina”) and the opposite (“Atonement”). Rooney Mara and the spectral emanation of Amanda Seyfried both show up, as does Hugh Jackman, the hardest-working man in movieland, playing Blackbeard, Peter’s pirate nemesis. Captain Hook is in the movie, too, but he’s a good guy, and hints about his future turn toward villainy — and the loss of his hand — are among the dispiriting signs that a sequel may be in the works.Meanwhile, there is enough going on in in “Pan” to fill several movies, most of which you’ve already seen and perhaps enjoyed under other titles. There are mermaids and ships to remind you of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise, and a dreamy landscape populated by virtuous animists that recalls “Avatar.” Hook, played by Garrett Hedlund, is a Han Solo type with an Indiana Jones hat and an odd Jimmy Stewart way of talking. Peter (Levi Miller) is given a vaguely Potteresque messiah complex, and subjected to a lot of talk about prophecies and chosenness. Blackbeard rules over a dusty hellhole swarming with enslaved children, the kind of place we’ve seen a hundred times before. That the captives sing a cappella choral renditions of “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and “Blitzkreig Bop” does not add much in the way of freshness.The action sequences are murky and chaotic, taking place in dim light made more so by 3-D glasses. Ships fly through the air. Battles are fought. The mood swings unsteadily from jaunty to weepy to sinister. Unsettling deaths and disturbing revelations are followed by swashbuckling merriment.In the middle of it all, poor Peter, who starts out in a London orphanage during the Blitz, does his best to reconcile his natural cheekiness with somber themes of loss and longing. The character’s pluck and mischief are nearly drowned in a bog of maudlin mommy love, and his vows of vengeance dampen the spirit of fun. The dominant emotion in “Pan” is the desperation of the filmmakers, who frantically try to pander to a young audience they don’t seem to respect, understand or trust.“Pan” is rated PG. It’s grimmer than you might expect, in every way.",0,35914825.0,35088320.0,0

Juggling tics, double takes, eyeball bulges and explosive gestures, he leaps in the air and splats in the sand with cartoon abandon, buoyed by the jokes and the big bounce of his own stardom.With his thrusting jaw, Lyn looks as if he could have been drawn by Milton Caniff, the creator of the comic-strip tough guy Steve Canyon. Instead Lyn has been drawn in crude if generally effective strokes by Mr. Clooney and his producing partner, Grant Heslov, who together also wrote “Good Night, and Good Luck.” Mr. Clooney directed that film, but for this one Mr. Heslov has moved behind the camera to make a somewhat ragged directing debut. Though he never settles into a groove, moving between would-be parody and could-be sincerity, Mr. Heslov does keep the parts more or less in play, aided by the outlandishness of his story and by the performances of Mr. Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Stephen Lang.Written by Peter Straughan and based on the nonfiction book by Jon Ronson, also titled “The Men Who Stare at Goats,” the film tells parallel stories that finally join. One involves a journalist, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), who after his marriage tanks, heads to Iraq to give his life meaning. What he discovers is Lyn, a recruit in the mysterious New Earth Army, an experimental Army program centered on parapsychology that was developed by a Vietnam vet, Bill Django (Mr. Bridges) and pushed into creation by the gonzo General Hopgood (Mr. Lang). Realizing that he has the makings of a juicy story, Bob tags after Lyn, a decision that leads him both into Iraq and Lyn’s past in the New Earth Army.Bill’s initiative, born in the fields of Vietnam and baptized in the hot tubs of the New Age movement, brings together Buddhism, pantheism, militarism and old-fashioned hooey-ism, the idea being that war can be waged with love, eagle feathers and assorted paranormal techniques — with a few martial arts moves thrown in. General Hopgood and Lyn take to the program with a seriousness bordering on devotional, partly because Bill, or rather the irresistible Mr. Bridges, could inspire lemmings of any genus.   His batty smile and loosey-goosey gestural performance, which brings to mind a modern dance teacher stoned on good vibes, perfectly complements Mr. Lang’s spring-loaded turn. (Mr. Lang is having a very nice year, with roles  also in Michael Mann’s “Public Enemies” and James Cameron’s “Avatar.”)Mr. Clooney doesn’t play his part as straight as Mr. Lang or Mr. Bridges  and, especially during the flashbacks when he’s forced into a sloppy pageboy, he seems to be enjoying the joke too much. What makes Mr. Lang’s performance work so well is its unwavering seriousness: he never lets self-amusement cloud his eyes, or his acting. Not so Mr. McGregor, a predictably attractive if superfluous  presence. What makes this a story worth telling, it emerges quickly, isn’t the journalist but the men who thought they could travel the world or stop a goat’s heart with their minds. The journalist hook is an easy way into the material, but both Bob and the flashbacks, which probably account for some of Mr. Heslov’s unsteadiness, get in the way.There’s more in the mix, including another New Earth Army member, played by an agreeably malevolent Kevin Spacey, and many goats. (They stare right back, by the way.) They’re all fine company, but like Bob and Lyn’s drifting adventures in Iraq, which finds them tooling down dusty roads on a mystery mission, they don’t leave much of a trace. There’s a curious evanescence to the movie, which while apparently based in truth — it recalls a multimillion-dollar project called Star Gate dedicated to parapsychology research that came to light in the mid-1990s — doesn’t add up to anything. It’s wacky, amusing.  But that’s about it. If there are truths to be drawn from the military’s use of men to locate hostages psychically, they’re not evident here.There is a Lyn in Mr. Ronson’s book, Lyn Buchanan, who wrote about his experience in Star Gate in “The Seventh Sense: The Secrets of Remote Viewing as Told by a ‘Psychic Spy’ for the U.S. Military.” If you think that sounds outlandish, consider that a document on the Central Intelligence Agency Web site claims that the Defense Intelligence Agency has a psychic center, and that the National Security Agency studies parapsychology.  Furthermore, the C.I.A. “reportedly is a member of an Incident Response Team to investigate U.F.O. landings, if one should occur,” the site says. “This team has never met. The lack of solid C.I.A. documentation on Agency U.F.O.-related activities in the 1980s leaves the entire issue somewhat murky for this period.”“The Men Who Stare at Goats” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

However pastoral, this isn’t the forest primeval but the very edge of free land outside the impoverished zone in which Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her relatives, friends and the other starved souls labor for Panem, the authoritarian state built on the ruins of North America after a catastrophic war. It’s here that she hunts game to feed her family and where this startlingly new pioneer — with her bow and arrows, leather jacket and boots, primitive individualism and totally awesome strength of character — was forged. “Catching Fire” is the follow-up to “The Hunger Games” and the second in what will be four movie adaptations of Suzanne Collins’s fantastically successful book trilogy. (The studio behind the series, Lionsgate, is splitting the final book into two flicks.) It’s largely satisfying as far as screen adventures go, and comes fully loaded with special effects and action scenes, and embellished with the usual brand-name character actors, including the new arrivals Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer. It also has a different director, Francis Lawrence (replacing Gary Ross), who showed he knows his way around the post-apocalypse with the Will Smith vehicle “I Am Legend.” (Given Katniss’s increasingly valiant trajectory, that title would have been apt for this dystopian romp.)A thrillingly atypical heroine, Katniss is the heart, soul and bloodied embodiment of the series and the primary reason that both the book and screen versions soar above the usual adventure-fiction slag heap. Like most cultural sensations, which invariably owe part of their success to their recognizability (familiarity breeds revenue), “The Hunger Games” builds on stories deep in our collective databanks, from the Greek myth of the Minotaur to the fall of Rome, and “Survivor,” the seemingly indestructible reality TV franchise. Like the 2000 Japanese movie “Battle Royale,” to which it bears some resemblance, “The Hunger Games” works because it hits that sweet spot where classical myth meets contemporary anxiety to become a pop mind-blower. Like a lot of middle sections, “Catching Fire” at once expands on the first part of the series and functions as a feature-long teaser for what will happen next. Shortly after the movie gets going, after Katniss has stashed away a rabbit from one of her snares and cozied up to Gale (Liam Hemsworth), one of her uneasy love interests (she’s the reluctant party), she is sent on a victory tour with the second one, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). In the first “Hunger Games,” Katniss and Peeta won the annual contest of the title, a match that pits a girl and a boy, 12 to 18, from each of the 12 Panem districts against one another in a battle to the death, a setup that speaks to its young adult fans and takes adolescent bullying to gladiatorial extremes.Metaphors aside, the games are principally a heavy stick that Panem, led by President Snow (an amused Donald Sutherland), uses to keep the progressively restive populace in check. President Snow is the big bad daddy of the series, the patriarchal heavy whom Katniss — who more or less took her own father’s place, after he died — is destined to overthrow. Something is in the air, she realizes in “Catching Fire,” when she glimpses seditious graffiti and other signs of dissent.For now, though, as the story builds and builds and sometimes drags, and the studio squeezes the franchise for all it’s worth, Katniss primarily needs to irritate Snow, which finds Ms. Lawrence throwing variations of her scowl in Mr. Sutherland’s direction, while his caterpillar eyebrows jitterbug above his trademark silky-sinister smirk.The script, by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn (a pseudonym for the screenwriter Michael Arndt), effectively distills the novel to the essentials from Katniss and Peeta’s victory lap, which involves a visit to the Capitol and the other districts, includes batted lashes and chaste kisses, and finally leads to the main event: a new round of games that pits past winners against one another in an ultimate death match called the Quarter Quell. There, on a simulated island created by the new head gamemaster (an uncomfortable-looking Mr. Hoffman), Katniss and Peeta make friends as they fight foes and endure buckets of blood, poisonous fog, shrieking monkeys and, in a scarily visceral scene, birds that mimic the voices and screams of the combatants’ loved ones, as if they were under torture.Mr. Lawrence gives “Catching Fire” a tougher, less sentimental feel this time around — there appears to be more kissing but less mooning about — that fits the material and Ms. Lawrence’s gift for projecting unaffected indomitableness. The actress is more expressive here than she was in the first movie, where her lack of convincing affect, including clenching fear, was at odds with the violent stakes. There’s no indeterminacy here, either in her performance or the direction, which both go a long way to clarifying Katniss and turning a girl with a bow into the charismatic figure she was always meant to be. (It’s nice, too, that the consistently appealing Elizabeth Banks, as the kaleidoscopic kook Effie Trinket, is allowed to deliver an actual performance this time.)“Catching Fire” isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time. “The mythic America,” the literary critic Leslie Fiedler memorably wrote, “is boyhood.” One of the things that “The Hunger Games,” on the page and on the screen, suggests is that the myth is changing. Boys (and men) are still boys, of course, including in movies, but the very existence of Katniss — who fights her own battles, and kisses and leaves the boys, only sometimes to save them — suggests cultural consumers are ready for change, even if most cultural producers remain foolishly stuck in the past. It’s unlikely Katniss will lead the real revolution the movies need, but a woman can dream.“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,Canine TV Action Star Discovers That Life Is the Best Reality Show,"“Bolt” tells the story of a pampered celebrity — a television action star — who is cast out of his cocoon of fame and privilege and forced to deal with the challenges of the real world. The digitally animated real world, that is, in which the hero, a talking dog voiced by the real-life movie star John Travolta, encounters wise-guy pigeons, a cynical cat (Susie Essman) and a worshipful, geeky hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton).Since puppyhood, Bolt, in the series that shares his name and the movie’s, has played a genetically altered, fearless supercanine who every week must rescue his owner, a girl named Penny (Miley Cyrus of “Hannah Montana” fame), from the clutches of a dastardly villain (Malcolm McDowell).Bolt’s performance is effortlessly authentic because he is entirely unaware that it is a performance. Somewhat like Jim Carrey’s Truman in “The Truman Show,” Bolt accepts the reality of his Jerry Bruckheimer-like habitat of chases, explosions and special effects because he has never known anything else. Once outside, he is perplexed to discover that he is, after all, an ordinary dog.With brisk wit and impressive visual brio, “Bolt,” directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams from a script by Mr. Williams and Dan Fogelman, explores an existential predicament that it also shares. It is at once a knowing, satirical sendup of the Hollywood fame-and-fantasy machinery and a sleek, expensive product of the Disney-Pixar industrial complex.While artisanal Pixar touches abound in the exquisitely detailed animation, the story shows some signs of repurposing and committee work. Bolt’s situation is a bit like Buzz Lightyear’s in “Toy Story” — he must learn that what he thinks of as his true identity is an artifact of make-believe — and a lot like Lightning McQueen’s in “Cars.” His circular journey of exile and return, during which he acquires a new self that is a better version of the old one, resembles those of Nemo, Wall-E and quite a few of the Disney princess heroines of old. And, as is Disney custom, Bolt is accompanied, and often upstaged, by a goofy chatterbox sidekick, the ridiculous Rhino, who rarely leaves his plexiglass exercise sphere.But if “Bolt” — originally conceived by the old regime at the Disney animation studios and refurbished after John Lasseter of Pixar took over — does not quite rise to the level of bona fide Pixar masterpieces like “Wall-E,” “Finding Nemo” and “Ratatouille,” it does manage to be frisky, funny and inventive enough to engage the attention of grown-ups as well as children. Perhaps some of the show-biz jokes will sail over the heads of very young viewers, who won’t understand why Penny’s unctuous agent keeps talking about sticking pins in things (I’m not sure I did), or what that mean lady from the network is so angry about.But then, such knowing insidery humor is hardly limited to self-conscious HBO shows like “Entourage” or “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Kids’ stuff like “Hannah Montana” and “iCarly” plays the same trompe l’oeil tricks in a more wholesome context, feeding young viewers the illusion that they can see through the clouds of hype and cynicism that make up more and more of the cultural air they breathe.What keeps “Bolt” fresh is an unaffected exuberance, a genuine sense of fun, that is expressed above all through obsessive attention to craft. The movie has three sets of talking pigeons, each group embodying a regional stereotype, and while I found the dese-dem-dose New York birds amusing, and their aspiring-screenwriter Los Angeles counterparts downright hilarious, it was the uncanny bobbing and twisting movements of the birds’ heads and the shuffle of their little pigeon feet that raised the conceit from clever to sublime.Similarly, Bolt is a cute enough little fellow with a winning personality and a nice voice, but his physical gestures and facial expressions turn him into a memorable, irresistible character. The 3-D version of the movie, which will be shown in some theaters, is less devoted to the kind of big effects that throw you back in your seat than to a more thorough and understated expansion of cinematic possibilities.“Bolt,” in other words, is a real movie — not a great one, perhaps, but a more organic and thought-out piece of work than the usual animated hodgepodge that lures antsy children and their dutiful parents into the multiplexes. It has its sentimental strains, but it doesn’t push them too hard, or resort to the crude, pandering humor of, say, the “Shrek” franchise. Like its hero after he wakes up from his Hollywood dream life, it’s friendly, smart and eager to please. Cat people need not worry — hamster fans will be in heaven, but that’s another story — since there is enough sly, predatory feline humor to keep the thing from going entirely to the dogs.“Bolt” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the early action sequences, and a climactic scene of danger, may be too intense for small children.BOLTOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Chris Williams and Byron Howard; written by Dan Fogelman and Mr. Williams; animation supervisor, Doug Bennett; art director, Paul Felix; produced by Clark Spencer; released by Walt Disney Pictures.

Rather than focus on her own experience with the discipline, which she has practiced to great physical and spiritual benefit for many years, she enlisted a yoga novice to devote himself to it and report on its effects.So she recruited Nick Rosen, 29, a physically fit, intellectually skeptical journalist from New York, to plunge into the world of yoga in search of a style that suited him. Approaching the subject through Mr. Rosen is a doubly smart strategy: it allows the uninitiated viewer to explore yoga through a surrogate, and it marginalizes Ms. Churchill’s blatant agenda and rather grating personality.Yoga appeals to Mr. Rosen as a superb workout more than as a route to enlightenment, and he tours the various studios and methods of the international yoga scene (from New York to Los Angeles and Hawaii before an extended, and fascinating, trip to India) with both an open mind and a dubious eye for its more metaphysical trappings. This clearly frustrates a filmmaker eager to acclaim the “transformative” aspects of the discipline.As the title indicates, “Enlighten Up!” explores its subject with a light touch and welcome sense of humor. That it ends with a lack of resolution about yoga’s ultimate goal suggests that Mr. Rosen wasn’t the only one to gain some self-knowledge along the way.ENLIGHTEN UP!Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Kate Churchill; written by Ms. Churchill and Jonathon Hexner, based on a story by Ms. Churchill, Mr. Hexner and Khari Streeter; director of photography, Mr. Hexner; edited by Mr. Streeter and Jonathan Sahula; music by Krishna Venkatesh; animation by Mr. Hexner; released by Balcony Releasing.

O. SCOTT,"Happy Birthday, You Miserable Achievers","What’s going on with Pete and Debbie? First of all: You remember Pete and Debbie, don’t you? They were the designated grown-ups played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann in “Knocked Up,” a movie about the accidental conception and hilarious gestation of their niece. If you want an update on that child, who would be in kindergarten by now, you won’t find it in “This Is 40,” Judd Apatow’s “sort-of sequel” to the earlier movie and the fourth feature film he has directed. (The baby’s parents were played by Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, who have moved on to other things.)This one is all about Pete and Debbie, who, along with their two daughters, occupy a big white house in one of Los Angeles’s nicer ZIP codes and who, in the course of a hectic week, undergo — well, what, exactly? A matched set of midlife crises? A rough patch in their marriage? A flurry of “first-world problems” so trivial as to be an insult to the planet’s struggling masses? A seminar in postmodern, postfeminist gender politics? Yes, sure, all of that, but to drop their troubles into such neat conceptual boxes would be to simplify a situation that is both agreeably and annoyingly messy.All of a sudden — and not, you suspect, for the first time — the stresses of work, parenthood, money and intimacy threaten to add up to something big and scary. Pete’s record label is in financial peril, which he hopes the success of a new album by the British New Wave stalwart Graham Parker will dispel. Debbie, who owns a boutique, suspects that one of her employees (either Charlyne Yi or Megan Fox) is embezzling money. Pete’s father (Albert Brooks) is a noodge and a sponge, constantly borrowing money from his grown son to support his do-over lifestyle, which features rambunctious blond triplets. Debbie’s dad (John Lithgow), who also has a second family, is a chilly, intermittent presence in her life.Then there are the adolescent mood swings of Pete and Debbie’s older daughter, Sadie (Maude Apatow), and the skirmishes that break out between Sadie and her irrepressible younger sister, Charlotte (Iris Apatow).Hovering over all of this hectic business is something vaguer, deeper and sadder: a malaise in Pete and Debbie’s relationship that leads them to question the foundations of their marriage. In a panic in the wake of a momentous birthday, Debbie embarks on a campaign of family self-improvement, limiting screen time, cooking healthy meals and nagging everyone into a frenzy that almost matches her own. For his part, Pete clowns, mopes and steals away to the bathroom to play with his iPad.Cushioned by comforts that most of their fellow citizens can scarcely imagine, they nonetheless feel as if things were starting to go pear-shaped. (Only metaphorically: The two of them are enviably trim, in spite of Pete’s weakness for cupcakes. He bikes a lot.)“Do you still even like me?” Debbie asks her husband in one of many moments of vulnerability.An entirely plausible answer would be: Who cares? We’ve all got troubles, sister. But I want to suggest that the movie’s ability to foresee — even to welcome — a hostile or indifferent response counts in its favor. “This Is 40” is an intensely, at times embarrassingly, personal film, by a man who has worked hard, lucked out and wants to share some of his happiness and its attendant worries with the rest of us. Mr. Apatow is, quite literally, showing off his lovely wife (that would be Ms. Mann) and their lively, talented daughters, and if Mr. Rudd is not precisely an alter ego (a description that might equally apply to Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and plenty of other male performers in comedies bearing the Apatow brand), he is at least a plausible place holder. He is nice but not cloying, goofy but not dumb, smart but not snotty, and good-looking in a way that doesn’t make the rest of us feel too bad about ourselves.Mr. Brooks, a godfather of neurotic, passive-aggressive film comedy, once made a movie called “Defending Your Life.” Mr. Apatow, though he has absorbed some of Mr. Brooks’s deadpan, buried-joke filmmaking style, does not share his penchant for anxious introspection. The social milieu of “This Is 40” is generationally, geographically and professionally adjacent to the one explored by Larry David in “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” but any trace of that show’s self-lacerating misanthropy has been filtered out of the Southern California air. A gaggle of funny troupers — including Melissa McCarthy, Jason Segel, Chris O’Dowd and Lena Dunham — shuffles through the picture, offering up bursts of shtick, but there is more sweetness than cruelty in most of their antics.In other words, for all its crude jokes and on-the-money observations of the tastes and consumer habits of aging white Gen X-ers (we still love the Pixies!), “This Is 40” should not be mistaken for satire. While it makes fun of some of Pete’s and Debbie’s foibles and blind spots — his immaturity, her neediness, their complementary ways of not listening to each other — it declines to treat the characters as types or to treat their behavior as symptomatic.The audience, of course, is free to take up the slack, to despise Pete and Debbie, even at the risk of hypocrisy. Look at those two, fretting about money, with a BMW and a Lexus in the driveway, the kids in private school and enough left over for a romantic resort getaway and a lavish catered birthday party.In a town that runs on philanthropic fund-raisers and celebrity activism, Pete and Debbie support no cause beyond themselves. They are complacent, over-entitled and kind of mean. But the film’s refusal of the detachment that would make them easy targets for judgment is finally a mark of integrity, even generosity. You are brought into a state of intimacy, of complicity, with characters you may find it difficult to like but who, at the same time, require constant affirmation of their goodness.And they are good, or at least good enough. So is the movie. It snuggles up next to you, breathes in your face, dribbles crumbs on your shirt and laughs at its own jokes. Such proximity makes it easy to notice flaws, and there are a lot of loose ends and a few forced conclusions. But, then again, the acceptance of imperfection is Mr. Apatow’s theme, so a degree of sloppiness is to be expected. That’s life.“This Is 40” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drug use, smoking and swearing. They say it’s the new 20.",0,65200000.0,67544505.0,1

Burns,2011,6.6,196580.0,84.0,2017-11-02 04:18:14,MANOHLA DARGIS,A Nightmare Pox on Your Civilized World,"“Contagion,” Steven Soderbergh’s smart, spooky thriller about a thicket of contemporary plagues — a killer virus, rampaging fear, an unscrupulous blogger — is as ruthlessly effective as the malady at its cool, cool center. Set in the world-is-flat now, the movie tracks a mystery pathogen after it catches a ride on a flight from Hong Kong to Chicago, an early hop for a globe-sprinting pandemic that cuts across borders and through bodies as effortlessly as Mr. Soderbergh moves among genres, styles and eras, this time by updating 1970s paranoia freakouts like “All the President’s Men” for the anti-government, Tea Party age.Among the first casualties is an executive, Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow), who, shortly after returning home from Hong Kong, is twitching on her Minneapolis kitchen floor, mouth foaming and eyes glassing over. Was it the moo goo gai pan? Not exactly, her husband, Mitch (Matt Damon in a small, crucial, sympathetic performance), soon learns. And that’s something you learn quickly in turn: Nothing moves slowly here, especially the disease, which, within days, cuts down seemingly everyone who’s been within touching, kissing, handshaking, dice-blowing distance of a carrier. Like the ladies in the old shampoo ads (“I told two friends about it and they told two friends and so on”) Beth just keeps on giving.Working with regular collaborators like the writer Scott Z. Burns, the composer Cliff Martinez and the editor Stephen Mirrione, Mr. Soderbergh invests the story with visceral urgency, opening it with a screen steeped in black — an intimation perhaps of the looming abyss — and the sounds of a few hard, rasping coughs. This almost deviously funny overture is followed by a close-up of Beth wearing a sheen of sweat and no visible makeup, the image stamped “Day 2.” Listing forward, as if she was about to throw up on the camera tilted up at her, she looks about as bad as Ms. Paltrow probably can, given the ugly situation and the queasy-beautiful yellowish light that Mr. Soderbergh expressionistically employs throughout.She doesn’t vomit, but your own gorge may rise when the camera shifts from Beth — who takes a flirty call from her unseen lover, her wedding ring gleaming in the shot — to linger briefly on a jar of shelled peanuts set on the airport bar in front of her. Beth may be (relatively) bad, but those peanuts are murder, as is the credit card she hands to the waitress. The story subsequently hopscotches to several other people — a young man stumbling through a Hong Kong market, a Japanese salaryman grimacing on a plane and a model staggering in London — who flash in and out of the movie . Like Beth, whose young son, Clark (Griffin Kane), welcomes her home with open, vulnerable arms, each proves to be part of the lethal puzzle.Those scrambling to put the pieces together include Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), a deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and another doctor, Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), whom he sends into a chaotic field that, before long, is littered with the dead and populated by a mounting military presence. Rounding out a medical SWAT team, which is almost as self-consciously sexy and quirky as the thieves in Mr. Soderbergh’s “Ocean’s” movies, are a pair of C.D.C. doctors, Ally Hextall (a wonderful Jennifer Ehle) and David Eisenberg (Demetri Martin), who hoist test tubes and send rhesus monkeys to their deaths, as well as a sleuthing doctor for the World Health Organization, Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard). Elliott Gould, one of Mr. Soderbergh’s favorites and a keystone “Ocean’s” player, adds to the casting pleasures.There are a few obvious villains, notably a San Francisco blogger (Jude Law, snaggletoothed and embracing the designated creep role) with the unfortunate name of Alan Krumwiede, as in crumb-weedy. (Mr. Soderbergh also took aim at bloggers in “The Girlfriend Experience.”) A self-proclaimed outsider — “print media is dying,” he yells at a skeptical (and pregnant) newspaper editor — Krumwiede latches onto the pandemic early and before long is profiting from it on his blog (Truth Serum Now), where he pushes a holistic cure, forsythia, a yellow flowering plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. Mr. Soderbergh may like to play outside the cinematic mainstream now and then (as in “Bubble”), but there’s no place for alternatives like blogging and complementary medicine in “Contagion,” where the stakes are too catastrophically high.There’s another villain lurking (or rather bulldozing) in the shadows, but the most obvious peril is the virus, in and out of the laboratory. To that race-against-time end there are weirdly beautiful, near-surreal images of Ally and David wafting about in their violently red protective suits like space travelers heading off to science-fiction battle. Except that they — like the other good doctors, including Erin, seen wrangling one regional official who testily asks who’s paying for the triage services provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other big-government groups — are terra-firma rationalists. They’re fighting a disease along with natural fear and unnatural fear mongers like Krumwiede, who, from his bloggy pulpit, dismisses science in the name of independence even as he sells out his readers.In its dystopian vision of a present calamitously infected by fear, paranoia, self-interest and the denial of science, this movie is certainly of the moment even if it also evokes the past. At several points Krumwiede meets up with a speculator who’s looking to turn a profit on the crisis, in scenes that suggest Robert Redford, as Bob Woodward, hovering in the dark with Deep Throat in “All the President’s Men.” The meetings in the two movies are conspicuously different in look and intent, yet the characters seem to be gasping the same unclean air as they shed light on a shadow world of power, greed and dirty tricks. One crucial difference being that in the 1970s it was the government that played the villain while this time it’s on the side of right.Once it may have been hard to buy the swift collapse of order that is made palpably real in “Contagion,” if Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath had not already set the stage. Mr. Soderbergh doesn’t milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images of men and women isolated in the frame, in the blurred point of view of the dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look. The virus seriously rattles your nerves, and you may want to start stockpiling antibacterial soap now. Yet what’s really scary in “Contagion” is how fast once-humming airports and offices, homes and cities empty out when push comes to shove comes to panic in the streets.“Contagion” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It contains gun violence, multiple on-screen if nongory deaths and a graphic autopsy during which a human head is peeled like a banana.CONTAGIONOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Steven Soderbergh; written by Scott Z.

At one point in “Reset,” the riveting documentary by Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai that chronicles Mr. Millepied choreographing a new ballet, he grabs an injured dancer’s foot and vigorously massages the heel. “Softer is pointless,” he says, ignoring her whimpers.Mr. Millepied, the choreographer for the Darren Aronofsky film “Black Swan” (where he met his wife, Natalie Portman) and former principal at New York City Ballet, doesn’t do soft. He may be French, but in “Reset,” Mr. Millepied — brash, funny, intelligent — is very much an American living in Paris. And most of us already know the job didn’t work out in the end: Last year he announced his resignation as director of dance there.It’s hard to make changes at the bureaucratic Paris Opera, yet Mr. Millepied — something of a real-life Rodrigo from “Mozart in the Jungle” — weathers it all with cheerful tenacity. He can be elusive, especially to his assistant, who is continually asking, “Have you seen Benjamin?” In one meeting, she rattles off his list of appointments; he turns to the camera with a hand covering his mouth and says: “Look at her diary. She’s going to kill me.”But “Reset” also fleshes out the creative process and shows how, for Mr. Millepied, pleasure must always be part of dance. Did the film make me want to see Mr. Millepied’s ballet, “Clear, Loud, Bright, Forward,” on the stage? Yes. And that’s high praise.",1,98574.0,,1

SCOTT,Examining Romanian Fault Lines,"The Romanian director Lucian Pintilie made his first film in 1965, the year Nicolae Ceausescu became general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party. During the subsequent decades of Ceausescu’s dictatorship, which ended in 1989, Mr. Pintilie, like many independent-minded Eastern European artists, tried to work within the system and then went into exile, leaving for the West in 1973 and returning after Ceausescu was gone.Of the films he was able to complete in Romania, “Reenactment” (1970) stands among the exemplary works of its region and time. Subtle, difficult and brave, it represents a powerful statement of artistic honesty in a culture of official lies and evasions.“Reenactment” is included in a two-week retrospective that begins on Thursday at the Museum of Modern Art. This comprehensive program also offers American audiences a chance to sample Mr. Pintilie’s more recent films, among them “Niki and Flo,” a mordant almost-comedy from 2003 that represents a bridge — and also a battle — between the old Romania and the new. It will run for a week at MoMA, receiving a belated and welcome North American premiere.The screenplay was written by Cristi Puiu and Razvan Radulescu, who came of age in the Ceausescu era and its aftermath and who would go on to collaborate on “The Death of Mr. Lazarescu” (directed by Mr. Puiu), the breakthrough film of the Romanian new wave. Mr. Pintilie is one of the few older Romanian directors active in the Communist period claimed as an influence by the skeptical realists of the younger generation, who mostly disdain the oblique, allegorical aesthetics and the compromised politics of their elders. “Niki and Flo” is a fascinating stylistic hybrid, its observant naturalism infused with a delicate, almost coy sense of the absurd.The title characters are a pair of aging men linked — like Alan Arkin and Peter Falk in “The In-Laws” —by the marriage of their children. Niki (Victor Rebengiuc), a retired colonel in the Romanian Army, has a stoical demeanor but a way of carrying himself that suggests a reservoir of gentleness and sensitivity. He is also grieving, stricken when we first meet him in the spring of 2001, by the sudden death of his only son, Mihai (Marius Galea), and the impending departure of his daughter, Angela (Dorina Chiriac), for America with her husband, Eugen (Serban Pavlu).Eugen’s father is Florian, known as Flo, whose aggressive, ridiculous embrace of modernity stands in comic, painful contrast to Niki’s impassive traditionalism. A know-it-all and a micromanager, a dabbler in fads who mistakes boorishness for flair, Flo wears a baseball cap emblazoned with the word Genius (in English) and presents Niki with a video of Eugen and Angela’s wedding labeled (in French) “un film de Florian Tufaru.”Niki’s viewing of that oeuvre is a crucial moment in “Niki and Flo.” Flo’s amateurish, accidentally revealing pseudo-cinematic flourishes amplify the moods and themes suggested by Mr. Pintilie’s patient, classical way of filming and cutting. The wedding is a perfectly ordinary episode that is, therefore, a volatile blend of farcical and tragic elements, a wild party in which the latent tensions within the families and the subterranean contradictions of their society rise to the surface without being quite acknowledged.“Niki and Flo” spends time with a variety of characters, including Eugen and Angela; their mothers, Poucha (the marvelous Coca Bloos) and Doina (Mihaela Caracas); and Mihai’s widow, Irina (Andreea Bibiri). Its center of gravity, however, is unquestionably Niki, whose suffering is all but invisible to everyone around him. His evident struggle to uphold an ideal of capable, selfless, patriotic manhood — an ideal no one else seems to care about or even recognize — is the axis of the film’s drama, and it turns into something larger, more complicated and more frightening than the quiet sorrow of an old man.Like Mr. Pintilie’s “Reenactment,” “Niki and Flo” pivots, in ways I am reluctant to reveal, from calm, unstated tension to almost surreal violence. The shocks that arrive in the film’s final act may seem arbitrary, but they are also reminders that normalcy — whether in the vanished, shadowy world of Communism or in the bright, familiar domain of consumer capitalism — is always founded on hypocrisy and menaced by chaos.",1,,,0

Heard over this man-made earthquake, Mr. Young’s passionate cracked whine assumes an oracular power. As always in his singing and songwriting, time weighs heavily. The cantankerous old man and the lost little boy are one and the same.The movie, which follows Mr. Demme’s earlier concert films, “Neil Young: Heart of Gold” (2006) and “Trunk Show” (2009), was shot at Massey Hall in Toronto in May 2011, during Mr. Young’s solo tour supporting his 2010 album, “Le Noise.” The material is divided between songs recorded for that album (including two outtakes) and old favorites. Mostly it is a very loud concert, but the roar is more earthshaking than earsplitting.Onstage Mr. Young, in jeans and a straw hat, is shot mostly in close-up from below the microphone. Now in his mid-60s, he suggests a grizzled cowboy ferociously squinting into a Canadian sunset. The camera is close enough to his whiskered face that you can peer into his mouth. A wooden Indian sits on the stage next to a keyboard to which Mr. Young occasionally repairs for songs like “I Believe In You.” But his electronically processed guitar dominates.Before it settles down into a concert film, the movie shows Mr. Young reminiscing and pointing out personal landmarks while driving around Omemee, his southern Ontario hometown and setting of his ballad “Helpless.”The opening number, from “Le Noise,” is his angry-sorrowful environmentally conscious ballad “Peaceful Valley Boulevard,” which remembers how the West was won in an insatiable quest for gold and oil, then leaps into the present with its final image of a polar bear drifting on an ice floe. History is a tale of rapacious conquest and destruction with an apocalyptic ending.“Ohio” is accompanied by footage of the 1970 protests at Kent State University, at which four students were killed by Ohio National Guardsmen. The slain students are named and their pictures shown. More than four decades later it still hurts.In the most wrenching verses of “Love and War” he pictures brides of servicemen killed in action trying to explain to their children “why daddy won’t ever come home again.” The song includes a confessional aside in which Mr. Young declares, “The saddest thing in the whole wide world is to break the heart of your lover,” something he admits in the lyrics to having done.In the concert’s climactic number, “Hitchhiker,” an autobiographical account of life on the road over many decades, he apologizes to a wife he neglected, names the drugs he took (hashish, amphetamines, Valium, marijuana and cocaine), recalls a bout of paranoia, and wishes he were an Aztec or an Inca.Mr. Young’s music is a neo-primitive style unto itself. His elemental folk-rock tunes are equipped with rough, scrawled lyrics that reach for the primal and the personal at the same time in a language that is both aphoristic and enigmatic. A great example is found in words from his reflection on rock ’n’ roll history, “My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)”:Out of the blue and into the blackThey give you this but you pay for thatAnd once you’re gone you can never come back.What exactly does it mean? I would say, everything and nothing.“Neil Young Journeys” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the songs have drug references.",1,214588.0,,1

O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Everest’ Revisits a Fateful Adventure in 3-D   ,"“Because it’s there” is a perfectly valid justification for climbing an enormous mountain — a famous one, at any rate — but maybe not a good enough reason to see a movie. Or to make a movie, for that matter. Technically, of course, a film isn’t really “there” until someone makes it, and “Everest,” a breathless, large-scale 3-D action spectacle (directed by Baltasar Kormakur) about an ill-starred attempt to scale the planet’s highest peak, was called into being with impressive star power and technical bravura. It definitely exists. But it never seems to get anywhere, taking up space and time without managing to be especially memorable or imposing.In theory, the stakes should be high and the drama intense, as human beings battle the brute forces of nature in a life-or-death struggle. But though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, “Everest” feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure.This may be partly because one of the film’s themes is the commodification of adventure, the colonization of a wild and dangerous terrestrial spot by tourists and thrill seekers. The individual climbers who receive most of our attention are treated with empathy and respect — the Westerners, that is; the Nepalese Sherpas who guide and assist them barely figure at all — but Everest itself is a mob scene. The feeling of discovery, of primal wonder at the inhuman sublimity of the mountain, has been compromised. People with a lot of money and little climbing experience turn the base camp into a virtual trailer park and litter the upper slopes with discarded ropes, flags and oxygen tanks. Professional tour leaders are expected to ensure the safety of clients who insist on pushing toward the summit despite potentially fatal risks.“Everest” turns partly on the rivalry between two seasoned climbers: Rob Hall, a stoic, disciplined New Zealander played by the ever-solid Jason Clarke; and Scott Fischer, a gonzo American played with marvelous mischief by Jake Gyllenhaal. Their ascent in the spring of 1996, during which eight people died and many others suffered severe frostbite, was the subject of Jon Krakauer’s best-selling book “Into Thin Air.”This movie, written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, tells a somewhat different version of the story, with Mr. Krakauer (Michael Kelly) as a marginal and not entirely sympathetic character. His participation in the climb as a writer working on an article for Outside magazine is part of the competition between Hall and Fischer. Both climbers crave the publicity a magazine feature would bring, even though Hall is also aware that such attention is contributing to dangerous and unpleasant conditions on the mountain.At one point, Krakauer asks members of Hall’s expedition why they are there, and though their answers are potted or evasive, “Everest” fills in some of the blanks. Beck Weathers, a gung-ho Texan played by Josh Brolin, eventually lets his bravado slip and admits that the malaise that plagues him in daily life dissipates in challenging conditions at high altitudes. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes), a quiet postal worker who has tried and failed to reach the top of Everest before, is seeking a fulfillment that eludes him elsewhere. Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori), the only woman in Hall’s group, has already climbed six of the seven highest mountains in the world, and needs Everest to complete the set.Mr. Kormakur, an Icelandic director whose films include “Jar City” and “2 Guns,” hits his stride once the preliminary conversations and expository scenes give way to practical decisions and perilous mishaps. As his camera swoops down on the climbers from above — and, on a few vertiginous occasions, from below — you feel some of the grandeur and terror of their undertaking. They are small, slow-moving creatures, their bright-colored gear vivid and incongruous amid the sparkling whites and swirling grays of snow, cloud and wind. Their progress is grueling and slow, but Mr. Kormakur generates suspense through deft crosscutting and an accelerating sense of doom.Down at the base camp, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), Hall’s business partner and a kind of den mother to his clients, keeps an eye on the weather and an ear on her two-way radio. From time to time, we peek in on Hall’s wife, Jan Arnold (Keira Knightley), who is pregnant with their first child, and on Peach Weathers (Robin Wright), who shares her husband’s bluff confidence until it’s time to start worrying.In telling its terrible true story, “Everest” gets stuck between celebrating the indomitability of the human spirit and reckoning with the awful consequences of hubris and bad luck. It aspires to something large and lofty, but in the end it’s a big pile of rocks, ice and vain and valiant human effort.“Everest” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Scarcity — of materials, of electricity, even of food — has been a condition of their creative lives. If we had money, one painting student says, maybe we wouldn’t be as interested in art.Short and sweet and limited, “Alumbrones” — it means little bursts of light, as when the electricity flickers on briefly during blackouts — is itself less interested in art than in these artists. And for good reason. They’re charming, insightful about life and art, and seemingly free of self-pity, with memorable faces and voices. By the end of the movie, they all feel a bit like pals.Mr. Donnelly isn’t much for context, though the artists provide some, talking about the “special period” in the 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union made material conditions in Cuba a disaster. One points out that without real access to the Internet, artists have scant ideas about trends beyond the island. Their art is influenced by other Cuban art, and the work we see bears this out.The film makes an odd, quick detour to Boston, where we’re told that artists need patrons and collectors, but we’re not introduced to any. The press notes solve this mystery: Most of the artists in this movie — who themselves aren’t named until the very end — are represented by Michelle Wojcik’s Galería Cubana in Boston, which Mr. Donnelly happened into once and which clearly shaped this film’s vision of Cuban art.

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘Dior and I,’ a Documentary That Peers Into a Storied Fashion House","An elegant and captivating piece of corporate promotion in the guise of a documentary, Frédéric Tcheng’s “Dior and I” unfolds like an episode of “Project Runway” with better clothes and bigger budgets, or perhaps a Christopher Guest movie without a sense of humor. There are some amusing moments, to be sure, and some touching ones as well, but the film is less interested in ideas or emotions than in illusions. It produces an aura of suspense without a sense of real risk, and offers devotees of fashion an appealing, shallow fantasy of inside knowledge.Early and late, Mr. Tcheng summons the specter of Christian Dior, who appears in archival footage accompanied by passages from his memoir (read by the poet Omar Berrada) that reflect on his double identity as an ordinary provincial Frenchman and as the name above the door of a storied Paris fashion house. Dior, whose 1947 New Look created some of the most enduring iconography of modern femininity, is invoked as a friendly ghost haunting the workshops and showrooms of his maison de couture, and as a benevolent patriarch devoted, above all, to the elegance of women. In 2012, when most of the film takes place, Dior’s legacy has been placed in the hands of Raf Simons, a Belgian designer recently hired from Jil Sander.Mr. Simons, Dior’s new artistic director, arrives in an atmosphere of nervous expectation, with just eight weeks to produce a couture collection to be shown at Paris Fashion Week. Best known for his men’s wear, he has a reputation as a minimalist — a characterization he disputes — that potentially makes him an odd fit with the company’s tradition of tasteful luxury. Introducing Mr. Simons to the white-coated staff of the workshops where the clothes will be made, his boss notes with evident mixed feelings that the house is “modernizing.” Mr. Simons, who favors dark sweaters and open-necked shirts over silk ties and elegantly cut suits, also prefers to be addressed by his first name.“Dior and I” is itself a sign of the times, in which transparency is the new mystique. An audience that once might have savored the mysteries of craft now feasts on the spectacle of process. We demand to see how the sausages — or in this case the dresses, but also the dances, the plays and the movies themselves — are made.A documentary style has arisen to answer this hunger that splits the difference between cinéma vérité and reality television, engendering films that often feel like CliffsNotes versions of Frederick Wiseman’s dense, slow moving institutional studies. Like “Ballet 422,” Jody Lee Lipes’s recent film about the choreographer Justin Peck, “Dior and I” generates momentum and interest by showing deadline-driven creative work. In both cases, there is a counterpoint of individual vision and collaborative labor. Mr. Simons, assisted by his longtime collaborator Pieter Mulier, delves into contemporary art and Dior’s history in search of inspiration. Shy, morose and unable to speak French, Mr. Simons sometimes has trouble communicating with the women who run the workshops, who view him with skepticism. The two premières, Florence Chehet and Monique Bailly, who preside over teams of white-coated cutters and seamstresses (one for dresses, the other for suits), are by far the most fascinating figures in “Dior and I.” They are a study in temperamental contrasts — Ms. Chehet warm and bubbly, Ms. Bailly anxious and astringent — and also exemplars of loyal service and artisanal pride. Ultimately, though, they are treated with condescension, by the attention-seeking, hype-driven industry that employs them and by a film that uncritically embraces the values of that industry. Access to an institution like the house of Dior is a rare and precious thing, and Mr. Tcheng has paid for it with a flattering portrait dressed up to look like cleareyed scrutiny. The emperor’s clothes are beautiful, as you always knew they would be.",0,,,0
774,2016-09-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:25,MANOHLA DARGIS,"Review: In ‘Miss Peregrine’s Home,’ Chasing Grandpa’s Stories Down a Rabbit Hole","The movies have long made room for phantasmagoric visionaries, the strange ones, the different ones, who like to peek under rocks (or peel back the skin) to peer at what squirms beneath. Fitting their deliriums into bright, shiny, commercially palatable vehicles can be difficult, as Tim Burton’s career attests. Time and again, Mr. Burton has tried to smooth down his singular art, rather like one of Cinderella’s stepsisters sawing off a bit of her foot to squeeze into a happily-ever-after slipper. Mr. Burton should never hack off his strange bits; they can be glorious.Ah, but he slips beautifully into his latest, “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children.” Based on the book of the same title in the young-adult series by Ransom Riggs, it follows the curious and curiouser adventures of Jake (Asa Butterfield), a Florida adolescent who’s begun to wither in all that tedious sunshine. The only beguiling shadow in an otherwise terrifyingly pastel life is his grandfather, Abe (Terence Stamp). Raconteur or fabulist, Abe likes to amble down a twisting memory lane, telling tales about the monsters he fought in the war or the children’s home in Wales where bees buzzed in a boy’s head and a girl named Emma (Ella Purnell) floated as light as a leaf on the wind.This is all nonsense except that it’s not, though, you know, all in good time. First, Mr. Burton has to wind up the story and dispense with the usual preliminaries, the introductions and scene-setting, which he manages nicely. Some of this is dreary (the parents), some less so, particularly the skipping between past and present — a foreshadowing of later time traveling — which begins with a very young Jake listening to Abe in wonderment and ends with Jake as a squirmy, awkward teenager (like a super-abridged take on Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood”). And while Mr. Stamp seems eccentrically cast, his coolness works here because distance invariably draws you in closer.It takes a while for Mr. Burton to get his kink on. Although he has some fun setting up Jake’s juvenile detention (i.e., life), the story begins to sag almost before it’s begun, despite the time-skipping and peekaboo at the mysteries to come. There’s a brief, amusing party scene at Jake’s house that suggests who he — and Mr. Burton — believe are the real monsters. But the movie also needlessly dawdles when it climbs on a high horse as Jake, after delivering a school presentation on his grandfather, is mocked and cruelly told that Abe lies. As if anyone, especially anyone watching a Hollywood movie, needed reminding that some people will always try to snuff out creativity.Eventually, after the parts are snapped into place and well-oiled, Jake and his rather more reluctant father, Frank (a tamped-down Chris O’Dowd), arrive in Wales, chasing down Abe’s legacy and stories. While his father dithers and drinks, Jake goes down the rabbit hole and lands in a time loop where Miss Peregrine (a delightful Eva Green), welcomes him to 1943 with mad eyes and a Sherlock-sized pipe that she likes to clench between her pretty teeth. And we’re off, having finally arrived in an otherworldly fantasy that’s been etched with meticulous loveliness, from the meringue peaks of Miss Peregrine’s black-and-blue hair to the vaguely vaginal apertures in her jacket sleeves.Miss Peregrine’s home — its inhabitants, chambers and time-stuttering enigmas — turns out to be a delightful cabinet of curiosities, those wonder rooms in which (once upon a time before Instagram) collectors stashed marvels like body parts, scientific instruments, odds and ends. Movies are kind of wonder rooms, too, though much depends on the collector. Mr. Burton, whose artistry is at times most evident in its filigree, can be a great collector when given the right box to fill, as is the case here. He revels in the story’s icky, freaky stuff; he’s right at home, which may be why he seems liberated by its labyrinthine turns and why you don’t care if you get a little lost in them.Once Jake starts hanging out with his new crew, a charming sideshow — the girl with the gobbling mouth in the back of her head, the boy with prophetic gifts — he proves to be somewhat of a dullard. (The children are ideally cast, even if one is playing an invisible boy and two others are obscured by delectably creepy masks.) This isn’t Mr. Butterfield’s fault, just the fate of the hero who has to serve as the intermediary between the world of the spectator and the world on the other side of the looking glass. With his lanky limbs as well as his dark hair and clothes, Mr. Butterfield can’t help but bring to mind Mr. Burton, who of course plays the same role for us.The story gets awfully busy — you may get lost in 1943 or perhaps closer to the present — but it scarcely matters. Mr. Burton’s attention to detail and to the ebb and flow of tone (scary, funny, eerie), as well as his sensitive, gentle work particularly with the child actors, make each new turn another occasion for unfettered imagination. As time loops and eyeballs pop and Samuel L. Jackson shows up as a villain and then Judi Dench drops in for a while, the movie holds you tight with one after another marvelous, horrible, indelible vision. Here, women turn into birds and a boy holds a rope tied to the waist of a girl who, in turn, floats above him like a balloon, a thought and a dream.“Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). For once, the rating makes sense given that there are scenes, including with eyeballs, that may be too intense for young children. Running time: 2 hours 7 minutes.",1,,,0

SCOTT,A Dying Village Gets a Curious Visitor,"A neorealist ghost story, a documentary fable, a postcard from a vanishing world, Julia Murat’s “Found Memories” takes place in Jotuomba, a tiny, fictitious rural village in northern Brazil. To call Jotuomba a place that time forgot would be less a cliché than an accurate description, since the aging, dwindling population — a quarrelsome pair of shopkeepers, a haggard priest, an assortment of idle agricultural workers and dedicated drinkers — seems to exist beyond the reach of modernity.Until, that is, a young photographer (Lisa E. Fávero) shows up, hoping to document the experiences and surroundings of these people, whose way of life has been consigned to oblivion in the wake of Brazil’s rapid development. They treat her with a combination of wariness and cordiality, and over time her curiosity deepens into something stranger and more intense.Like her protagonist Ms. Murat is an unobtrusive observer with a strong and confident visual sense. The drama in “Found Memories” is subdued, sometimes almost invisible, but it moves with quiet assurance toward a startling conclusion. Its clever final plot twist adds a gratifying jolt of the uncanny to what is otherwise a charming, bittersweet meditation on the passage of time and the equivocal power of images to capture an older world at the moment of its disappearance.",0,5175.0,,0

The “Paris” crew, made up largely of black and Hispanic transgender women and drag performers, took its outlandish ballroom competitions from Harlem to Times Square and the Village, jolting the pop culture of the time. It also chronicled their individual struggles to survive.More than 25 years later, “Kiki,” a new documentary directed by the Swedish filmmaker Sara Jordeno (and credited as a film by Ms. Jordeno and Twiggy Pucci Garçon), explores the contemporary Harlem gay and transgender scene. Yet the absence of elder mentors is sadly conspicuous. It’s possible that many, maybe most, of that earlier generation is no longer with us.People who live outside of the places where the AIDS crisis hit hardest tend to mistakenly believe that it’s under control. “Kiki,” a spiritual descendant of Ms. Livingston’s film, implicitly insists the devastation that H.I.V. and AIDS wrought persists. As a partial result, the queer and transgender teenagers of the post-ballroom culture, which they call the “Kiki scene,” have, it seems, only themselves to rely on. Even those who have at least one supportive parent, as Mr. Pucci Garçon does, carry a kind of visual loneliness despite their ability to strike a pose.And the poses are fierce, though here they are struck in various makeshift spaces — high school gymnasiums, it appears at times, rather than ballrooms. The kids frequently trek from Harlem to the Christopher Street pier, where they marvel at what they perceive to be the blatant homophobia of the police officers in this relatively gay-friendly neighborhood. The semiotics of the scene are as complex as those of the last generation who hosted the dance balls. As one (unofficial) ball competition coach advises about another performer’s stance, “No one can tell you what you’re not, because you’re real,” with the last word in a set of inflected quotation marks.Ms. Jordeno chronicled her tight-knit group for several years, and was able to document two of her subjects, Gia Marie Love and Izana Vidal, at various stages of their transitioning to women. These are tough but tenderhearted young people who speak frankly about their various challenges, including the lure of sex work — relatively easy money in a world that still doesn’t much like seeing trans people working “straight” jobs.One subject, speaking of trying in his early teens to come to grips with discovering that he was gay, says: “I thought, no, that can’t be possible. It’s not true.” American society is full of people who shrug off the struggles of such individuals as “lifestyle choices,” and the current sociopolitical climate is inarguably actively encouraging a backlash in transgender tolerance. “Kiki” shows us a group of brave and beautiful souls for whom the struggle is, unfortunately, probably about to get even harder.",0,,,0

Her movies are frothy, playful, homogeneous, routinely maddening and generally pretty irresistible even when they’re not all that good. Her most notable visual signature is the immaculate, luxuriously appointed interiors she’s known to fuss over personally — they inevitably feature throw pillows that look as if they’ve been arranged with a measuring tape. These interiors are fetishized by moviegoers and Architectural Digest alike, ready-made for Pinterest and comment threads peppered with questions like, “Where do I get that hat?”In her latest, Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower who shakes up his life when he becomes an intern at a web start-up where he soon becomes an office mascot and geezer Tinker Bell. Mostly, though, Ben is the benign face of patriarchy, a gentler, kinder father figure who comes equipped with a laundered handkerchief and the wisdom of the elders. He shares both with his new boss, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the founder of an online clothing site that has rocketed from zero to zillions in record time. She runs her company with a steely grip and a forced smile in a refurbished Brooklyn warehouse the size of Grand Central Terminal. She’s a success and possibly an obsessive-compulsive (she all but showers in hand sanitizer), but she’s also floundering, one crisis at a time.Jules’s problem is as familiar as the last headline that recycled the plagues of career women who want it all, apparently can’t have it all and are unsure if they want any of it in the first place. “What do women want,” Forbes asked a few years ago, echoing (still!) Dr. Freud. Among the suggestions: a little sadomasochistic me time à la “Fifty Shades of Grey.” For her part, Jules mostly wants someone to tidy up a cluttered table that sits like a reproach in the middle of the immaculate office and that for some reason she won’t or can’t tell someone to clean. Structurally, the messy table is a means for Ben, the ultimate can-do type whom Jules doesn’t want to engage, to at last catch her attention. And he does just that when he clears it, inaugurating a work relationship that soon turns into a friendship.The table is a silly, lazy screenwriting contrivance, and it says more about Ms. Meyers’s conflicted ideas about powerful women than it conveys anything interesting about Jules. A successful Hollywood director like Ms. Meyers, for starters, would never have gotten this far and with a number of hits to her name if she had been afraid of telling other people what to do. But Ms. Meyers has some distinct ideas about women, work and power, and so she piles on the issues: Jules is chronically late to meetings, among other sins, although that seems to be because she likes riding slowly through the office on her bicycle. The bike suggests that she’s a nonconformist, although the neat rows of her pretty, young, overwhelmingly white employees doing something in front of their computers suggest otherwise.Ben serves as a kind of Mr. Fix-It, who, with quiet confidence, paternal competence and a driver’s license, helps Jules get on track at work and home in the way that none of the man-children in her life can. Ms. Meyers has clearly been binging on Judd Apatow comedies, and she stacks her movie with assorted bromantic schlumps (including a troika that functions like a farm team version of Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera), whose sloppy clothes and facial hair emblematize not only their arrested development but also a crisis in masculinity. That guys like these help run the world (and the entertainment business) without hauling around a leather briefcase is immaterial to Ms. Meyers, presumably because it would get in the way of her new take on the rescue narrative.Ben doesn’t sweep up the damsel like Daniel Day-Lewis in “The Last of the Mohicans,” but he proves more than up to the task. Ms. Meyers’s script makes sure that’s the case, as does the smartest choice she makes in “The Intern”: Mr. De Niro, her loosest, most valuable player. Long celebrated for his vein-popping intensity, Mr. De Niro has been yukking it up in comedy since the 1960s. Part of what distinguishes his later laugh-ins is that they’re inextricably haunted by the ghost of Travis Bickle and sometimes — as when Mr. De Niro breaks out his terrifying ear-to-ear Soupy Sales grin — Rupert Pupkin, his nut job from “The King of Comedy.” However straight his character, he can’t help but be a destabilizing force, which is crucial when a movie is as hermetically sealed as “The Intern.”Ms. Hathaway, who’s regularly forced to take Jules’s inner girl out for a sniffle and a sob, does her best, but it’s hopeless. Jules is less of a character and more of a fast-walking, speed-talking collection of gender grievances, some of which originate with a squirmy house husband Matt (Anders Holm). One look at that guy’s smile and you want Mr. De Niro to wipe it off. He doesn’t, but there’s no need to because Mr. De Niro owns the movie from the moment he opens his mouth, and is staring into the camera and right at you. (Oh, yes, he’s lookin’ at you.) You can’t look away, and soon you don’t want to. Certainly Ms. Meyers doesn’t want anyone to because, though she loves the idea of the successful, independent woman, she also ardently wants to make room for daddy.“The Intern” is rated PG-13.

Its subject, Christina Noble, is an Irish children’s rights activist and writer, who traveled to Ho Chi Minh City in 1989 and established a foundation that has set up more than 100 projects in Vietnam and Mongolia that provide protection, education and health care for more than 700,000 children and their families.As the movie tells it, television coverage of the Vietnam War inspired visionary nightmares that led Christina to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, where the plight of orphaned, homeless children squatting in abandoned buildings drove her to take action. Her efforts to help them were repeatedly thwarted by indifferent officials. Threatened with deportation, she was given three months to secure sponsorship for a program to help the children. In many ways, “Noble” is a standard tale of one tenacious individual’s determination to make a difference. And in bluntly connecting Christina’s campaign with her own nightmarish childhood in late-1940s and ’50s Dublin, the movie partly avoids the sticky sentimentality of the typical do-gooder film portrait. High-spirited and rebellious from a young age, she dreamed of a singing career like her idol Doris Day. She also had conversations with God. When her alcoholic father couldn’t keep the family together, the children were distributed to various institutions. Christina landed in a school run by nuns where she was treated harshly. Even after she was viciously raped and the son she bore sent away, her spirit was not broken.Christina overcomes misfortune by fighting back. When she marries, you imagine she has found deliverance. But no; her husband is violently abusive. As the movie tells it, everything she achieves is accomplished almost single-handedly. She had to browbeat most of her allies, including one played by Brendan Coyle of “Downton Abbey” fame, into embracing her cause.The movie rather confusedly jumps around in time with flashbacks to this or that turning point. The seemingly random time-scrambling at least lends Christina’s story some consistency by reminding you of the hardships she overcame. Ms. O’Kane’s brusque performance portrays Christina as a woman who acts on her principles and has little time for making nice. She is a compelling embodiment of the adage “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” “Noble” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence and sexual situations.",0,347321.0,,0
779,2008-04-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:07,A. O. SCOTT,"Two Buddies, Several Tokes Over the Line","If you think the last seven years have been one long, dumb, dirty joke — or maybe if, sometimes, you just wish you could believe as much — then “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay,” written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, just might be the perfect movie for you. That it is, quite unapologetically, far from perfect in every respect almost doesn’t matter. The simple fact that a movie exists with the title “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” is cause for hope. Or maybe for alarm. In any case, for a few laughs.Be warned that some of these are fairly cheap and crude, involving the standard motifs of R-rated male comedy: excrement, leering sexual aggression, hysterical sexual insecurity and drug use. Not much new ground is broken in this department, which doesn’t mean that the jokes themselves aren’t funny.The idea of gay sex induces panic; the sight of unclothed female flesh causes jaws to go slack; and in a crisis someone is sure to whip out a joint. (I won’t spoil any surprises by saying just who.) At one point the movie’s titular heroes drop in on a friend who’s having a “bottomless” party at which there seem to be only female guests, and the movie loses some credibility when it declines to show the full extent of its stars’ eventual participation in the festivities. Dudes, if the dude in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” could put his business up on the screen, then so can you. It’s a whole new world.But in other, more significant ways, the “Harold & Kumar” movies, of which this is the second (after the immortal “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle”) and I hope not the last, go further than most stoner raunch comedies in acknowledging certain realities of contemporary American life.The simplest innovation, but also in a way the most radical, lies in Harold and Kumar themselves. Played by John Cho (he’s Harold Lee, the Korean-American investment banker) and Kal Penn (he’s Kumar Patel, the Indian-American would-be medical student), they are a postcollegiate multicultural odd couple in a world where ignorance and prejudice do battle with hypersensitivity and political correctness. They are at once nerdy achievers caught in the gears of meritocracy and stoner rebels against the machine. In their exasperated, half-baked (or, in the reefer-mad Kumar’s case, fully baked) way, these representative men mock all sides.And just about everything else too. Their first adventure, four years ago, was simple and aspirational: they had the munchies and they wanted some burgers. But now times have changed, even though it is only a few days later in screen time. Paranoia is no longer an occasional, bong-induced side effect, but rather standard operating procedure at the highest levels of government.Well, sort of. When Kumar is asked to step aside for a random security check at the airport, he blusters about ethnic profiling, which it turns out is less a matter of righteous outrage than an attempt to distract the security agents from finding the marijuana in his underwear. He and Harold are going to Amsterdam to find Maria (Paula Garces), the new love in Harold’s life, but rather than wait until they land in that paradise of legal vice, Kumar tries to fire up the pipe in the lavatory at 30,000 feet.To their fellow passengers Kumar’s bong looks like a bomb, and to a zealous Homeland Security bureaucrat (Rob Corddry), its discovery exposes a terrorist conspiracy between Al Qaeda and North Korea. And so into United States custody, and then, post-escape, on another stoner road trip, to Texas, where Kumar’s college sweetheart, Vanessa (Danneel Harris), is about to marry a well-connected prepster named Colton (Eric Winter). On the way they meet people who challenge some stereotypes and confirm others, and they also, in a sublime pop-cultural in-joke carried over from the trip to White Castle, hook up with the great Neil Patrick Harris.“Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” offers a shambling series of hit-and-miss goofs, rather than incisive satire directed at Bush-era America. That is the job of Mr. Corddry’s erstwhile “Daily Show” colleagues Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Mr. Hurwitz and Mr. Schlossberg (who wrote but did not direct “White Castle”) instead rely on a general sense of good-humored exasperation that never reaches the boiling point of political indignation.But precisely because their attitudes are so bluntly hedonistic and apolitical, Harold and Kumar manage to be fairly persuasive when they get around to criticizing the status quo, which the movie has the wit to acknowledge itself as part of.“It’s people like you who make the rest of the world think Americans are stupid. But we’re not stupid, and we’re not going to take this anymore.” These lines are  spoken by an exasperated government official, and they could, I suppose, be directed at the makers and stars of “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.” But they’re not stupid, and to the extent that the movie is, its idiocy serves the cause of good sense and intelligence. And no, I’m not smoking anything.“Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has foul language, drug use and gratuitous nudity.HAROLD & KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAYOpens on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg; director of photography, Daryn Okada; edited by Jeff Freeman; music by George S.

780,2011-10-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,MANOHLA DARGIS,Horrors of a Coming War Painted in a 1935 Meeting,"On July 17, 1935, The New York Times published a statement by Varian Fry in which that young American, the editor of Living Age magazine, described anti-Jewish rioting that had taken place in Berlin two nights earlier. His account was horrific, and not only because of what it foreshadowed: ordinary Germans joining Nazi thugs in what he characterized as a “holiday mood” of bloody anti-Semitic violence. “Old men and young men,” Fry wrote, “boys, Storm Troops, police, young girls of the domestic servant type, well-bred women, some even in the forties and over — all seemed to be having a good time.”This dispatch was followed by a second, similarly haunting report some days later, also published in The Times. After the rioting, Fry had visited Ernst Franz Sedgwick Hanfstaengl, then a Hitler press adviser. Hanfstaengl and Fry were Harvard men, which may help to explain why the adviser was so free with his words. He told Fry that it had been storm troopers, not Jews, who had hissed a Swedish film, heckling that had been blamed for causing the rioting. (Fry didn’t identify the film, but it was the anti-Semitic comedy “Pettersson & Bendel,” which was released in Germany in July 1935 and, according to Rochelle Wright’s book on Swedish film, “The Visible Wall,” was seen by Hitler as a propaganda tool.)More chilling was Fry’s account of the future that, with breathtaking casualness, Hanfstaengl painted during their meeting. “Mr. Fry,” the article stated, “said that in his talk with Mr. Hanfstaengl he was told that there were two anti-Semitic groups, one the radical section that desired to solve the Jewish question with bloodshed and the other a moderate group that wished to segregate the Jews by law into a specified area.”This seems to be the only time that the two men met. (Hanfstaengl, called Putzi, graduated from Harvard in 1909, while Fry graduated in 1931.) Their 1935 encounter, as well as the very different men they were and the actions they took during World War II, appears to have been what spurred Richard Kaplan to tackle their lives and histories in his documentary “Varian and Putzi: A 20th Century Tale.” Certainly each man’s story has its pull, Fry’s especially. In 1940 he returned to Europe to work for an organization that had been set up in France to rescue Jews. He only had 200 legal visas, but he helped 2,000 to escape, including Marc Chagall, Hannah Arendt, André Breton and the film theorist Siegfried Kracauer.Hanfstaengl, by contrast, largely comes across as one of history’s fools, a Hitler toady (and pianist), who, according to William L. Shirer (“The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich”), was popular despite his “clownish stupidity.” (Josef Goebbels didn’t like Hanfstaengl, and, in 1937, he fled, landing in the United States where he supplied gossip about Hitler’s sex life to the American government. He died in 1975.) Alas, Putzi receives as much attention as Varian, who died in 1967 and in 1994 was given the title Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.At a too-brief 80 minutes, this documentary can only dilute each man’s story, both the subject of various books. Particularly unfortunate is Mr. Kaplan’s insistent, obfuscating oscillation between their histories, a strategy that prevents him from getting a grip on either.VARIAN AND PUTZIA 20th Century TaleOpens on Saturday in Manhattan.Directed by Richard Kaplan; written by Christina Lazaridi and Mr. Kaplan; director of photography, Peter Stein; edited by Jared Dubrino and Babak Rassi; produced by Mr. Kaplan and Catherine Tambini.

Did I say risible? At the screening I attended, that threat prompted hoots of derisive laughter, as did other howlers, including, “I’m not dying here; there’s a bomb in the oven.”A joke? Oh, if only.Directed by John Singleton (“Four Brothers,” “2 Fast 2 Furious”), from a screenplay by Shawn Christensen, “Abduction” is a sloppy, exploitative act of star worship created (if that’s the right word for cynical hackwork) around Mr. Lautner, the pouty 19-year-old heartthrob of the “Twilight” franchise. The camera swoons around him as if he were a priceless sculpture, often moving in for extreme close-ups. The movie stops in its tracks long enough to ogle an extended smooch whose slurping seems scientifically calculated to take things to the brink of an R rating.To give Mr. Lautner his due, he is a martial-arts dervish with perfectly sculptured abs. His acting, however, is another matter. I can’t recall another teenage star so opaque. If his physiognomy — recessed eyes that don’t seem to focus, a wide snub nose and Elvis-y lips — conjure Neanderthal manhood after a cosmetic makeover, his boyish monotone with its utter lack of inflection suggests that he is really an advanced robot simulating human speech without registering emotion or even comprehension.Throughout most of the movie, Nathan is on the run with his across-the-street neighbor and high-school classmate Karen (Lily Collins), who, like Nathan, loses her sultry mystique once she opens her mouth. They are pursued by two small armies, one made up of C.I.A. officers, the other of Eastern European goons, who finally clash at a Pittsburgh Pirates game; both sides are desperately searching for a list of spies encrypted in a cellphone that landed in Nathan’s hands.Don’t ask about the whys and wherefores; I doubt whether even the screenwriter could tell you. Reputable actors like Alfred Molina, Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello are on hand, but they can’t paper over the fatuity of the two leads and the screenplay’s gaping holes.The trouble begins when Nathan comes across a photograph of his 3 1/2-year-old self on a missing-children Web site, a cyber fishing expedition that directs the baddies to his home, where they storm the place and kill his parents minutes after he discovers he is not their biological son. As a mad chase ensues, “Abduction” stokes the illusion that Nathan is suddenly the most important person in the world. Any self-centered teenager can identify with that.“Abduction” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has extreme violence.ABDUCTIONOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by John Singleton; written by Shawn Christensen; director of photography, Peter Menzies Jr.; edited by Bruce Cannon; music by Edward Shearmur; production design by Keith Brian Burns; costumes by Ruth Carter; produced by Doug Davison, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Lee Stollman, Roy Lee, Dan Lautner and Pat Crowley; released by Lionsgate.

782,2016-11-23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:26,STEPHEN HOLDEN,Review: ‘Rules Don’t Apply’ Features Warren Beatty as Howard Hughes,"It may be hyperbolic to describe Warren Beatty’s Howard Hughes movie, “Rules Don’t Apply,” as a screwball “Citizen Kane.” But that’s what it feels like. From another perspective, this serio-comic portrait of Hughes, the aeronautics mogul, movie producer and marathon womanizer, might also be a satirical cartoon that emphasizes his similarities to Donald J. Trump. Why else would Mr. Beatty name a fictional aspiring singer and actress who comes into Hughes’s orbit Marla Mabrey?If you survey Mr. Beatty’s work, everything seems intentional. He has always been a stickler for details, right down to the new film’s witty opening disclaimer: “Never check an interesting fact,” a quotation ascribed to Hughes.In his 1998 comedy, “Bulworth,” Mr. Beatty reinvented himself as a truth-spouting politician disseminating his liberal message in the language of rap: a vocabulary that, as wielded by Mr. Beatty, rang as simultaneously ridiculous and pointedly articulate. And in the smart, hugely entertaining “Rules Don’t Apply,” Mr. Beatty expands his absurdist vision of politics and show business to take in Hollywood, where he has reigned as an enigmatic glamour boy turned statesman with serious talent for nearly 60 years.Who else is better equipped to understand the symbiosis between show business and politics and to assert that when a certain degree of wealth and power have been achieved, the ordinary rules of human behavior can be flouted? It’s almost a law of celebrity that given such stimulation, egos tend to inflate to gargantuan size. Hollywood teems with pompous self-appointed kings ruling their fiefs as they see fit.I would also suggest that “Rules Don’t Apply” is a deeply personal film: a self-deflating autobiographical critique by Mr. Beatty, 79, arriving at a moment when he may realize that he has little left to protect and is free to portray the hypercompetitive Hollywood game as a nonsensical joke.Hughes’s obsession with control, secrecy and beautiful women are qualities reflected in Mr. Beatty’s past behavior. Probably no one in Hollywood is the repository of so much gossip. Does anyone else know more about how the intersection of show business power brokers and politicians actually operates? How could someone with so much knowledge gleaned over decades not come to regard the circus with an amused cynicism? Mr. Beatty’s Hughes has his moments of monstrous egotism, but conveys a sly self-awareness even when Hughes’s battiest behavior leaves those around him visibly cringing.The wonder of the movie, which Mr. Beatty wrote and directed from a story he wrote with Bo Goldman, is that it is so good-humored. Fools and idiots abound, but demonic, systemic evil does not. Mr. Beatty obviously loves Hollywood, which has been good to him. The movie’s shots of Los Angeles thoroughfares in the ’50s and ’60s exert a nostalgic tug. That the actress playing Marla, Lily Collins, is a virtual look-alike of the teenage Elizabeth Taylor, is no accident.The story begins in 1964 as television reporters gather for a rare telephone news conference with Hughes. This was around the time that the reclusive billionaire, then in his late 50s, was growing increasingly eccentric.The movie then jumps back six years to the arrival in Los Angeles of Marla, an aspiring starlet under contract to Hughes, and her strict Baptist mother, Lucy (Annette Bening). The mouthy and aggressive Marla expects to be screen-tested but, to her frustration, finds herself one of 26 young women in a pool of impatient hopefuls all waiting for a turn.Marla is assigned a handsome young driver, Frank Forbes (Alden Ehrenreich, from “Hail, Caesar!”), and their attraction is instantaneous. Mr. Beatty is old enough to remember the suffocating puritanical atmosphere of the ’50s, and this movie’s portrayal of bygone courtship rituals is dryly comedic. Marla refers to herself as “the virgin Baptist.” A comic high point of the movie is a messy sexual accident played for farce.When Hughes finally appears, peering anxiously from behind a curtain, he is already in the throes of paranoia and a worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder. He repeats the same phrase over and over, secretly records his conversations, and, in the funniest bit, demands a huge delivery of his favorite ice cream, banana-nut, then forgets about it.“Rules Don’t Apply” is strewn with celebrity cameos. Two of the brightest turns are by Candice Bergen as Hughes’s patient secretary, Nadine, and Matthew Broderick playing Hughes’s chief driver and Frank’s boss, Levar Mathis, as a flunky who when not rolling his eyes, wears a glazed, deer-in-the-headlights expression.Mr. Beatty’s film methodically steers away from high drama. A plane crash in which Hughes was seriously injured is passed over as if it were nothing. The love story at the film’s heart is more comical than erotic. The closest thing to a message that “Rules Don’t Apply” imparts — that the slavish sycophants bowing and scraping before their master enable his insanity — is hardly new.Below the movie’s screwball shenanigans is a core of romanticism signaled in its soundtrack. Silly vintage pop tunes heard early in the film eventually give way to recurrent use of the Adagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony, the same melancholy theme heard in Luchino Visconti’s “Death in Venice.” Though wildly overused in “Rules Don’t Apply,” the Adagietto feels like an aging Hollywood monarch’s nostalgic lament for a place that no longer exists.“Rules Don’t Apply” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sexual material, brief strong language and drug references.

This light, disposable soufflé from Daniel Cohen at times suggests “Ratatouille” with humans. For a film about mouthwatering cuisine, it offers only fleeting delectable sensations.The hero is Jacky (Michaël Youn), an aspiring chef who can’t keep a gig because he has no patience for his customers’ dining habits. After his pregnant girlfriend (Raphaëlle Agogue) puts her foot down, Jacky takes a job painting a retirement home, but sneaks away to compose lavish meals for its residents.There he’s discovered by his idol, Alexandre Lagarde (Jean Reno), a revered but increasingly passé culinarian and TV personality who is about to be fired from his restaurant. The owner (Julien Boisselier) insists that he use cheaper, chemical-laden ingredients.“Le Chef” is primarily an odd-couple farce, as the stern, micromanaging Alexandre takes the authority-flouting Jacky under his wing. The film rises to the defense of what might be called classical French values, celebrating romance, steak frites and the neighborhood grocer in an era it sees as superficially impressed by iPad menus and molecular gastronomy.Mr. Cohen gets some laughs from the Mad Libs quality of modern cooking. (Santiago Segura plays a Spanish chef who experiments with liquid nitrogen and “fragmentation of duck.”) But the movie’s cultural conservatism also manifests as ethnocentrism. In a cringingly unfunny interlude, Jacky and Alexandre disguise themselves as Japanese tourists to spy on a rival. The scene leaves a sour taste.“Le Chef” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

These are a few of the ghosts who haunt Los Angeles, that Mecca of Fabulousness where you can go for weeks (and invariably by car) without smelling the reek of other people’s desperation. That helps explain why Hollywood types tend not to set their camera sights on homeless men, women and children, unless they’re good for a little uplift (as in the Will Smith vehicle “The Pursuit of Happyness”). Homeless people are generally, pardon the pun, bummers —they also can’t afford tickets.Based on a book by the Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez,  “The Soloist” recounts what happened when one of the city’s more privileged denizens  (Robert Downey Jr. as the newsman) met one of its least fortunate (Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers). A Juilliard dropout, Mr. Ayers ended up on the streets, where he pushed a shopping cart filled with trash and bedded down next to rats. This isn’t a milieu in which you might expect to find the British director Joe Wright, last seen exploring class and other catastrophes in “Atonement.” Yet he fits fine with “The Soloist,” perhaps because he brings an outsider’s perspective to the material or is just accustomed to navigating the divide between the haves and have-nots.Polished to a high gleam by Mr. Wright and written by Susannah Grant (whose credits include “In Her Shoes”), the film is imperfect, periodically if unsurprisingly sentimental, overly tidy and often very moving. It works hard to make you feel good, as is to be expected, even as it maintains a strong sense of moral indignation that comes close to an assertion of real politics. Outrage would be too much for a mainstream entertainment like this one to manage. Like its muckraking journalist guide, it exploits its subjects for its own purposes.  But its commitment to the material feels honest, nowhere more so than in Mr. Downey’s darkly shaded, nuanced performance, one that deepens this film with its insistence on the fundamental mysteries of human character.It’s no surprise when  Lopez, taking a break from the newsroom roar, stops to listen to a disheveled man playing a two-stringed violin. In journalistic fashion, wonderment morphs into curiosity and then dogged pursuit as he quickly grasps that he’s discovered the makings of a great story. Although Lopez cooks up a column soon after they meet, the full account of how Ayers went from a happy childhood in Cleveland to bright promise in New York and then to his Los Angeles hell emerges through seamlessly interspersed, economical flashbacks. Lightly tinted, as is often customary in movies that return to the past (it’s as if happy childhoods were bathed in honey), the flashbacks are pieces of a puzzle that Lopez becomes increasingly hesitant to solve.It is, he discovers, difficult to deal with people in pain. Although they meet cute in the shadow of a looming statue of Beethoven (dedicated to the founder of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra),  the journalist and his story don’t settle into predictability, largely because Ayers is intrinsically volatile. Given to verbose bursts and abrupt silences, he doesn’t so much talk to Lopez (he doesn’t always make eye contact either) as just talk and talk, the words pouring out like water until something (rage? fear? chemistry?) stops the flow. Mr. Foxx often seems uncomfortable in his role, wavering between pathos and something harder and truer, but his scatlike delivery of some of Ayers’s twisting ropes of words can be mesmerizing.In Los Angeles homeless people are more likely to get sunburns than die freezing in the streets. Because of the city’s sprawl and dependence on automobiles, they also tend to be less visible than they are in more geographically compressed urban areas like Manhattan. In 2005, the year Mr. Lopez wrote his first column about Mr. Ayers, an estimated 8,000 to 11,000 were living in a 50-block skid row downtown, not far from the Los Angeles Times building, City Hall and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Frank Gehry-designed music center that sits on a hill like an enormous silvery flower far from the reach of the Nathaniel Ayerses of this world.Over the course of “The Soloist,” Lopez helps Ayers reconnect with his music and, in tentative fashion, a more dignified way of living in the world. There are triumphs and setbacks, but these arrive fairly quietly, with none of the 101 weeping strings that often come with stories as emotionally fraught as this one (though Beethoven does shake the speakers).  Helping someone off the streets is no small thing, but the story of one man is just that: the story of a single individual, a point that Mr. Wright underscores repeatedly. Again and again the film plunges into the streets, diving into a brackish humanity only to then drift amid the lost and forgotten. In the restrained voice-over that wends through the film, Lopez gives witness to what he has seen.“The Soloist” wouldn’t work half as well without Mr. Downey’s astringent, bristly take on a man whose best intentions eventually collide with difficult truths. The actor is a wonder,  but he has solid support from Catherine Keener as Lopez’s former wife and editor and Nelsan Ellis as a counselor working in the skid row trenches. Both characters exist mostly to push back at Lopez: they wag an occasional finger and dole out tough love and advice. Mr. Wright might be tempted to indulge in lofty symbolism (there are some unfortunately high-flying pigeons), but these three actors, along with the homeless people who worked as extras, help keep him tethered closer to the ground. It’s amazing what you can see when you get out of your car and walk: other people, for starters.“The Soloist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There’s nothing here that a 13-year-old hasn’t heard.THE SOLOISTOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Joe Wright; written by Susannah Grant, based on the book by Steve Lopez; director of photography, Seamus McGarvey; edited by Paul Tothill; music by Dario Marianelli; production designer, Sarah Greenwood; produced by Gary Foster and Russ Krasnoff; released by DreamWorks Pictures, Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures.

New Yorkers whose children attend schools with enrollments larger than Barjac’s population (1,400) might wonder how well it would work here. It’s easier to devote three hours to preparing fresh bone marrow when you’re serving only 200 meals a day (and when the students will actually eat bone marrow).“Food Beware” takes a pragmatic, health-based approach, buttressed by frightening statistics about cancer rates among children, that’s a refreshing change from the moral and high-cultural preening that sometimes enter this debate in America. In France, environmentalism has its own pop anthem — “Aux Arbres Citoyens,” Yannick Noah’s ecological “Marseillaise” — and the children of Barjac will sing it at the drop of a baguette.FOOD BEWAREThe French Organic RevolutionOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Jean-Paul Jaud; edited by Isabelle Szumny; music by Gabriel Yared; produced by Mr. Jaud and Béatrice Jaud; released by First Run Features.

O. SCOTT,A Harsh Hello for Visitors From Space,"For decades — at least since Orson Welles scared the daylights out of radio listeners with “War of the Worlds” back in 1938 — the public has embraced the terrifying prospect of alien invasion. But what if, notwithstanding the occasional humanist fable like “E.T.,” all those movies and television programs have been inculcating a potentially toxic form of interplanetary prejudice?“District 9,” a smart, swift new film from the South African director Neill Blomkamp (who now lives in Canada and who wrote the screenplay with Terri Tatchell), raises such a possibility in part by inverting an axiomatic question of the U.F.O. genre. In place of the usual mystery — what are they going to do to us? — this movie poses a different kind of hypothetical puzzle. What would we do to them? The answer, derived from intimate knowledge of how we have treated one another for centuries, is not pretty.A busy opening flurry of mock-news images and talking-head documentary chin scratching fills in a grim, disturbingly plausible scenario. Back in the 1980s a giant spacecraft stalled in the skies over Johannesburg. On board were a large number of starving and disoriented creatures, who were rescued and placed in a temporary refugee camp in the part of the city that gives the film its title. Over the next 20 years the settlement became a teeming shantytown like so many others in the developing world, with the relatively minor distinction of being home to tall, skinny bipeds with insectlike faces and bodies that seem to combine biological and mechanical features. Though there is evidence that those extraterrestrials — known in derogatory slang as prawns because of their vaguely crustacean appearance — represent an advanced civilization, their lives on Earth are marked by squalor and dysfunction. And they are viewed by South Africans of all races with suspicion, occasional pity and xenophobic hostility.The South African setting hones the allegory of “District 9” to a sharp topical point. That country’s history of apartheid and its continuing social problems are never mentioned, but they hardly need to be. And the film’s implications extend far beyond the boundaries of a particular nation, which is taken as more or less representative of the planet as a whole.No group, from the mostly white soldiers and bureaucrats who corral and abuse the prawns to the Nigerian gangsters who prey upon the aliens and exploit their addiction to cat food, is innocent. And casual bigotry turns out to be the least of the problems facing the exiles. As it progresses, “District 9” uncovers a horrific program of medical experimentation yoked to a near-genocidal agenda of corporate greed. A company called M.N.U. (it stands, none too subtly, for Multi-National United) has taken over administration of the prawn population, which means resettling the aliens in a remote enclosure reminiscent of the Bantustans of the apartheid era.The M.N.U. executive charged with carrying out this program is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a nervous nebbish whose father-in-law (Louis Minnaar) is the head of the company. Cowardly, preening and hopeless at projecting authority, Wikus is the kind of guy who gives nepotism a bad name. It says a lot about Mr. Blomkamp’s sense of humor, and about his view of his own species, that this pathetic little paper pusher is his chosen agent of mankind’s potential moral redemption.But I’m getting ahead of the story, and perhaps overselling the allegory. Not that the metaphorical resonances of “District 9” aren’t rich and thought provoking. But the filmmakers don’t draw them out with a heavy, didactic hand. Instead, in the best B-movie tradition, they embed their ideas in an ingenious, propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment, one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and, once in a while, your stomach turn).The early pseudo-documentary conceit, which uses footage that pretends to have been harvested from news choppers and security cameras as well as some by the unseen crew accompanying Wikus on his tour of the prawn camp, fades away after a while. The academic authorities do too, having served the dual functions of providing narrative exposition and demonstrating the high-minded uselessness of official liberal discourse.Once a terrible accident befalls Wikus, we are at his side and under his skin, and “District 9” subtly shifts from speculative science fiction to zombie bio-horror and then, less subtly, turns into an escape-action-chase movie full of explosions, gunplay and vehicular mayhem.In the midst of it all you almost take for granted the carefully rendered details of the setting, the tightness of the editing and the inventiveness of the special effects. Not the least of these are the aliens themselves, who are made expressive and soulful without quite being anthropomorphized. (Their whirring, clicking speech, partly understood by Wikus and others who work with the creatures, is translated for the rest of us via subtitles.)One in particular, named Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope), becomes Wikus’s protector and ward, and their relationship turns “District 9,” in its final act, into an intergalactic buddy picture, with some intriguing (and also possibly disappointing) sequel opportunities left open.At its core the film tells the story — hardly an unfamiliar one in the literature of modern South Africa — of how a member of the socially dominant group becomes aware of the injustice that keeps him in his place and the others, his designated inferiors, in theirs. The cost he pays for this knowledge is severe, as it must be, given the dreadful contours of the system. But if the film’s view of the world is bleak, it is not quite nihilistic. It suggests that sometimes the only way to become fully human is to be completely alienated.“District 9” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has intense violence and violent swearing in the languages of two planets.DISTRICT 9Opens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Neill Blomkamp; written by Mr. Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell; director of photography, Trent Opaloch; edited by Julian Clarke; production designer, Philip Ivey; music by Clinton Shorter; produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham; released by TriStar Pictures.

It’s no fun at all being right.Proving definitively that slapping Mr. Franco’s scenery-eating grin on any old drivel doesn’t guarantee entertainment, “Why Him?” is trite, crass and insultingly moronic. Shoveling expletives into the holes where jokes ought to be — a road too often traveled in today’s R-rated comedies — the director, John Hamburg, and Ian Helfer produce a screenplay that’s shockingly lazy and painfully attenuated.It’s also a coldly cynical reworking of Jay Roach’s “Meet the Parents” (which Mr. Hamburg helped write) as Laird, an oversexed tech billionaire, terrorizes Ned and Barb (Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally), the middle-class Midwestern parents of his girlfriend, Stephanie (Zoey Deutch). Invited to Laird’s Liberace-meets-Google estate in California, Ned and Barb are appalled to discover that their sweet, Stanford-educated daughter has fallen for a foulmouthed narcissist with as much disdain for clothing as paper.That’s important, as Ned is all about paper: He owns a failing paper company. The implication is that Ned and his kind — decent, thrifty and proper — are as irrelevant to the modern world as his product. And that Laird, whose inappropriateness and eager-puppy manner are at once offensive and ingratiating, belongs to a future that many of us are uncomfortable with.The standoff between the two men, then, is a rich vein that the filmmakers mine for no more than cheap, excruciatingly belabored gags. None more so than a homage to the “Pink Panther” movies, a sequence that the filmmakers smother so thoroughly in explanation that even the marvelous Keegan-Michael Key is unable to bring about resuscitation.Scenes like this expose a smugness in the filmmaking that disdains its audience. Devoid of a single authentic emotion (the central romance is a damp squib from the start), “Why Him?” is a movie made by and for men, little more than a vehicle for Mr. Franco’s peerless randy-pinhead routine. Lurking beneath, though, is a poignant study of oldster unease — with technology, with sexual explicitness, and perhaps most of all with money.

Mr. Meltzer’s purposefully vexing film is itself less a definitive account of the talkative Mr. Darby than a work focused on the problem of painting a fixed portrait of identity and motivations.Mr. Darby makes an especially painful case study in this regard. After working to aid those overwhelmed by Hurricane Katrina, he eventually horrified fellow activists by observing and reporting for the F.B.I. at the Republican National Convention in 2008. After helping to send two young men to prison on charges involving the making and possession of Molotov cocktails, he is presented here as if under siege in his own house. Shot in moodily lighted, head-on close-ups, he relates his side of the story, by turns blankly forthright and slightly peevish. In separate interviews, former associates don’t hold back their opinions of Mr. Darby’s actions.Mr. Meltzer uses re-enactments (which are also run in reverse) and interview outtakes to underline what is already amply clear: that the perspective changes, depending on who’s talking. At times, the crossfire feels gossipy. More important, Mr. Meltzer doesn’t quite find an effective tone or structure to stay on top of his unsettling person of interest, especially at one key point in Mr. Darby’s transformation from community activist to informant. But if his methods don’t come off smoothly, Mr. Meltzer’s conclusion does leave you feeling that even the whole story would be cold comfort for those involved.",0,9770.0,,0

Directed by Chris Wedge, the movie is a hymn to nature rendered in phantasmagoric detail as refined as anything I’ve seen in a computer-animated family film. But as beautiful as it is, “Epic” is fatally lacking in visceral momentum and dramatic edge. The broad concept — the existence of a teeming, nearly invisible kingdom that is as vital and energized as the world discernible to the naked eye — was inspired by William Joyce’s children’s book “The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs.” Besides “Avatar,” “Epic” borrows from “The Wizard of Oz” and “Alice in Wonderland,” but the references aren’t so blatant that they feel like theft. Although it depicts a war between good and evil, “Epic” has no real savagery. The bad guys may be ugly, but they are not sadistic monsters, and the battles produce no visible carnage. The forest, despite its dangers, is welcoming. “Epic” (from the creators of the “Ice Age” movies and “Rio”) is much better at visualizing the woods and its residents than at constructing a resonant pop allegory. The best it can come up with is the motto “Many leaves, one tree,” about all things being connected. You can read whatever else you like into a soothing fable for flower children that gently preaches that nature is good and its destruction bad. There is no suggestion of political axes being sharpened.Living on the edge of the forest in a shack cluttered with gadgets is the eccentric scientist Bomba (Jason Sudeikis), who has devoted his life to trying to prove the existence of this nearly invisible kingdom. The story begins when his spirited 17-year-old daughter, M. K. (Amanda Seyfried), strays into the forest to retrieve his three-legged pug, Ozzy, who has wandered off.There she meets Ronin (Colin Farrell, speaking in a mild Irish brogue), the leader of the Leafmen, a corps of green-uniformed eco-warriors committed to saving the forest from the evil Boggans. For reasons that are never specified, the not-so-fearsome leader of the Boggans, Mandrake (Christoph Waltz), is determined to destroy the forest and turn it into a putrid wasteland. The movie is too timid to ascribe his motives to development or oil exploration. He is a simply a champion of “creeping rot.” Flying rodents are the preferred mode of transportation for his swarming army. The Leafmen’s benign ruler, Queen Tara (Beyoncé Knowles), is a curvaceous, soft-voiced Glinda the Good whose 100-year reign will end when a flower pod bursts under a full moon to reveal the new queen. The Boggans are hellbent on capturing the pod and making sure that it opens in darkness, in which case they will have control of the territory. There is a “Wizard of Oz” figure in Nim Galuu (Steven Tyler), a blubbering, absent-minded yellow caterpillar whose scrolls record the forest’s history. Caught up in the struggle, M. K. shrinks to two inches in height when she enters the forest and befriends the Leafmen, who teach her to ride hummingbirds and execute acrobatic leaps worthy of Cirque du Soleil. Like Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” she longs to find her way home but is distracted by the attentions of Ronin’s cocky, rebellious protégé, Nod (Josh Hutcherson).Gentle comic relief is provided by Tara’s shape-shifting sidekicks, Mub (Aziz Ansari) and Grub (Chris O’Dowd), a slug and a snail with extended eyeballs who care for the pod. For what it’s worth, “Epic” is on the side of the angels.“Epic” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild action, some scary images and brief rude language.",0,107515297.0,107518682.0,0

Armed with a performance chart and the oblivious belief that her China-bound boyfriend will stand by and wait, Samantha (Miranda Kent) seeks out and judges men when she’s not plugging away at a stalled doctoral project involving sperm samples in a Harvard Medical School laboratory.Neither experimental endeavor has the comic payoff that the film’s writer and director, Valerie Weiss, believes it does. This movie, her debut feature, marches indefatigably through crude bits of business, wearily rehearsed caricatures (paranoid Jewish mother, straight-shooting best friend, incomprehensible Chinese colleague, kooky artist suitor) and oh-brother a-ha moments at designated pivot points in the story. When in doubt, Ms. Weiss resorts to a lab emergency or a frantic misunderstanding.As for romance, Sam and her boyfriend, an Eastern Studies scholar named Ben (Reid Scott, likably doing smart and sensitive), do make a cute earnest academic couple. And Sam’s panicked stasis, both social and professional, corresponds to a recognizable epidemic of the howling fantods in our nation’s graduate schools. But the tireless Ms. Kent, perpetually on screen, has to work at maintaining naïve, bright-eyed perk and a credible sense of moment-to-moment motivation.There are rare flashes of successful humor, as when the film deals with the behavior of jerks and a flustered cabby, but these are not likely to be replicated in the lab. If you want to enjoy watching a confused scientist grappling with life choices, stick with “The Nutty Professor.”",0,,,0
791,2017-10-13,The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),"Adam Sandler, Grace Van Patten, Dustin Hoffman, Elizabeth Marvel",USA,Noah Baumbach,"Comedy, Drama",English,79.0,112.0,Noah Baumbach,2017,7.0,26519.0,93.0,2017-11-11 17:44:02,GLENN KENNY,Review: Adam Sandler Is a Revelation in ‘The Meyerowitz Stories’,"The New York accent of Noah Baumbach’s new film, which he wrote and directed, is a particular and familiar one. The resonances begin with its title. “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” takes a literary angle that indirectly suggests The New Yorker, J. D. Salinger and, to some extent, Woody Allen. Mr. Baumbach sticks with the short-story conceit throughout, but he uses it as both a guiding principle and a means to surprise.After the quiet opening credits (delivered in a terribly genteel typeface), the first line of the first story appears: “Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.” The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off.This is good for a laugh (and there are more to come), but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan, a different side of the character appears. His daughter, Eliza (Grace Van Patten), has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father, which he shrugs off with good humor. When “Head to Toe,” a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car’s stereo, Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn’t, but as it happens, he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well), Danny seems, overall, a great dad and a warm-hearted guy.But Danny’s father, Harold, immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit — Eliza just for a night, as she’s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer, as he’s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman, Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can’t help commenting on repeatedly, talking over everyone around him: Danny, Eliza; his current wife and the world’s worst cook, Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later, his other son, Matthew (Ben Stiller), a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps.These characters have a lot to work out, and they do work it out, mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza’s first student film, a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named “Pagina-Man,” is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season.None of the Meyerowitzes are fulfilled, and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold’s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement, as when, on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen, in a droll cameo), he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says “I think this is my copy of ‘Buddenbrooks.’”With this film, Mr. Baumbach has achieved a near-perfect balance between engagement and discomfort. In “The Squid and the Whale” and “Margot at the Wedding,” something drove him to depict family squabbles with a candor that approached cruelty. The anger in those movies and some of his others was bracing, though a little more so than necessary. As boisterous and edgy as “The Meyerowitz Stories” gets, it is a more mellow film, and to my eyes and ears all the better for it.As is customary in Mr. Baumbach’s pictures, the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious, Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character, and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller’s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic, it is Mr. Sandler who excels, both riotously and poignantly.Mr. Baumbach’s fondness for his characters is such that as the movie passes its 90-minute mark, it becomes evident that he doesn’t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind.",1,,,0

Her fox sidekick, Nick Wilde, is mighty enjoyable, too.This film, action-packed and filled with enough savvy jokes that adults should consider slipping into the theater even if they don’t have an accompanying child, is set in a world where animals have transcended the carnivore-and-prey dichotomy and now live together more or less harmoniously.Judy (the voice of Ginnifer Goodwin of “Once Upon a Time”), a country bunny, wants to become the first rabbit police officer in the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, but her parents are not exactly the follow-your-dreams type.“If you don’t try anything new, you’ll never fail,” her father (Don Lake) tells her. It’s a gag that encapsulates one of the best things about this film: It trusts young viewers to recognize the clichés they’ve been fed by other animated movies over the years and to appreciate seeing them subverted.Judy graduates from the police academy and ends up on the force in Zootopia, but her boss (Idris Elba) relegates her to parking-ticket duty while more experienced officers investigate 14 missing-mammal cases. While obsessively writing tickets, Judy meets Nick (Jason Bateman), a world-weary hustler who slowly becomes her friend and adviser as she pokes her nose into the missing-mammal epidemic despite her boss’s resistance.If you’ve seen the trailer for this delightful movie you’ve already had a taste of what might be the greatest takedown of bureaucratic ineptitude ever filmed. It involves a trip by Judy and Nick to the Department of Motor Vehicles, with its all-sloth staff. In the context of children’s movies, it’s a fairly daring scene, since in an otherwise fast-moving story the joke takes a loooong time to roll out. But it sure is worth it.Anyway, Judy learns some hard truths as she delves deeper into the mystery, and young viewers will, too. Chief among those is one adults know well: Being civilized doesn’t mean tension and ugly thoughts disappear. Also, bringing about positive change isn’t as easy as it seems.“I came here to make the world a better place,” Judy laments after her good intentions backfire, “but I think I broke it.”Funny, smart, thought-provoking — and musical, too. Shakira provides the voice of a pop star named Gazelle, and her vocals complete the package appealingly.“Zootopia” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for gently rude humor and occasional scariness.

In the middle of a mawkish confession, a crude zinger from out of the blue is liable to shatter the mood, presumably for the sake of levity in a movie that isn’t funny, merely bizarre.In the opening scene, Ted (Seann William Scott), a mild-mannered 41-year-old pet store manager who appears to be in perfectly good health, cheerfully announces that he plans to commit suicide. Why? His long-dead father brought him up to believe that the world was a safe and decent place, and he found out it wasn’t. “Don’t feel bad for me,” he chirps.

O. SCOTT,There Will Be Megalomania,"“The Master,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s imposing, confounding and altogether amazing new film, is partly concerned with the life and work of one Lancaster Dodd, leader of a therapeutic, quasi-religious cult known as the Cause. Dodd’s “process,” a stew of Freud, hypnosis and carnival sideshow mumbo-jumbo, is based on a kind of mental time travel. The subject is led, by a series of pointed, painful questions, on a search for past trauma — earlier in life, before birth, in a previous existence — that can be identified as the source of negative emotion and destructive behavior in the present.At a certain point Dodd modifies his theory, suggesting that instead of “remembering” our prenatal past, our minds “imagine” it. This shift leads to some consternation among his followers (notably a wealthy benefactor played by Laura Dern), and it may also fuel the audience’s skepticism about this charismatic mountebank, brought to life by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the flair and precision of a great concert pianist.More showman than shaman — he holds his followers in thrall with jokes, dinner-table toasts and bawdy songs — Dodd is so adept at the performance of sincerity that he may long ago have fooled himself into believing the bizarre doctrines he seems to pull out of thin air. “The Master,” meanwhile, is rigorously agnostic about his methods and intentions, refusing the temptations of satire and gazing fondly at Dodd’s follies even as it notes the brutal way he and his acolytes deal with doubters and heretics. This semi-sympathetic stance makes sense, since the film, a glorious and haunting symphony of color, emotion and sound, is very much its own Cause.Our minds sometimes play tricks on us, substituting invention for memory. Movies turn this lapse into a principle, manufacturing collective fantasies that are often more vivid, more real, than what actually happened. “The Master,” unfolding in the anxious, movie-saturated years just after World War II, is not a work of history in the literal or even the conventionally literary sense. The strange and complicated story it has to tell exists beyond the reach of doubt or verification. The cumulative artifice on display is beautiful — camera movements that elicit an involuntary gasp, passages in Jonny Greenwood’s score that raise the hair on the back of your neck, feats of acting that defy comprehension — but all of it has been marshaled in the pursuit of a new kind of cinematic truth. This is a movie that defies understanding even as it compels reverent, astonished belief.Lancaster Dodd bears a clear resemblance to L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, and there are strong echoes of Hubbard’s Dianetics in the theory and practice of the Cause, but viewers of “The Master” hoping for insight into the prehistory of Tom Cruise’s love life will be disappointed. Hubbard’s rise is the kernel of this film much in the way that the career of the early-20th-century California oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny was the seed from which Mr. Anderson (assisted by Upton Sinclair’s muckraking novel “Oil!”) coaxed the lurid blossom that was “There Will Be Blood.” The stiff, theatrical pseudo-realism of period drama is the last thing on this director’s mind.In “The Master” the production designers Jack Fisk and David Crank have produced a sensuous, richly detailed and absolutely plausible vision of 1950, and the cinematographer, Mihai Malaimare Jr., takes advantage of the density and sheen of the 70-millimeter format to approximate the lush visual grandeur of mid-50s melodrama. The specters of Eisenhower-era auteurs like George Stevens, Max Ophuls, Nicholas Ray and Douglas Sirk hover just outside the frame, along with the ghosts of the spiritual seekers, sexual adventurers and shellshocked veterans who dotted the American landscape at the dawn of the atomic age.Which brings us to Freddie Quell, an alcoholic wreck played with sly, manic ferocity by Joaquin Phoenix. “The Master” is really more Freddie’s story than Dodd’s, and some of the film’s drama resides in the struggle between the two characters — and perhaps the two actors — for supremacy. “You’ll be my protégé and my guinea pig,” Dodd says to Freddie shortly after their first meeting. There turns out to be a lot more to it than that. They are father and son, guru and disciple, passionate friends and bitter competitors locked in a relationship whose sexual undercurrents are as palpable and mysterious as the motion of water under the surface of the ocean.After serving with the Navy in the Pacific war, Freddie, a native of Lynn, Mass., washes up in California like a bit of human flotsam. Psychiatric interviews before his discharge confirm what a few wartime scenes have already suggested, namely that this guy is a mess. Shown a series of Rorschach inkblots, he sees only genitalia. Asked to account for his strange behavior, he mumbles and equivocates. Though Freddie finds work at a department store and, later, in the cabbage fields of Salinas, his real vocation is inventing and consuming cocktails made of paint thinner, darkroom chemicals, household cleaning supplies and whatever else is at hand.Dodd offers treatment (and samples Freddie’s concoctions), but the film does not supply a diagnosis. Freddie’s menacing oddness may result from those potions, from the war or from some other buried trouble that has left him, as Dodd puts it, “aberrated.” There is certainly pain in Freddie’s past, including a lost love (Madisen Beaty) summoned to the screen during a therapeutic session with Dodd. But no single cause could account for the tangle of tics and urges that make up Freddie’s personality. Mr. Phoenix, his shoulders hunched, his speech barely intelligible, his face twisted, pushes his performance beyond the psychological gestures of the Method (which was very much in vogue in the early days of Dianetics) into a zone of pure, feral, improvisatory being.Mr. Hoffman, in contrast, presents an integrated, highly nuanced, supremely Methodical self to the camera. The two actors work in a counterpoint that expresses not only the diverging temperaments of the men they are playing but also some of the contradictions of their era. Dodd (whose name is rarely uttered aloud in the film) is, to himself and his followers, the very incarnation of success, with the discipline of a scientist and the drive of an entrepreneur.Freddie’s creased and haggard face is a road map of failure. But the Master is also a charlatan and a tyrant, driven by vanity and paranoia as much as by any rational ambition. And Freddie, however damaged he may be, is at the same time a person of unquestionable sincerity. Neither he nor Dodd is a stable, singular entity. Each is, in turn, hero and villain, master and disciple, con man and patsy.The third voice — the one that binds the film together — belongs to Peggy Dodd (Amy Adams), the latest of the Master’s several wives and the hidden hand that directs his empire. Peggy, who is either pregnant or holding a child in almost all of her scenes, embodies a familiar feminine ideal, and Ms. Adams does nothing to subvert the image of a perfect mother and helpmeet. What she does is show, plainly and gracefully, how the pursuit of such perfection can be monstrous.At times “The Master” seems entirely populated by monsters, though occasionally someone — in particular Dodd’s cynical son Val (Jesse Plemons) — will sound a note of common sense. But common sense does not much interest Mr. Anderson, who glimpses the reflection of his own ambition in the aspirations of his characters, and who rewrites the rules of filmmaking at will.He has never made a western — “Punch-Drunk Love,” a tale of righteous revenge starring Adam Sandler, probably comes closest — but all of Mr. Anderson’s six feature films to date are at least partially meditations on the American West. “Hard Eight” takes place in Reno; “Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia” and “Punch-Drunk Love” in the San Fernando Valley; and “There Will be Blood” in the oil fields of Southern California. “The Master” travels east — to New York, Philadelphia and England — but its geographic touchstones are the Pacific Ocean and the Arizona desert.In all of those places, and at every point in history, Mr. Anderson discovers the perpetual promise of new beginnings and a poisonous backwash of anomie, violence and greed. In his world fortunes are constantly being made and squandered. New religions are springing to life. Gamblers, pornographers, hustlers and drunks are plumbing the mysteries of existence. Fathers are at war with their biological and symbolic sons. Husbands are at war with wives. Men are at war with the universe, perversely convinced that they have a chance of winning.All of this striving — absurd, tragic, grotesque and beautiful — can feel like too much. “The Master” is wild and enormous, its scale almost commensurate with Lancaster Dodd’s hubris and its soul nearly as restless as Freddie Quell’s. It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything I’ve seen recently to being a great movie. There will be skeptics, but the cult is already forming. Count me in.“The Master” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Nudity, sex, smoking and drinking, much of it in a dubious cause.",1,15800000.0,16022451.0,0

A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.Part of the pleasure of Mr. Haynes’s films — which include “I’m Not There” and “Carol” — is how he deploys intellectual distance as he plays with cinematic form, considers identity and upends clichés. Elsewhere, this can come across as dreary, even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas, his films gather force until, at times with near-violent suddenness, they become devastatingly, skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes’s “Far From Heaven,” his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And, in “Wonderstruck,” a children’s story about finding your place in the world, in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity, desire and imagination.“Wonderstruck” takes a while to find its groove, but it gets there. Mr. Haynes’s oscillation between the story’s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gonçalves), but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That’s particularly true because it’s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben’s half has its attractions, including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it’s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick’s storytelling, with its mysticism and coincidences, creaks the loudest.Mr. Selznick’s emphasis on wonder — represented by the story’s surfeit of enchantments and the near-miraculously fitted parts — can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick’s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes “Wonderstruck” his own because the wonder of the film isn’t in its story but in its telling. It’s in the expressive beauty of his images, the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally, generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life, allowing them to find themselves — in their willfulness, their heartbreaks and their imaginings — so that eventually they can find someone else.",1,976561.0,1033632.0,0

O. SCOTT,"Now They’ll Love Me, a Twin Sister Schemes","In “The Pretty One,” Jenée LaMarque’s first feature, Zoe Kazan plays identical twins of contrasting temperament. Audrey, alluded to in the title, has a cute haircut, fashionable clothes and an exciting life in a city that might be Los Angeles. (The film is too coy to be specific about such things.) Her sister, Laurel, mousy and odd, lives with their widowed father (John Carroll Lynch) in a rambling house in a quirky town where she helps him paint copies of famous artworks. Then, as a result of a not-very-convincing car crash, Audrey dies and Laurel, mistaken for her sister, assumes her identity. She goes to the city, meets Audrey’s married lover (Ron Livingston) and her bookish neighbor (Jake M. Johnson) and takes up Audrey’s job selling real estate. The imposture is clumsy and tentative, which Laurel blames on amnesia from the accident. “The Pretty One” is intermittently charming, occasionally touching and entirely lacking in credibility. The script, in which self-consciously playful banter gives way to sudden floods of loud feeling, might have worked better as a string of emoji. Neither the comedy nor the melodrama works on its own terms, and Ms. LaMarque’s attempt to blend them is more awkward than bittersweet. The camera setups are as passive-aggressively deadpan as the dialogue, alternating between static wide shots and too-tight close-ups.The performances are not bad, though. Ms. Kazan, frantic and vulnerable, tries to keep Laurel/Audrey away from the clichés that lie in wait for her (them?) like ogres in a fairy tale. As an actress, she is always looking for new, appealing ways to be odd, and she’s good at finding them. Mr. Johnson, moonlighting from his grumpy goofball role on “New Girl,” seems to be refining a new millennial romantic archetype: the stoic, shaggy dream guy.But there is something more than a little ghoulish about building a sweet, hipsterish romantic comedy on the grave of a dead sibling, and “The Pretty One” wavers queasily between macabre humor and wide-eyed sincerity. You are urged to laugh and cry, but the best you are likely to manage is a polite, embarrassed smile.“The Pretty One” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Not that Stanley Pleskun, a k a Stanless Steel, is in any way clapped out: he can hoist 10,000-pound trucks with his legs and  three adults with a single finger. It’s the emotional heavy lifting that does him in.By day, Mr. Pleskun runs a scrap-metal business in New Jersey; in the evenings he’s an entertainer, twisting horseshoes at birthday parties and bending pennies at trade shows. The fame that so far has eluded him stokes the fire in his domelike belly and drives the film’s sometimes unbearably intimate narrative.“You can’t bend people,” this gentle giant acknowledges in a rare flash of insight, but that doesn’t keep him from trying. And in Mr. Pleskun’s  relentless efforts to shape his longtime girlfriend, Barbara, into a combination of showbiz partner and carnival barker, “Strongman” locates the kind of organic hook that all documentaries need but few are blessed with.Mr. Levy doesn’t waste it. Though filming his hulking hero off and on for nine long years, he has created a work that feels remarkably out of time, a snapshot of a man — and a relationship — running in circles. Childlike one minute and cunning the next, Mr. Pleskun demands that Barbara, as well as his scrappy family (whose support is diluted by illness, alcohol and hard drugs), share his musclebound dreams. In the film’s most wrenching scene, Barbara is wedged between Mr. Pleskun and his brother while they sing along to a truck radio. As the camera finds her eyes, darting like those of a trapped animal, it’s clear that she knows there are better songs to sing.STRONGMANOpens on Wednesday  in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Zachary Levy; director of photography, Mr. Levy; edited by Mr. Levy, Jonathan Oppenheim and Jane Brill; music by Penny Lang; released by No Props Inc.

Jackie Chan has been replaced by the  Korean star Jang Dong Gun, and Lucy Liu by a remarkably composed toddler named Analin Rudd.On a conceptual level “The Warrior’s Way” is something altogether different and more self-conscious. Set in a fantastical ghost town with a resident circus troupe and filmed on studio sets, it looks like a Sergio Leone epic as staged by Fellini, or by Lars von Trier. The genre-mashing makes sense, given the résumé of the writer and director, Sngmoo Lee, who has a master’s degree in cinema studies from New York University and helped found the film department at the Korean National University of Arts.The best way to understand the film, though, is in commercial terms: as an attempt to use Mr. Jang to cash in on the audience that has come out for crossover action hits starring Mr. Chan and Jet Li. Mr. Jang has presence and a movie-star face, but he’s a latecomer to martial arts and swordplay; following a typical South   Korean path, he started out in soap operas and moved into crime and war movies, building a distinguished (and highly profitable) filmography that includes the great action-crime drama “Nowhere to Hide.”Generalizing brutally, you could argue that Hong Kong movies require actors trained to be fluid and funny, while South   Korean movies like their male characters stiff and stern, and Mr. Jang doesn’t make the same kind of impression in “The Warrior’s Way” that his Hong Kong counterparts have in their American movies. The film also muffles him by keeping his dialogue to a minimum (even though his English is perfectly acceptable), filling the space with Geoffrey Rush’s narration and the chattering of Kate Bosworth’s logorrheic female sidekick.Mr. Jang is not the problem with “The Warrior’s Way,” however. That would be Mr. Lee’s screenplay, a thin and unconvincing gruel of western clichés, martial arts action and forced comedy that wouldn’t make the grade in the graphic novels that have clearly helped form his vision.Ms. Bosworth, the phlegmatic Mr. Jang and a ragged, occasionally amusing Mr. Rush  — the good, the sad and the ugly  — face off against a cartoonish brigand (Danny Huston, admirably restrained) and phalanxes of hooded swordsmen led by the usual mystical Chinese warrior (Ti Lung, ditto). The sometimes impressive visual effects make these battles entertaining, in a mindless way, but it’s impossible to work up any feeling about them. The only thing supplying that is the occasional laugh, pout or gurgle by Ms. Rudd.“The Warrior’s Way” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for increasingly intense comic-book violence.THE WARRIOR’S WAYOpened on Friday  nationwide.Written and directed by Sngmoo Lee; director of photography, Woo Hyung Kim; fight choreography by Yuji Shimomura; edited by Jonno Woodford-Robinson; music by Javier Navarrete; production design by Dan Hennah; costumes by James Acheson; produced by Barrie M.

Not Here, Knucklehead","Every straight man has a stooge — Abbott had Costello, Crosby had Hope — the foil, the fool, the flunky, the goat. But for much of their career, after splitting from a famous straight man, the Three Stooges had only one another to kick and slap around. Beginning in the 1930s these immortal three ran amok for decades in some 200 short films, busting guts and raking in cash. Now, with stupidity a proud national pastime on the boob tube and off, the moment is ripe for a nyuk-nyuk revival, starting with “The Three Stooges: The Movie,” Peter and Bobby Farrelly’s thoroughly enjoyable paean to Moe, Larry and Curly and the art of the eye poke.Set in the present, the movie is a fictionalized origin story about three sort-of-lovable fools who could be known as Dumb, Dumber and Dumbest, as Peter Farrelly originally pitched the movie. It’s a perfect fit for the Farrellys, who have made a career out of idiocy in comedies like “Kingpin” and have recently stumbled with duds like “The Heartbreak Kid.” Written by the Farrellys and Mike Cerrone, “The Three Stooges” imagines a once-upon-an-orphanage time when three babies are tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun whose name, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David in a habit and snarl), announces that the filmmakers won’t be soft-pedaling their shtick.The nun’s name proves something of a bait and switch because Sister Mary-Mengele turns out to be the most gleefully offensive jape in a movie that’s more sweet than sour. That’s par for the course for the Farrellys, whose vulgarity has always been leavened by their sense of decency and too frequently undermined by their sentimentalism. Even so, while “The Three Stooges” has a few aww moments, as might be expected given that it’s partly set in an orphanage, and although the Farrellys go soft on the Stooges’ relationships, the filmmakers never lose sight of the crude comedy that inspired them. The Stooges’ bonds of brotherhood may be strong, but they’re ties forged by a choreographed roundelay of resonant whacks and other instances of extreme discipline and punishment.The unabashedly creaky story, divided into “episodes,” follows the Stooges from infancy through childhood to nominal adulthood. By the time they’re grown, physically if not in any other way, Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (Sean Hayes) and Curly (Will Sasso) are forced to try and save the orphanage from the bad economy and other calamities. Sent out into the world by the Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) with some cash and no worldly experience, the Stooges land first in an anonymous city and then in a noir intrigue with a femme fatale, Lydia (Sofia Vergara), and her lover, Mac (Craig Bierko). Trouble ensues along with a lion, a bear (oh my), the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa) and, in a sharp, funny stroke, some of the cast from “Jersey Shore.”The Farrellys don’t overtly mock the “Shore” personalities; there’s no need for them to work that hard. Like some other reality TV stars (the Bravo housewives come to mind), characters like Snooki have assumed the function of a new kind of stooge. In vaudeville the stooge’s traditional role was to give the comic something to work off of, a straight line or a bit of business. The stooge tripped, acted silly, feigned being foolish. The new stooge does pretty much the same thing, the difference being that reality-television celebrities have turned their lives (or some weird approximation of life) into vaudeville. Of course there’s stupid and there’s stupid, and the real Stooges, like the actors playing them in this movie, were performing dumbness, which pretty much seems the point here.And the three leads in “The Three Stooges” play dumb very well, particularly Mr. Sasso. He beautifully captures Curly’s facial contortions and vocalizations — woo-woo-woo — and, as important, the delicate physicality, the fluttering fingers and flapping feet. Topped with Moe’s bowl cut, Mr. Diamantopoulos bunches his face into a fist and hits his lines like a speed bag (“whatsthemattawithyou?”), while Mr. Hayes, crowned with Larry’s tragically balding Afro and at times sounding like Bert Lahr’s Cowardly Lion, seems to have more to do than the original Stooge ever did. As usual the Farrellys give this movie about as much visual style as you’d find in a Stooges two-reeler, but, as with the original films, you may be too busy watching and laughing at Moe, Larry and Curly to care.At their best the Farrellys’ movies exult in the stupid and the profane as a means of liberation, including from good taste, even if their characters tend to put away their freak flags at the end, often in the interest of a normalizing romance. Much of the pleasure in “The Three Stooges” comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye, enduring psychological damage or, as bad, being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch, the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming. They are, as the Farrellys understand, testaments to human resilience, one slap and tickle at a time.“The Three Stooges” is rated PG.

One half of an insistently winning, hopelessly irresistible mother-daughter duet, this buttinsky New Jersey widow (Susan Sarandon) puts the “awl” into call and the “awk” into talk and works both your nerves and ears as she does. Having recently moved to Los Angeles, Marnie has turned her cellphone into an umbilical cord that keeps her hooked to her daughter, Lori (Rose Byrne). “The Meddler” is a tear-drizzled comedy, but I understand if it sounds like a horror movie.It’s a little of both, in truth, with some family melodrama and sweet romance thrown in. Affable, earnest and humanly scaled, “The Meddler” is the kind of entertainment that the studios used to supply by the boatload and that now tends to show up on the small screen. Its emphasis on a mother and daughter relationship, in particular, brings to mind maternal melodramas like the glorious weepie “Stella Dallas” (1937), about a woman who asks her wealthy estranged husband to finish raising their daughter so that the girl can live like the people in movies.The difference being that “The Meddler” is agreeably (unusually) optimistic about human relationships, despite the melancholy edging its comedy. Marnie is the biggest source of the humor, and Ms. Sarandon plays her beautifully in every shade of sunshine. One of those relentlessly “on” people who’s always on the go, Marnie is always talking (including on her cell behind the wheel) and always doing, and always talking while doing. There’s compulsiveness to her meddlesomeness. Marnie doesn’t just call Lori, she does so repeatedly, babbling away as if each call were another clause in a sentence without end (“anyway”).The writer-director Lorene Scafaria leads with her laughs. Marnie enters yakking and keeps the motor running, including in voice-over. The patter is inane, funny, lifelike, and Ms. Sarandon’s Jersey intonations give it a comic topspin. Ms. Scafaria seeds these passages with information — Marnie’s dead husband, Joe, was the love of her life — and you can see the narrative machinery in action. But part of what makes the movie work is its unshowy realism, including yammer that isn’t the stuff of dramatic setup or tension but instead resembles the churn of random observations and pointless asides. The sort that swirls through your head and you sometimes share with someone when you’re unpacking groceries, making dinner or just calling to chat — only funnier.The story begins to catch up to Marnie’s accelerated rhythms when Lori splits for New York to work on a pilot she’s written, leaving her mom alone. Marnie copes with this separation in her usual fashion, calling Lori amid visits to the mall (cue the Crate & Barrel product placements) and visits to Lori’s dogs, Lori’s friends and Lori’s shrink. Marnie has started to see the therapist (Amy Landecker in a quick, deadpan turn) at Lori’s urging, though mostly she seems to go as a way to insinuate herself even more deeply into her daughter’s life. It’s no wonder that Marnie seems like a smother-mother who’s one 911 call away from a restraining order; no wonder too that she seems lonely.It would be easy to put Marnie on the couch, to assume that she’s neurotic rather than, you know, friendly, and that she talks a lot only to fill the silences or because the quiet might bring on the grief and self-reflection. But she’s plenty self-knowing already, thanks, and Ms. Sarandon shows you the self-awareness hovering behind Marnie’s smile and trembling in her pauses. Still, there is work to be done, a life to live, and, in a sense, the movie is a coming-of-later-age story in which a mother learns how to cut the cord one funny, poignant snip at a time and discovers herself in the process. In this, Marnie receives help from a much younger mother, Jillian (Cecily Strong), and a new friend, Zipper (J.K. Simmons), who each peel back layers.The same goes for the movie, which has a humble, utilitarian visual style, except that everyone looks really pretty, Ms. Sarandon, Ms. Byrne and Mr. Simmons included. Part of this is the quality of the Los Angeles light, which here has none of its sunshine-and-noir harshness but instead gives the characters an appealing glow, a glow that after a while feels like adoration. When Marnie looks at Lori — and Lori looks at Marnie — you are watching two people who, despite the nonsense, care for each other deeply. You see their happiness and you share in it too because in “The Meddler” Ms. Scafaria is holding up that softening filter through which each of us sees the funny, maddening, indispensable people with whom we laugh, mourn and, if we’re lucky, find love.“The Meddler” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

In “Stone,” a brooding, low-key intrigue, Mr. Norton wears cornrows and tattoos, and much as he did in his screen debut, “Primal Fear,” keeps his performance in check. He plays the title character in the new movie, an arsonist turned inmate who’s grown weary of waiting to be released. As far as Stone can tell, or as far as the movie initially suggests, the only thing standing between him and the outside world is an unsmiling parole officer, Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro), who, when he’s not shuffling papers, listens — in his car and at home  — to Christian talk radio.If the image of Mr. De Niro driving around like God’s lonely man sounds familiar, it should. Whether or not the filmmakers wanted to invoke “Taxi Driver,” that image is of a piece with the  narrative strategies in “Stone.” It opens with a flashback sequence that plays like a prelude to a horror flick, complete with a  signifying insect that might make you flash on Hitchcock’s “Psycho.” The story then flips to a present that looks a lot like the near past, where Jack and his wife, Madylyn (Frances Conroy), make a nice gothic picture. They spend their evenings swilling booze and listening to more religious chatter, a habit that Stone sets out to break by dangling his own wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), in front of Jack’s dead eyes.“Stone” sets up its coordinates smoothly, first with that flashback and then with character types and story beats that are tinted noir, ornamented with spooky sound work (percussive thumping, droning near-silence) and wrapped in razor wire. The writer Angus MacLachlan (“Junebug”) and the director John Curran (“The Painted Veil,” in which Mr. Norton starred)  bank on your familiarity with genre conventions, and they count on your expectations of what happens when those conventions are deployed in a movie that looks and talks as tough as this one. By the time Lucetta is making like Gloria Grahame, dragging on a cigarette outside the prison, it’s easy to believe that she’s a moll who’s about to spring her man and beat it to Mexico in a 1953 sedan with shot springs.Does she or doesn’t she, will he or won’t he? None of the performers tip a hand as to where they are eventually headed. A restrained Mr. Norton and a tamped-down Mr. De Niro make fine opponents, though their best scenes play out separately. A mercurial Ms. Jovovich helps turn up the heat, partly by stripping off her clothes, while Ms. Conroy, who played the matriarch on HBO’s  “Six Feet Under,” adds a spooky touch. After the characters have been locked in place, the filmmakers  let some blood run and spurt. It’s a gruesome display that adds to the unease, but it’s also a distraction because, not long after, the  narrative  takes a hard, sharp turn away from the pulp-fiction terrain they have effectively mapped out.The results prove disappointing, simultaneously over the top and underwhelming. That’s too bad because until that detour “Stone” keeps you watching, engaged and guessing. You can understand why the filmmakers  didn’t want to make just another genre movie in which everything falls neatly into place. They want to mess with our heads, but intelligently. The paradox is that what they try to subvert in “Stone” — namely, your viewing habits — are intrinsic to your enjoyment of the movie. They summon up past pulp delights with a couple of baddies and a dame with snake hips and eyes, only to toss them out in exchange for an ending that is unpredictable yet also flat. They end up subverting expectations by denying pleasure.“Stone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Led by Alex (Alejandro Gallardo), a virginal Iggy Pop admirer, the boys pass the summer rehearsing with their dreadful garage band, whose name, Mari Pepa, celebrates two of their highest aspirations: marijuana and vaginas. Maybe that’s why they’ve managed to write only one song.Filmed in loose, unstructured scenes, the boys’ daily doings have a knockabout naturalism that feels honest and real. Devoid of harsh cuts or forced drama, the meandering narrative interrupts their efforts to write a second song with poignant, observant incidents — like a random encounter with a washed-up, boozed-up soccer player — that bring them abruptly into contact with the adult world.The movie is at its best, however, when talk recedes and everything goes quiet. In the small, wordless interactions of Alex and his ailing grandmother (a wonderfully expressive Petra Iñiguez Robles), we hear the smack of innocence colliding with experience. And as she gently washes his hands and cooks his breakfast, we fear that his carefree summer will be ending all too soon.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,"Monsters, Machines and Mind Melding in a Race for the World","Viewed from one angle — from below, say, as you cower before the Imax screen, your 3-D glasses digging into the bridge of your nose, condensation from your Diet Coke dripping onto your leg — “Pacific Rim” looks a lot like other movies of its type. Dinosaurish creatures as big as skyscrapers do battle with equally gigantic robots on land and sea, pulverizing familiar cities and churning up geysers of spume. Human characters (some of whom are actually inside the giant robots) bark out catchphrases, spout fake science and express noble sentiments as they fight to save the planet. More than two hours of your life elapse before they do.So consider yourself warned. If you walk in expecting subtlety, or even novelty, you may find yourself more tormented than entertained. But “Pacific Rim” is also a reminder — either just in time or much too late — that this kind of movie can and should be fun. Some of those catchphrases are mildly clever. The lab coat mumbo-jumbo is amusing. The noble sentiments touch sweet chords. And who does not delight in seeing a robot punch a dinosaur every now and then — or pretty much constantly for two hours?The director, Guillermo del Toro (who wrote the script with Travis Beacham), is an unabashed genre enthusiast and a feverish inventor of fantastical worlds, enchanted by the visual and symbolic power of monsters and intoxicated by his own imagination. It is true that he has employed that imagination to more memorable effect in other movies, notably the wonderful “Hellboy” pictures and the shattering Spanish Civil War horror-allegories “Pan’s Labyrinth” and “The Devil’s Backbone.” Admirers of those films may find this one crude and overscale by comparison. Still, “Pacific Rim,” with its carefree blend of silliness and solemnity, is clearly the product of an ingenious and playful pop sensibility.“But Gipsy is analog!” This exclamation, though not immediately intelligible out of context (or in it, for that matter), is in some ways the key to the movie. A bit of explanation is in order, though I’m afraid it will not be as exhaustive or as breathless as the voice-over narration that begins the movie or the expository dialogue that pops up throughout. Gipsy is a Jaeger, one of the enormous metal bipeds built to fight off the Kaiju, horrible creatures who have popped up through the bottom of the Pacific Ocean via a portal to their native dimension. Still with me? The Kaiju are, as alien invaders tend to be, quite hostile. They are also diabolically clever, evolving quickly in response to military attempts to defeat them. After a long war of attrition (dramatized in a precredit chunk that is almost a movie in itself), only a handful of Jaegers remain, concentrated in Hong Kong for a last stand against the enemy. Commanded by the wondrously named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the Jaeger pilots — who must work in pairs assisted by technology that links their brains — are a motley global crew. Our attention is particularly focused on Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who seem to have especially traumatic experiences with Kaiju in their pasts.There is also an Australian father-son team (Max Martini and Rob Kazinsky) — Raleigh and the son, who are hard to tell apart, trade a few punches at one point — and a duo of manic, mismatched scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) for comic relief. Hellboy himself (that is, Ron Perlman) shows up as a local underworld figure, doing more for the film’s attitude than for its plot. Wearing dark glasses and metal-toed shoes and spouting Runyonesque gangster gibberish, he reminds you that “Pacific Rim” is, more than anything else, a cartoon.Which brings me back to the analog identity of Gipsy, which is able to keep fighting when some bad Kaiju mojo shuts down the fancy digital Jaeger. “Pacific Rim” is loaded with computer-generated imagery, but its soul is proudly mechanical. Its off-kilter sense of proportion harks back to the inspired models and stop-motion techniques of the late special-effects maestro Ray Harryhausen. Even in 3-D (which does not add much of interest), the images are composed of bright tones and blocky shapes, like old comic-book panels. And this future, for all the talk of “neural drift” and dimensional wormholes, is a world of tubes and rivets and pistons. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells would appreciate it.The pleasures of “Pacific Rim,” in other words, are somewhat nostalgic, and maybe also regressive. This in itself is hardly unusual: most of the movies released by major studios from May to September cater to the childish impulses of the audience. But they also often aspire to be more than juvenile, puffing themselves up with money and fuzzy, heavy themes. Sometimes they succeed and find a measure of real grandeur. This summer, though, has so far largely been a parade of joyless bombast. In these circumstances Mr. del Toro’s exuberant nonsense comes as a relief. “Pacific Rim” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

But as the director, Sandy McLeod, goes on to track the efforts of a crusader for crop diversity, this often dry film gets stuck on certain points and leaves seed preservation feeling oddly abstract.Cary Fowler, soft-spoken and polite, discusses his work with international organizations to counteract the plummet in crop diversity since the rise of modern agriculture. We also visit the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, a pioneering seed institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a seed-collectors’ exchange in Iowa. A recurring strand of the film follows rural Peruvians who are receiving international aid with growing potatoes, which yields some eye candy through their colorful traditional clothing and the mountain backdrops.The urgency of expanding the world’s seed portfolio is made eminently clear, but the film falters at explaining how these preventive efforts would translate into an impact on a grand scale. The visually inert conference meetings and the sometimes stagy Peru segments mainly tend to reiterate the importance of the subject. Ms. McLeod initially features so much voice-over by Mr. Fowler that the first part of the film feels like a lecture on tape.Perhaps it’s a hazard tied to a subject, seeds, which are all about potential, but Ms. McLeod’s film feels naggingly diffuse and insufficiently vivid in evoking diversity.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,Some People Persist in Taking an Endless Timeout From Adult Life ,"Ten years after senior prom, Megan (Keira Knightley) finds herself in limbo, no longer adolescent and not yet fully grown. It’s a familiar place for the protagonist of a movie comedy to be, and perhaps a further symptom of the shaky state of American adulthood. In Megan’s circle of high school friends, the one who is about to get married (Ellie Kemper) and the one who already has a husband and a kid on the way (Sara Coates) seem kind of awful. Who would want to be so judgmental and shallow, or so blissed-out and dim? Not Megan. But then again, it isn’t as if her own life were anything fabulous.Megan has been trained as a therapist, but she’d rather work for her father (Jeff Garlin), an accountant, dancing around with a sign to attract customers. Though she feels free to drop by her parents’ house to watch TV and score a free meal whenever she likes, she lives with her high school boyfriend, a wet noodle named Anthony (Mark Webber), who has finally worked up enough courage to suggest marriage. His fumbling proposal, along with some other stuff, precipitates the central crisis of “Laggies,” Lynn Shelton’s curious, intermittently winning hybrid of coming-of-age story and romantic comedy.Like Ms. Shelton’s earlier films (“Your Sister’s Sister” and “Humpday”), this one takes place in and around Seattle, a place apparently full of unpretentious white people, neither intimidatingly cool nor tediously generic. Ms. Knightley, a proven chameleon, fits right in, suppressing her British accent, showing off her skateboard moves and even dabbling in a bit of vocal fry. She makes Megan perfectly likable, which isn’t entirely a good thing.“Laggies” itself is so eager to be liked that it undermines some of its comic ingenuity. Like the confused guy played by Mark Duplass in “Your Sister’s Sister,” Megan stumbles into a situation that is inappropriate in ways she doesn’t quite understand. Fleeing her best friend’s wedding, she winds up hanging out with a group of teenagers who seem like a more comfortable fit than the old crowd. Later, fleeing from Anthony, she crashes on the bedroom floor of one of them, a savvy and self-possessed girl named Annika, played by Chloë Grace Moretz with her usual poise and discipline.Annika lives with her sarcastic, heartbroken dad, Craig (Sam Rockwell), her mother (Gretchen Mol) having run off some time ago to become a lingerie model. Megan assumes a curious role in the household. She’s Annika’s confidante but also a surrogate big sister and almost-mom, toggling between silliness and wisdom and meanwhile bantering and sidestepping toward a romance with Craig.There is enormous potential here for misunderstandings, bad feelings and serious trouble — the kind of friction that could generate either rattling melodrama or giddy farce. But Ms. Shelton sticks to a safe and dubious middle ground, making sure to resolve conflicts before they become too messy and encouraging everyone to learn the necessary lessons as quickly and painlessly as possible. You might think that a vulnerable 16-year-old girl might be a little upset, or mildly creeped out, if her father and her new best friend started sleeping together. “Laggies” allows you to think that for about half a minute, before shrugging, smiling and moving on.This is a nice movie. It’s frisky and cheerful, even when tears are on the way. But it isn’t a very good movie, mainly because, like its heroine, it’s reluctant to make up its mind about what it wants to be. The rough, lived-in, naturalistic look belies a soft sitcom heart, and every foray into risky emotional territory prefigures a retreat into cliché. It turns out that Megan, rather than finally negotiating a passage to independence, is just moving from one dude to another, trading in a needy man-child for a daddy.“Laggies” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Even by the end, it hasn’t made a good case for its existence. Still, Hope Litoff’s documentary becomes more voyeuristically gripping as it progresses.Ms. Litoff, a film editor, begins by investigating the storage space filled with the belongings of her sister, Ruth, an artist who committed suicide in 2008. Hope wants to find something illuminating, though the prospect that Ruth, who had a long history of mental illness, left some sort of Rosebud is a dubious proposition.Still, “32 Pills” makes clear how Ruth’s personality, coupled with her seemingly endless photographs, writings and drawings, created the temptation. The film explores the notion that the sisters were troubled in different ways. And as the excavation continues, predictably — maybe even subconsciously — Hope’s own health issues resurface.A recovered alcoholic, Hope shoots chilling video-diary footage of her first drink in 16 years. She pops two pills from a table covered with her sister’s leftover prescription medication bottles. “There’s something about the fact that they’re Ruth’s pills that make them feel more special to me,” she says. Her producer, Beth Levison, who is present, expresses alarm about becoming an enabler.The exchange sums up what’s queasily fascinating about “32 Pills.” Without Hope’s relapse, the movie would be too personal: something for family, friends and a therapist. But the more Hope’s own obsession grows, the more involving the movie gets, even as it raises ethical questions about its making — and about those who continue to watch.",0,,,0

Before they pack up the bear traps and latex flesh, though, they’ve left us a digestif: “Saw 3D,” the seventh and presumably last film in the series.The “Saw” franchise has always produced meretricious garbage, with a claim to moral complexity that serves as a fig leaf while we enjoy the sight of limbs being hacked off and heads exploding. (The standard reaction in theaters to these payoff scenes is laughter and cheers.) The one distinctive thing about the films has been their Dadaist quality, brought about by a concentration on elaborate, self-referential game-playing at the expense of story and logic.Kevin Greutert’s “Saw 3D,” focused on tying up loose ends and bringing the tale full circle, is probably the most straightforward of the seven films and most consistently (though not inventively) violent. Sean Patrick Flanery, new to the series, plays this episode’s designated hypocrite, whose sin is pretending to be a victim of the serial torturer and killer Jigsaw to profit from the connection. He is sent on the traditional race against time, trying to save a series of people from flesh-rending machines by inflicting pain on himself, in a ritual that recalls the levels of a video game or the Stations of the Cross.Meanwhile, the “Saw” metanarrative works itself out, helped by the usual copious flashbacks, and nearly everyone ends up dead or chained to a toilet.Costas Mandylor is back as Hoffman, who took over the primary punishment duties from Jigsaw around “Saw V,” and the genre queen Betsy Russell makes her fifth appearance as Jigsaw’s former wife. Tobin Bell gets to play Jigsaw for the seventh time, even though his character died in “Saw III,” and to really make it old bloody home week, Cary Elwes returns as Doctor Gordon, the guy who got things started back in 2004 by sawing off his own foot.Be aware: if you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you’ll come away with a pretty good idea of what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face.“Saw 3D” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for entrails.Saw 3DOpened on Friday nationwide.

O. SCOTT,A Dog and His Boy Take a Joy Ride Through History,"If you think of “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” as the latest attempt to turn small-screen baby boomer nostalgia into big-screen fun, you have plenty of reason to be afraid. Hollywood’s obsession with cashing in on old television shows has yielded a grim harvest — remember Nicole Kidman in “Bewitched”? Sorry to have reminded you — and the work of Jay Ward has been singled out for particular abuse. Ward, who died in 1989 and whose brainy cartoons were staples of the early space age, has been dishonored by lame live-action movie versions of Rocky and Bullwinkle, George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right. Luckily, “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” about a supersmart dog and his adopted human son, breaks the curse and respects the nutty, nerdy humor of the original. This DreamWorks Animation production, directed by Rob Minkoff (“Stuart Little,” “The Lion King”) from a screenplay by Craig Wright, is not perfect, but it is fast-moving, intermittently witty and pretty good fun.Mr. Peabody, voiced by Ty Burrell (Phil Dunphy of “Modern Family”), is a Harvard graduate, a Nobel laureate and a lover of puns. He and Sherman (Max Charles) live in a Manhattan penthouse equipped with a time machine called the WABAC. Devotees of the old series will recall the many trips the two-dimensional, hand-drawn father and son made into the past, and the silly (but not altogether ridiculous) history lessons that ensued. Somewhat younger viewers will be reminded of Bill and Ted, but, in any case, the best parts of “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” are encounters with such storied figures as Marie Antoinette, Leonardo da Vinci, King Tut and the Trojan horse.Much of the humor in these sequences is, in the modern manner, action-, celebrity-voice-over- and excrement-based, but enough of Ward’s cracked erudition survives to make intellectually insecure grown-ups and precocious children feel smart. The adventures are built to justify the 3-D ticket upcharge, so there is a lot of roller-coasterish swooping and flying and falling. Most of it lacks the sublimity of “Up” or the gravity-defying rush of “How to Train Your Dragon,” but some of the sequences — notably, a flight over Florence in one of Leonardo’s contraptions — are both funny and exciting.The recipe for modern family entertainment also calls for a dollop of strained sentimentality, here provided by challenges, internal and external, to Sherman and Mr. Peabody’s domestic harmony. After an incident at Sherman’s school, a nasty bureaucrat named Ms. Grunion (Allison Janney) threatens to remove the boy from his dad’s care. And Sherman himself (who is not very convincingly supposed to be 7) shows signs of rebelliousness. His genius father has always taken care of everything, which may have smothered the child’s creativity. All this is resolved in a teary, mercifully short set of speeches at the end, affirming the importance of family love and the need for even highly competent canine parents to recognize their children’s independence. But while the filmmakers have updated jokes and themes about dogs and boys, their ideas about boys and girls have a musty, regressive feel. At school, Sherman meets Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter; her parents are voiced by Leslie Mann and Stephen Colbert), a blond-haired, blue-eyed pixie who parrots incorrect information about George Washington in the classroom. Penny’s job in the course of the film is to be mean to Sherman, to get him into trouble, to be rescued by him, and then to marvel at his resourcefulness and bravery. During the airborne scene in Florence, she helps him become “the first man to fly.” The main historical women in the movie are the gluttonous Marie Antoinette and the frivolous Mona Lisa. It is odd that big-studio animators have taken so long to get to “Frozen” and to “Brave,” and more than a little dispiriting that otherwise imaginative father-son stories like “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” and “The Lego Movie” default to sexism and tokenism. You would think they would be smarter than that, but I guess even a clever old dog has trouble learning new tricks.“Mr. Peabody & Sherman” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

That goes for the gaudy and glorious flora, the gathering clouds and the wind stirring them, all of which were created, with various degrees of believability, via computers. The child playing Mowgli — the human orphan turned wolf child — is played by an actual kid, who frolics with computer-generated critters, a smart call, given that animals can be tricky to work with and that some of this menagerie’s real-life equivalents are (sorry to be a bummer) endangered.Studios are in the recycling business, and while this “The Jungle Book” is lightly diverting, it is also disappointing, partly because it feels like a pumped-up version of Disney’s 1967 animated film, with more action and less sweetness. It also feels strangely removed from our moment. About the only thing that feels of today is that its lush and arid environments and padding paws were digitally created. The resulting look, pitched between photorealism and impressionism, hovers between the realistic and the uncanny. It turns out that the movie was shot in a Los Angeles warehouse, which paradoxically seems like an old-fashioned way to make worlds.Disney’s first version opened in the United States a year after the country created its first list of endangered species. The studio may not have been thinking of “Silent Spring,” Rachel Carson’s 1962 environmental shocker, but “The Jungle Book” hinges on a barefoot child who lives in a furry, fanged commune right out of a pastoral idyll. The film features tangy vocal performances, hand-drawn animation and the ear-worming ditty “The Bare Necessities.” But it also has queasy-making passages, none more so than the scene in which Louis Prima, as the orangutan King Louie, sings a Dixieland version of “I Wanna Be Like You” — “An ape like me/Can learn to be human, too” — which the songwriters Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman wrote with Louis Armstrong in mind.Richard M. Sherman later said that Disney rejected casting a black man, fearing potential trouble with the N.A.A.C.P. For all the ostensible timelessness of its storytelling, Disney has always made movies that speak to its audiences and the world they live in. Even so, it’s hard not to squirm through the number with Prima’s scatting ape because of the troubling signifiers it throws out. At the same time, the film partly alleviates, however unwittingly, Rudyard Kipling’s weighty colonialist baggage, both by giving Mowgli, an Indian child, a golly-gee American voice, and by casting George Sanders as the villainous tiger, Shere Khan, who sounds just as you would expect a world-weary British royal to sound after centuries of pillaging. So, a mixed Disney bag, as usual, with a hippie kid, confusing politics and fuzzy-wuzzies.Directed by Jon Favreau, the busy redo continues Hollywood’s infatuation with British actors, though this time it’s Idris Elba who puts the purr into Shere Khan. Much like the 1967 movie, this one has a loose relationship with the Kipling tales, originally published in 1894. It’s no surprise, given Kipling’s gravity, that the 2016 movie sticks close to the first film in its boyish bounce and sunny vibe. Written by Justin Marks, it opens with Mowgli (Neel Sethi) as a prepubescent, racing alongside his protector, the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), who years earlier placed him in the care of a mother wolf, Raksha (Lupita Nyong’o). Much of the story involves Shere Khan’s plotting against Mowgli amid adventures with Baloo the bear (Bill Murray), Kaa the snake (Scarlett Johansson) and others.Shere Khan is still the baddie, but now he’s lethally, instead of imperiously, cool, which seems unfair, given that Bengal tigers are endangered. The rest of the adult animals, meanwhile, largely register as noble, particularly the elephants that Bagheera and Mowgli bow down before. In the 1967 film, the elephants are amusingly buffoonish and march in a pachyderm parade as their leader invokes his time with the maharajah. The 2016 movie doesn’t refer directly to our environmental catastrophes, including the decimation of the elephant population. Yet when Bagheera now instructs Mowgli to bow before the elephants, it feels as if the filmmakers were gesturing to the truth that this fantasy and its relation to the real world are now tragically different from what they were in Kipling’s time.And when Mowgli helps out the elephants, there’s a suggestion that humans can play their part in their rescue, which is a comforting moral for the children who are this movie’s main audience. At the same time, it would be heartening if Disney took a more environmentally aware stance in the sequel that’s already been discussed, especially given that the company’s brand owes as much to the natural world as to princesses. In recent years, the Disney princess has undergone a radical makeover, evolving into a can-do figure who exists in that cinematic sweet spot between her fantastical world and our real one. The studio’s animal kingdom could use a comparable makeover.In the Kipling stories, every creature abides by the Law of the Jungle, a decree that’s been read as a proxy for British imperialist rule. Both the 1967 and 2016 Mowglis, by contrast, live under the Law of Disney, which dictates that humans can exist with nature, as long as nature isn’t too wild. There’s an argument to be made against that kind of cuddly domination of nature. Yet it’s also true that generations have grown up loving and respecting animals (as animals, not just human surrogates) because of the peaceable kingdom that Disney has created. Here’s hoping that next time Mowgli shows up onscreen, he trades in his four-legged foe for some two-legged villains — before the only wild worlds we have left are computer-generated.“The Jungle Book” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for child and animal action-movie peril.

O. SCOTT,The Lady or the Teddy?,"There is really only one joke in “Ted” — a toy bear comes to life and turns out to have a filthy mouth and a taste for weed — but the movie’s attempts at humor can nonetheless be sorted into a few distinct categories. There are jokes that are funny only because a stuffed bear says them, jokes that are not funny even though a stuffed bear says them and jokes that may or may not be funny because of Mark Wahlberg. Mila Kunis is also in the movie, but she can’t be funny because she’s a girl, and her job is to be amused, tolerant and pretty.Tolerant amusement is pretty much the best this harmless little picture, directed by Seth MacFarlane from a script he wrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is able to manage, even though it strives for obnoxious hilarity. The cleverly animated ursine title character, voiced in an exaggerated Boston bray by Mr. MacFarlane himself, is a fire hose of vulgarity, ethnic insult, homophobia and misogyny. In the modern, meta manner he (that is, Mr. MacFarlane) wants both to indulge and to deny the offensiveness of this material, to wallow in ugliness and make fun of it too. It’s a wasted effort though. The sin of “Ted” is not that it is offensive but that it is boring, lazy and wildly unoriginal. If Triumph the Insult Comic Dog ever got a hold of Ted, there would be nothing left but a pile of fluff and a few scraps of fur.Mr. MacFarlane is best known as the creator of “Family Guy,” an animated television series that has hung around in the company of “The Simpsons” and “South Park” like an annoying younger cousin, bullying and whining its way into a measure of public acceptance. The show shares with “Ted” a devotion to laughter based on incongruity: the baby who sounds like an English aristocrat; the dog who talks like a bored intellectual; the teddy bear with the voice of the guy who spilled beer down the back of your shirt at the Bruins game.Balancing these inventions are sturdy stereotypes. In other words, the guy at the Bruins game is in the movie too, in the person of Mr. Wahlberg, who settles amiably into the role of an affable underachiever memorably named John. A cute opening sequence chronicles the granting of John’s childhood wish that his beloved bear come to life and the flurry of media attention that followed. In the present John is 35, employed at a Boston car-rental office and romantically attached to Lori (Ms. Kunis).She is a good enough sport to accept her boyfriend’s underachieving ways and his devotion to his fluffy best bud, in spite of the skepticism of her friends and the amorous attention of her boss (Joel McHale). But circumstances and John’s own passivity conspire to force him to make a painful choice: the lady or the bear.Meanwhile, to pad out the meager plot, Ted is menaced by a creepy guy (Giovanni Ribisi) with a creepy mustache and a creepy son (Aedin Mincks). Sexual and flatulence-based gags are accompanied by the usual side dishes: warmed-over pop-cultural references and cheap-shot jabs at celebrities and ethnic minorities. Fans of “Flash Gordon,” a kitschy early-’80s attempt to ride the coattails of the “Star Wars” movies, will be especially tickled. Admirers of Norah Jones, who shows up briefly, may on the other hand, be puzzled.But not offended. There are some genuinely, wildly funny bits in the movie — a brutal motel-room fistfight between Ted and John; a cocaine-fueled talking binge; a few choice insults and smutty riffs — but the feature film is not a hospitable form for Mr. MacFarlane. He has no particular visual knack, little interest in storytelling and nothing better to do with his naughty bear besides stuff him into a soft, sentimental comedy that seems almost proud of its lack of wit or conviction.“Ted” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

811,2012-06-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:15,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"Of Saints and Sinners, in a Fevered Mexico","“For Greater Glory,” an old-fashioned, Hollywood-style epic that overlays thundering hoof beats with a humid layer of piety, remembers the Cristero War, a bitter 20th-century conflict in which persecuted Roman Catholics rose up against the anticlerical Mexican government.Largely played down by history books, the war, waged between 1926 and 1929, cost about 90,000 lives. Pope John Paul II later canonized more than two dozen saints and martyrs who fought on the Catholic side.The movie is a much softer echo of fervent 1950s blockbusters with religious themes, like “The Robe,” set at the dawn of Christianity, in which humble true believers who are ready to sacrifice their lives for their faith stand up to their godless oppressors. The best of those quasi-biblical movies still have the power to stir the blood and elicit tears. Mel Gibson has more recently made angrier and gorier versions of the same thing.There may be no miracles or choirs of angels here, but religiosity, although restrained, is pervasive. Pablo José Barroso, the film’s producer, founded Dos Corazones Films, a Mexican production company that the press notes state was “created as part of a ministry that produces films to convey messages of faith and family values.”Dean Wright, who directed “For Greater Glory” from a screenplay by Michael Love, was the visual effects wizard behind the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. This movie, which was filmed on many of the actual sites of the conflict, is impressively spacious. The expansive scale and brisk but unhurried editing keep “For Greater Glory” from stumbling over itself and becoming a bloated, grandiose exhibition of righteous saber rattling. The symphonic score by James Horner confers an inspirational mood that is uplifting without being syrupy.Even if “For Greater Glory” is considerably more sophisticated than some of its forerunners, its characters are clear-cut saints and sinners. To its credit, the film acknowledges the political history leading up to the war and the bargaining behind the scenes. Bruce Greenwood plays Dwight Morrow, the United States ambassador to Mexico, dispatched from Washington to protect American oil interests while brokering a peace.But the diplomacy is just a footnote to the struggle for religious freedom. The conflict, which had been simmering for years, erupted when the Mexican president, Plutarco Elias Calles (Rubén Blades), expanded and began brutally enforcing the anticlerical laws of the country’s 1917 constitution. Early scenes show soldiers on horseback breaking into churches, killing priests and destroying church property. Dead bodies are strung up along railroad tracks.One of the first priests executed is Father Christopher (Peter O’Toole), a rheumy-eyed peace-loving cleric who takes José (Mauricio Kuri), a mischievous boy, under his wing after José lobs a piece of fruit at him. A witness to Father Christopher’s murder, José leaves his family to venture into the countryside, where he joins forces with the rebels and becomes the surrogate son of Enrique Gorostieta (Andy Garcia), a retired general and brilliant tactician hired by the leaders of the country’s ragtag Catholic militias to organize them into a unified army.Gorostieta, a nonbeliever who champions religious freedom, is running a soap factory when the invitation comes. For a hefty fee, he agrees to develop a strategy based on carefully planned ambushes. Although Gorostieta has a deeply religious wife, Tulita (Eva Longoria, unrecognizable and barely seen in the film), he shares a passionate father-son bond with José that forms the movie’s emotional core.The boy’s arrest and persecution are staged as a kind of passion play exploited for maximum teary-eyed outrage. This beautiful, fearless young warrior, who refuses to renounce his faith while under torture, is forced to walk barefoot with slashed feet to his own execution. (José was later canonized.)Mr. Garcia, who sheds copious tears over the boy, is a solid and convincing hero humanized by the attachment. The movie also portrays Gorostieta as edging toward Catholic conversion without actually making the commitment.Even at 143 minutes, “For Greater Glory” cannot satisfyingly fill out the stories of a half-dozen secondary characters, and there are frustrating gaps in the biographies of Gorostieta and José. The jamming together of so much history and melodrama makes for a handsome movie that is only rarely gripping.“For Greater Glory” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The dudes in these movies tend to observe a ritualistic narrative proximity (they get close, but not too close) that’s echoed in the physical protocols of the typical bro-hug. In these familiar ceremonial interactions, the bros lean in toward each other for some upper-body contact even as they simultaneously maintain scrupulous, observable genital distance. Once contact is made, the bro-huggers exchange two or three hearty back slaps and then uncouple. In the comedy “The D Train,” there’s no such retreat — only sweet, sweaty surrender. A genial movie about how we live now or like to think that we do, “The D Train” stars Jack Black as Dan Landsman, an outwardly ordinary Joe who’s helping to plan his 20th high school reunion. His testy dealings with the other reunion committee members suggest that he was as unpopular in high school as he is now. He’s not a bad guy, but more of a fussbudgety blowhard who’s always trying too hard to be the big man, often through trivial means like scatting slang and being keeper of a reunion password. When he sees one of the school’s former golden boys, Oliver Lawless (a nimble, perfect James Marsden), in a television commercial, Dan decides to try to persuade him to come to the reunion.Dan dreams, as you see in an amusing Walter Mitty-like fantasy, that landing Oliver will turn him into the conquering reunion hero. The writer-directors Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel don’t make Dan a full-blown fantasist and, crucially, unlike Mitty, Dan isn’t victimized by one of those classic pecking hens. His issues are largely of his own grandiose design but also fairly picayune. He’s carved out his own version of the American dream and appears happily married with a supportive wife, Stacey (Kathryn Hahn), and two children, as well as contentedly employed. (Jeffrey Tambor plays his boss.) It’s perfectly ordinary if also not enough for Dan who, with can-do resolve, flies to Los Angeles, where he finds Oliver. There, over several days and feverish nights, they bond big time, including in bed. For long stretches, “The D Train” serves as a commodious vehicle for Mr. Black, who, like the best comic performers, never seems remotely concerned about going too big or risking the audience’s love. He’s a showboat if every so often, more of a steamroller, capable of flattening everyone and everything in his way. Yet he is also adept at conveying emotional and psychological fragility, and there are some nice moments here when you see Dan as confused by his feelings for Oliver as a crushed-out 12-year-old, which the filmmakers smartly don’t try to explain. Instead, they show you what Dan sees and in the process upend the old formulation (often attributed to Raymond Chandler about James Bond) that while men want to be the handsome hero, it’s only the women who want to be with him.“The D Train” isn’t the first comedy to coax laughs out of two ostensibly straight guys having sex, a situation more typically found in seriously unfunny prison movies. The 2009 indie movie “Humpday,” a sendup of the genre, circled the issue with two straight male friends who decide to make a pornographic movie with each other only to keep their penises in lockdown. That’s invariably the case in the typical bromances, of course, which feature delineated straight guys who engage in stereotypically, even hyperbolically coded male behavior: They play air guitar, drink to excess, become involved in street altercations and so forth. One of the best, “I Love You, Man,” even mimics the classic heterosexual romantic coupling: Boy meets boy; boy loses boy; boy gets boy, kind of.With light and moderately dark comic flourishes, a skipping, sometimes thudding heart and some careful lighting, “The D Train” takes the bromance to its logical conclusion. Even so, it plays it sweet rather than tough, including narratively, and there are instances — as in a close-up of Dan, his face knotted up in jealousy as he watches Oliver across a dance floor — when you see hints of a more dangerous, less comfortable movie. “The D Train” acknowledges there can be more to all the usual sharing, caring and relentless joking than the reproduction of male power, but it isn’t going to upturn the status quo. The truth is that it’s pretty straight, including in its revelation that sometimes when a guy says “I love you, man,” he really, really means it. “The D Train” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Some of these are just the flesh-and-blood people in Norman’s life, the bullies and teachers and even relatives who, with degrees of impatience and love, chastise the 11-year-old for his unusually morbid habits. Norman, a sprout whose black hair stands at attention as if he were in a state of perpetual alarm (he is voiced with vivid emotion by Kodi Smit-McPhee), can’t help but be a little creepy. After all, he doesn’t just see dead people, he also hangs out with them, sometimes while watching creature-features on the family TV.And why not, especially given that the old lady busily knitting on the sofa in a lovely pool of bilious green is Norman’s grandmother and voiced by the incomparable Elaine Stritch? No one explains how Grandma, with her watery form and needles, died, but she herself says she’s sticking around to keep an eye on him. It’s a good thing, too, given that no one else can see what Norman sees and everyone, except for his gossamer granny and the assembly of loitering ghosts who jauntily greet him on his way to school, seems to think he’s a nut. From the outside there really doesn’t seem to be much difference between Norman and a lot of under-age movie heroes. He’s diffident, misjudged, withdrawn. The best thing about him, besides his looks, is that he may actually be a nut.This is the second stop-motion animated feature from Laika, the Oregon studio that produced “Coraline” (2009), which was directed by Henry Selick and based on the Neil Gaiman novella. “ParaNorman” comes with somewhat less familiar brand names: Sam Fell, who shares directing credit on “ParaNorman” with its screenwriter, Chris Butler, helped direct both “Flushed Away” (from Aardman Animations, the British home of Wallace & Gromit) and “The Tale of Despereaux” (from Universal Pictures). Like the Aardman movies, “ParaNorman” was made with physical puppets and sets, and an almost tenderly stubborn insistence on the human touch. Computers figured into its production, as they do on virtually every movie made these days, but an enormous amount of handiwork was also involved, effort that’s visible, for instance, in the meaningful lopsidedness of Norman’s nostrils and ears.Everything’s somewhat askew in “ParaNorman,” including at Norman’s home, where it can be hard for him to assert his individuality and quirks, a struggle made amusingly literal in a shot in which he’s bookended by the plumped derrière of his loving mother, Sandra (Leslie Mann), and the rounded belly of his exasperated father, Perry (Jeff Garlin). Rather less amusing is Norman’s snappish older sister, Courtney (Anna Kendrick), a bubble-gum-pink nightmare who, like the blustering bully at school, Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), initially registers as disappointingly generic. There’s somewhat more to both Courtney and Alvin, though over all the designs of all the characters, from their globular and angular parts to their blotchy skin, are more inspired than what lies beneath.Norman himself is an appealing figure, from bristled hair to sneakered toe, partly because he hasn’t been saddled with the familiar Disneyesque pluck and good cheer. He’s a morose boy, watchful and wary, with a darting gaze and hunched shoulders. The outsider hero, alone and misunderstood, has become an even bigger cliché in American movies than the old-fashioned nonneurotic protagonist was once upon a studio time. Norman certainly has demons (and zombies), but he isn’t just a bundle of idiosyncrasies waiting for his redemptive glory, a therapeutic reckoning and a tribe of kooks to call his own (though do expect the expected). He’s also an unreconstructed little weirdo, with pleasurably odd tics and a night light shaped like a monster head and topped with a pink brain.The story, an amusing if not especially fresh tale involving a witch and some Puritans, is principally a vehicle for the movie’s meticulously detailed pictorial beauty, which turns each scene into an occasion for discovery and sometimes delight. Far more than Norman’s adventure, which takes him from home to a cemetery and deep into his town’s history, what pulls you in, quickening your pulse and widening your eyes, are the myriad visual enchantments — from the rich, nubby tactility of his clothes to the skull-and-bones adorning his bedroom wallpaper. When Norman pauses while brushing his teeth to make a scary face in the mirror, the foamy toothpaste dripping like zombie drool, you may find yourself tapping into your own inner monster and goofily grinning right back.“ParaNorman” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There are a few action-filled scenes, including one with the very angry ghost of a murdered child, which may be too intense for some young viewers.",1,55994557.0,56003051.0,1

O. SCOTT,An Everyman’s Guide to Engineering a Jail Break,"One of the strictures of the old Motion Picture Production Code was that “methods of crime should not be explicitly presented” and that in particular, “theft, robbery, safe-cracking, and dynamiting of trains, mines, buildings, etc., should not be detailed in method.” The censors of the Hays Office did not want motion pictures to become teaching materials for criminals. “The Next Three Days,” a new thriller written and directed by Paul Haggis, is in many respects an old-fashioned movie, but it also amounts to a kind of cinematic “Illegal Activity for Dummies.”Or maybe a violent, feature-length version of one of those once-hot cable television makeover shows. Here, a regular guy named John (Russell Crowe) is transformed into a scheming mastermind, planning and executing not a simple safe-cracking, but rather a daring and logistically complex jail break. He doesn’t acquire the requisite skills by watching movies, though. That’s what the Internet is for. This unassuming Pittsburgh dad — he makes his living mumbling about Don Quixote to students at a local community college — combs YouTube for videos showing how to forge skeleton keys and break into cars with a tennis ball. On Amazon, he tracks down the memoir of a man who broke out of seven prisons, then goes to interview the guy, played by Liam Neeson with a dodgy Brooklyn accent, a decorative scar and a thousand-yard stare.John’s actions, which bring him into contact with all kinds of nasty characters (including drug dealers played by RZA and Kevin Corrigan) and eventually arouse the suspicions of the police (mainly Aisha Hinds, Jason Beghe and Allan Steele), are certainly not what you would expect of a college instructor played by anyone other than Mr. Crowe. Our man’s motives, however, could hardly be more noble. One fine morning, John’s wife, Lara (Elizabeth Banks), is snatched up by the cops and hauled off to jail, charged with murdering the boss she had argued with the night before.Three years pass quickly (in about 15 minutes of screen time), and by the time his wife’s last appeal has been denied, John, certain of her innocence, finds himself driven to an extreme and elaborate display of spousal loyalty. He takes pictures, draws maps, buys a gun and some false passports, and plans a one-man assault on the Allegheny County Jail. Their young son, Luke (Ty Simpkins), wonders what Dad is up to, but he never raises a fuss. John’s parents (Helen Carey and Brian Dennehy) accept spontaneous baby-sitting assignments without complaint.In his quiet, brooding roles (of which this is surely one), Mr. Crowe carries the possibility of violence coiled within him, and one of the problems with “The Next Three Days” is that John’s menace and desperation are visible from the start, so that the occasional displays of uncertainty and anxiety are not quite convincing. Nor, when you stop to think about it, is most of the rest of the movie, which remakes a 2008 French movie called “Pour Elle.” I don’t mean that the story is implausible — if I were a professor in Pittsburgh with a diabetic wife in the hoosegow, I would certainly figure out how to falsify her medical records — but rather that all the emphasis on technique starves the drama of psychological intensity.What about Lara? The structure of the film, which skips over the details of the trial and flashes back teasingly to the crime itself, allows for some ambiguity about her guilt. But Ms. Banks is never given enough time on-screen to complete the portrait that might make this uncertainty mean something. Is this woman capable of bludgeoning someone to death with a fire extinguisher? The court says yes, her husband says no, but Mr. Haggis does not let us see the shadows of her personality that would make this argument interesting.Nor does he exploit the absurdist, almost comic themes that are latent in the film’s premise. An intellectual with a closet full of corduroy jackets and a Prius is transformed by Kafkaesque circumstances into an outlaw — there is all kinds of potential here, but Mr. Haggis lacks the Hitchcockian sense of mischief to make it blossom. His work as a director (“Crash,” “In the Valley of Elah”) and as a screenwriter (“Million Dollar Baby”) has never been distinguished by humor, and that, somewhat paradoxically, is what a movie like “The Next Three Days” needs if it is to be taken seriously. Otherwise it’s not much more than a meticulously detailed, very long instructional video.“The Next Three Days” is rated PG-13  (Parents strongly cautioned). Guns. Drugs. Crime.

815,2015-06-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:21,A. O. SCOTT,Review: &#8216;Love &amp; Mercy&#8217; Gets Inside Brian Wilson&#8217;s Head,"The first thing you see in “Love & Mercy” is an extreme close-up of Brian Wilson’s ear. It’s a startling image, and it holds out a twofold promise: that the film will take viewers inside its protagonist’s head and that it will pay particular attention to the role that sound played in his life.For the most part, this movie, a smart, compassionate, refreshingly unconventional biopic directed by Bill Pohlad, makes good on both promises, exploring the mental world and the artistic method of a great artist. It’s a loving tribute to the Beach Boys and the man responsible for their distinctive sound, but it goes to deeper and stranger places than most movies of its kind. On screen, the lives of musicians tend to follow a tried-and-true outline: A rise to fame is followed by a personal and professional crisis, often involving drugs, which is followed by a redemptive third act. What is often missing from the formula is any real insight into the reason we might be interested in the first place, which is the music. We might see our idol, more or less persuasively impersonated by a hard-working actor, strumming a guitar or noodling at a piano, but the complicated labor of creativity is notoriously hard to show on screen.Mr. Pohlad, an accomplished producer who had the cooperation of Mr. Wilson and his wife, Melinda, doesn’t just overcome this challenge; he makes witnessing the creation of a record as exciting as hearing a classic song for the first time. One of the best things about “Love & Mercy,” which was written by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, is how long it lingers in the recording studio, observing as Brian, played in his 20s by Paul Dano, is putting together “Pet Sounds,” by consensus one of the great albums of its era.The attention to detail in these scenes provides a feast for geeks of all kinds, as the camera lovingly ogles microphones, amplifiers and consoles that were state of the art in the mid-1960s. Watching Brian, with his boyish face and eager puppy-dog manner, adjusting the knobs and directing the session players, is like watching a kid in a toy store. He is freer and more confident than ever before, layering and sculpting improbable instruments and bewitching harmonies into songs that are at once exquisitely simple and astonishingly sophisticated.The making of “Pet Sounds” is the centerpiece of “Love & Mercy.” It also represents a plateau of calm and control in the midst of a life full of chaos and pain. Instead of telling the story in full, the film shifts back and forth — fluidly and seamlessly — from the ’60s to the ’80s, when Brian, now played by John Cusack, first meets Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), in a Cadillac showroom in Los Angeles. Their courtship is complicated by the presence of Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), a psychologist who serves as Brian’s guru, dietitian and legal guardian.Working together — but also in isolation from each other, like musicians in separate recording booths — Mr. Cusack and Mr. Dano create a remarkable composite performance, a set of before-and-after pictures that is also a perfectly unified, hauntingly complex portrait. Mr. Dano, gentle and inscrutable as a panda bear, conveys the pathos of a young man’s unraveling. The Beach Boys were a family business, including Brian’s brothers Carl (Brett Davern) and Dennis (Kenny Wormald) and their cousin Mike Love (Jake Abel). Their rise, chronicled in a lively montage of early hits, was overseen by Murry Wilson (Bill Camp), an abusive patriarch who hung around to undermine and humiliate his sons, Brian in particular, even after being fired as the group’s manager.The movie is careful not to push too far into Freudian psychodrama. Brian’s mental collapse is not directly attributed to his abusive father or to the pressures of fame. At a certain point, the sounds in his head take on a sinister cast, and his odd behavior and paranoid ramblings frighten his bandmates and his first wife, Marilyn (Erin Darke). LSD doesn’t help. By the time he meets Melinda, though, his breakdown is in the past. He strikes her as a sweet, soft-spoken eccentric, a pampered rich guy who is also kind and vulnerable. He shocks her sometimes by referring almost casually to the trauma and abuse in his past and gradually reveals the terror that governs his present-day life.If the ’60s half of “Love & Mercy” is, in part, a trippy excursion into a golden piece of the California past, the ’80s section is a spooky Los Angeles noir. Told almost entirely from Melinda’s perspective, it follows her discovery of the hidden, sinister dimensions of Dr. Landy’s apparent benevolence. A jolly, friendly fellow on the surface, Landy is both a one-of-a-kind creep (Mr. Giamatti’s smile will give you nightmares, as will his hair) and a recognizable type of villain. Melinda, whose sunny disposition masks a steely, icy resolve, makes a very satisfying foil, and Ms. Banks’s astute performance, in a series of eye-catching period-appropriate outfits, is what binds the film together. Melinda is the only person who can love and appreciate Brian for who he is, and as such she is the stand-in for the rest of us, who admire what he accomplished.This film deepens that appreciation and illuminates its sources. Mr. Pohlad’s deft narrative sense and careful visual style are complemented by the work of Atticus Ross, whose sonic collages —“score” doesn’t quite do justice to his achievement — take us deeper inside a musical mind than we might have thought possible. “Love & Mercy” doesn’t claim to solve the mystery of Brian Wilson, but it succeeds beyond all expectation in making you hear where he was coming from.“Love & Mercy” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Not all the vibrations are good.",1,,,1

Mr. Girardin catches him as he trains to break the speed record for his age group, following him from studio to home to Italy, where they visit Mr. Marinoni’s village before heading to the velodrome where the attempt takes place.For all the access he grants, Mr. Marinoni is not very open. It’s left to his fans to attest to his bikes’ superior quality — and his cranky ways. And aside from calling it a passion, Mr. Marinoni doesn’t explain what captivates him about bicycles and cycling, or what drives him on this record quest. A chronicle of obsession ought to provide some insights.A glimpse is supplied by Jocelyn Lovell, a onetime champion Canadian cyclist whose career ended horrifically when he was hit by a truck in 1983. Left a quadriplegic, Mr. Lovell speaks of cycling the way Louis Armstrong did of jazz — if you have to ask, you’ll never know. In his bid for the record, Mr. Marinoni uses a bike he built for Mr. Lovell four decades earlier, and it’s the meeting of these men after so many years that provides the soul for this machine.",0,4696.0,,0

O. SCOTT,"Twinkly Totems of Fame, Theirs for the Taking","In her last two movies — the sublime “Somewhere” and the seductive “Marie Antoinette” — Sofia Coppola has focused her rigorous attention on characters living inside bubbles of privilege, fairy tale precincts where the invisible magic of wealth and power makes wishes come true. Stephen Dorff’s drifting movie star and Kirsten Dunst’s capricious young queen both lead pampered existences of a kind that make them easy objects of envy and resentment, but Ms. Coppola examines them with detached, quiet sympathy, refusing to mock or judge. She anatomizes the spiritual conditions of people who might have seemed to be case studies in shallow, carefree materialism.“The Bling Ring,” her new feature (and her fifth over all), continues in this vein from a somewhat different perspective. It is not about the paralysis of having more than you could possibly want, but rather about the addictive thrills of wanting what you can’t quite have and trying to get it. The Southern California teenagers at the center of the movie do not reside in a bubble of money and celebrity, though they are not exactly outsiders, either. They can see through the membrane and touch its shiny, thin surface. They can even reach inside.Mostly rich kids with access to cars, drugs and Internet gossip sites, these low-affect rebels hang out at clubs frequented by Hollywood’s gilded youth — at one point Ms. Dunst herself floats past their table — and believe that anything not already in their grasp should be. And so they start grabbing, breaking into the surprisingly unprotected homes of the beautiful and glamorous and making off with whatever catches their eye: shoes, dresses, handbags, watches, objets d’art, rolls of cash.It is something other than simple greed that motivates these young thieves, whose leader is a reckless, terrifyingly poised girl named Rebecca (Katie Chang). Already hooked on the rush of petty theft — she casually liberates wallets and purses from cars parked outside a friend’s house during a party — Rebecca is also interested in fame. When she and her new friend Marc (Israel Broussard) pay their first visit to Paris Hilton’s empty mansion, she is not content to help herself to some of the expensive stuff Ms. Hilton has lying around. She wants to linger, to chill, to make herself at home.Rebecca and Marc, who has recently transferred into her high school in the San Fernando Valley, are the nucleus of a gang that also includes Chloe (Claire Julien), a free-spirited classmate, and Nicki (Emma Watson) and Sam (Taissa Farmiga), friends since childhood who are home-schooled by Nicki’s mother (Leslie Mann). Their M.O. is simple and, for a surprisingly long while, foolproof. The Internet tells them when a given celebrity — Orlando Bloom, Audrina Patridge, Lindsay Lohan and Megan Fox, in addition to Ms. Hilton — is out of town hosting a benefit or shooting a movie. Private security patrols are easily evaded, and the doors are never locked.“The Bling Ring,” drawn from an article in Vanity Fair by Nancy Jo Sales, sticks to the contours of a true story that seems to have floated out of the early work of Bret Easton Ellis. There is a whiff of tabloid incredulity in Ms. Coppola’s version of the story, and an occasional crackle of appalled satire. Once the main characters are caught, the explanations they offer are at least as disturbing as the crimes themselves. Nicki, the meanest and most ambitious of the group, views the whole experience as “a learning lesson” that will ultimately help her achieve her goal of leading a major philanthropic organization or “a country, for all I know.” For his part, Marc vaguely blames his low self-esteem (he’s “not ugly,” but also “not A-list”) and society’s obsession with Bonnie-and-Clyde-style outlaws.These moments are funny, and it is often easy to laugh at the blasé attitudes and clueless expressions of the teenage burglars. But “The Bling Ring” is, finally, neither a cautionary tale of youth gone wrong nor a joke at the expense of kids these days. Although Rebecca, Marc and Chloe may be shallow and amoral (Nicki seems more like a true sociopath), they are also acting in the grip of a genuine aesthetic compulsion, feeding an appetite for beauty and intensity that is hardly theirs alone.And while it would be wrong to say that Ms. Coppola shares or approves of their hunger, she does take it seriously. The film, shot by Christopher Blauvelt and the great cinematographer Harris Savides (to whose memory it is dedicated), has a quiet, sensual glow that communicates the lust that drives its characters. By night, the empty homes of the famous — glass boxes hovering in the hills above the Los Angeles Basin; Spanish castles tucked away on leafy streets — become enchanted places, and flashy swag turns into treasure. “The Bling Ring” occupies a vertiginous middle ground between banality and transcendence, and its refusal to commit to one or the other is both a mark of integrity and a source of frustration. The audience is neither inside the experience of the characters nor at a safe distance from them. We don’t know how (or if) they think, and we don’t know quite what to think of them. Are they empty, depraved or opaque? Which would be worse?“The Bling Ring” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

As directed by Brett Ratner, of the “Rush Hour” franchise, and adapted from a graphic novel written by Steve Moore, “Hercules” poses questions better left unasked. What if there were doubt about Hercules’ murder of his family? What if he had an entourage, including Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) — now an Amazon warrior, albeit one who’d kept both breasts? (This is a Ratner film, after all.)“Hercules” is tongue-in-cheek revisionist mythology, pitched at classics students who prefer to attend their lectures stoned. “If you’re going to use those herbs, Amphiaraus, at least share,” says Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), one of Hercules’ associates, as his comrade (Ian McShane) tends a fire.Hercules’ gang of merry mercenaries roves Greece, killing pirates and other fourth-century B.C. riffraff. Their leader (Dwayne Johnson) is past heroism; we glimpse his 12 labors for King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes) in flashback. The group’s latest assignment is to fight for Cotys (John Hurt), a lord working on his expansion plans. Emphasizing tribalism and family treachery, “Hercules” clearly aims to tap into the “Game of Thrones” craze.There are worse goals. Mr. Ratner shows an eye for military formations and spears in 3-D, giving “Hercules” a weight and physicality lacking in “300.” This movie is less flagrantly stupid than Renny Harlin’s “The Legend of Hercules,” which came and went in January. A nimble, insouciant comic actor (“Be Cool,” “Pain & Gain”), Mr. Johnson gets away with wearing the Nemean lion’s head as a battle helmet. But the film mostly fails to make good use of him. As the plot clogs up with foreseeable reversals, wisecrack duties go to Mr. McShane, whose oracular character keeps wrongly predicting his own death. Like Hercules, the movie is plagued by a split identity: It’s half-slog, half-Mel Brooks. “Hercules” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). “Buxom Amazons and exciting bondage,” as a child in the film puts it, plus the Nemean lion, jumping at you in 3-D.",0,,72688614.0,1

Prince Vlad (Luke Evans), raised as a child soldier enslaved to the Turks, has promised his wife (Sarah Gadon) that their son (Art Parkinson) won’t suffer the same fate.When the Turkish sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) orders mass conscription, Vlad does what any regent would do: He asks a vampire (Charles Dance) for superpowers.

At times, the plot makes so little sense (characters interrupt their search for the bleeding hero to nap and take a bath) that you wonder if Mr. Robinson thinks “surreal” and “supernatural” are synonyms. Like “incomprehensible” and “intriguing.”Whatever his intentions for the wishy-washy Sophia (Mischa Barton) — a newly orphaned religious skeptic and connoisseur of the casual ponytail — her default expression of gap-lipped bewilderment, so closely mirroring our own, is rather comforting. Assailed by hackneyed symbols of doomy alienation, including clapping thunder and snatches of old-timey music, Sophia is almost relieved when Adam (Ryan Eggold) accidentally knocks her over on the street and topples her defenses. Who wouldn’t love a guy who can rustle up hot chocolate and marshmallows in the middle of the night?But Adam disappears, leaving bloodstained sheets and an audience unable to recall what he looks like.

It’s getting hard to tell these once-distinct siblings apart. Disney’s latest animated feature, “Big Hero 6,” is a bright, visually sumptuous 3-D computer-animated feature that gives you a bit of an emotional workout. It doesn’t have some of the familiar Disney markers: There are no eardrum-busting anthems or warbling critters, and it isn’t a fairy tale, exactly, mostly because it’s about a boy. It’s a Disney superhero movie with a story from a Marvel comic book, if one rendered with the wit and texture often associated with Pixar, which I guess makes it a Walt Pixar Marvel.That’s certainly a good way to think of Baymax, the big, beautiful, bouncy white robot who toddles, waddles, squeaks and rather more prosaically flies through “Big Hero 6.” As voiced by Scott Adsit (from “30 Rock”), Baymax has a soothing, comforting voice that at first brings to mind the far more creepily insinuating one of HAL 9000, the computer villain from “2001: A Space Odyssey.” But Baymax, much like the movie itself, represents technological optimism at its shiniest and most reassuring. The robot has been created as a “health care companion,” which means that he’s either a furtive endorsement of Obamacare or a criticism of the same, though he’s probably just a futuristic Florence Nightingale that looks like a cuddlier, more streamlined Michelin Man.Directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, “Big Hero 6” opens with a borderline-frenetic action sequence that announces its tone and PG-rated turf with swaggering humor, signaling that this is no once-upon-a time kiddie kingdom. In a dark corner of the whimsically named city of San Fransokyo (it is a small world), a rowdy crowd has gathered for illegal fights in which remote-controlled robot combatants square off. Here, amid cheers, swooping visuals and the score’s pounding beats, the 14-year-old prodigy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) makes like a seasoned hustler with a shark smile and a robot annihilator, a triumph that leads to a getaway, a failed race to the rescue and a stint in jail.Once Hiro has been sprung from jail by his Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph), the story pieces begin sliding into place. Hiro and his older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney), live with Cass above her San Fran-cool bakery and cafe. She’s a disappointingly bland maternal creation, by turns screechy and huggy, and Tadashi isn’t much better, even if he’s a hunky brainiac who studies at an institute of higher nerdiness alongside a Scooby Doo-like posse: a slacker, Fred (a funny T. J. Miller); a tough chick, GoGo (Jamie Chung); a priss, Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez); and a dude with dreads, Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.). The group is as harmoniously balanced as a university diversity committee, and largely distinguished by safe quirks of personality rather than stereotypes and unfunny accents.The designs for these characters are gently exaggerated, with innocuous looks to go with their friendly, unthreatening temperaments. They pale next to Baymax, whose pleasing plumpness and symphony of cartoon sounds — when he walks, his legs produce muffled boing-boing noises — make him the embodiment of kawaii and the Japanese culture of cute. Created by Tadashi, the robot is a palpably tactile and charming screen presence who in time becomes Hiro’s supersize Jiminy Cricket, part folk philosopher, part moral compass. What makes Baymax so memorable and emotionally potent is that he’s also something of a Proustian Marshmallow who triggers an irresistible chain of elemental pleasures: He’s a stuffed animal, a warm blanket, a cozy chair, a warm embrace.Both Baymax and the backgrounds, with their amusing excesses and startling photorealistic detail, make the story seem fairly superfluous, at least until you’ve settled in. Like the portmanteau name San Fransokyo, the movie fuses different source materials, drawing on diverse cultural traditions, urban landscapes, architectural visions and futurist ideas.There are waving good-luck cats, airborne wind turbines that suggest why the air looks so clean and a Golden Gate-like bridge with towers that look like vertically stacked Japanese red gates. Before all the story stuff gets in the way, “Big Hero 6” hums along on the imaginativeness of its visual design and the image of a big squeaky toy navigating city streets with Oliver Hardy roly-polyness and the deadpan of Buster Keaton.Hiro’s journey is rather more pedestrian, resembling that of the classic hero — the writers are Robert L. Baird, Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts — retrofitted to the information age with some space-age filler. Hiro is called to adventure only to refuse that call and then, after receiving help from a magical helper, or rather Baymax, crosses the threshold, enters the belly of the beast and so on. More specifically, a tragedy radically upends Hiro’s world, putting the kibosh on his plans to attend the university and plunging him into a very sad place. He emerges almost by accident when he stumbles across a villain, a discovery that sets him and the story down a path that’s so well-trod it feels discouragingly inescapable: that of the genius turned superhero.It’s too bad that in making its first movie based on a Marvel comic Disney didn’t decide to take a real leap into the future, say, by making Hiro a girl or ditching some of the clichés, like the blowout finale, that make so many superhero movies feel so drearily similar. “Big Hero 6” is good enough to transcend its blah ending and to make the case that every superhero story should be entirely animated. Given the amount of computer-generated imagery in live action superhero movies, why not? Only that for its next comic-book adventure Disney should think about hiring Linda Woolverton, who helped bring its fairy-tale factory into the 21st century with “Maleficent” and might be able to shake things up for its superheroes. Boy characters deserve paradigm shifts, too.“Big Hero 6” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The movie features a death and several fight sequences.",0,,217603425.0,0

SCOTT,"Amid Chants of ‘¡Huelga!,’ an Embodiment of Hope","“Cesar Chavez,” directed by Diego Luna, is a well-cast, well-intentioned movie that falls into the trap that often awaits film biographies of brave and widely admired individuals. The movie is so intent on reminding viewers of its subject’s heroism that it struggles to make him an interesting, three-dimensional person, and it tells his story as a series of dramatic bullet points, punctuated by black-and-white footage, some real, some simulated, of historical events.In spite of these shortcomings, Mr. Luna’s reconstruction of the emergence of the United Farm Workers organization in the 1960s unfolds with unusual urgency and timeliness. After a rushed beginning — in which we see Chavez (Michael Peña) arguing in a Los Angeles office and moving his family to Delano, a central California town, before we fully grasp his motives — we settle in for a long, sometimes violent struggle between the workers and the growers. Attempted strikes are met with intimidation and brutality, from the local sheriff and hired goons, and Chavez and his allies (notably Dolores Huerta, played by Rosario Dawson) come up with new tactics, including a public fast, a march from Delano to Sacramento and a consumer boycott of grapes.As is customary in movies like this, we see the toll that the hero’s commitment takes on his family life. His wife, Helen (America Ferrera), is a steadfast ally, but there is tension between Chavez and his oldest son, Fernando (the only one of the couple’s eight children with more than an incidental presence on screen). Fernando (Eli Vargas) endures racist bullying at school and suffers from his father’s frequent absences. Their scenes together are more functional than heartfelt, fulfilling the requirement of allowing the audience a glimpse at the private life of a public figure.We also venture into the household of one of Chavez’s main antagonists, a landowner named Bogdonovich, played with sly, dry understatement by John Malkovich. He is determined to break the incipient union, and the fight between the two men and their organizations becomes a national political issue. Senator Robert F. Kennedy (Jack Holmes) takes the side of the workers, while the interests of the growers are publicly defended by Ronald Reagan, shown in an archival video clip describing the grape boycott as immoral, and Richard Nixon. Parts of “Cesar Chavez” are as rousing as an old folk song, with chants of “¡Huelga!” and “¡Sí, se puede!” ringing through the theater. Although it ends, as such works usually do, on a note of triumph, the film, whose screenplay is by Keir Pearson and Timothy J. Sexton, does not present history as a closed book. Movies about men and women who fought for social change — “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom” is a recent example — treat them less as the radicals they were than as embodiments of hope, reconciliation and consensus.Though Cesar Chavez, who died in 1993, has been honored and celebrated, the problems he addressed have hardly faded away. The rights of immigrants and the wages and working conditions of those who pick, process and transport food are still live and contentious political issues. And if you read between the lines of Mr. Luna’s earnest, clumsy film, you find not just a history lesson but an argument. The success of the farm workers depended on the strength of labor unions, both in the United States and overseas, and the existence of political parties able to draw on that power. What the film struggles to depict, committed as it is to the conventions of hagiography, is the long and complex work of organizing people to defend their own interests. You are invited to admire what Cesar Chavez did, but it may be more vital to understand how he did it. “Cesar Chavez” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

SCOTT,When There Really Is Not a Drop to Drink,"Jay Famiglietti, one of a handful of expert witnesses in Jessica Yu’s “Last Call at the Oasis,” is a thoughtful scientist with an engaging manner who specializes in water. In particular, he studies — and tries to raise public awareness about — the rapid depletion of water supplies caused by agricultural overuse, rampant development and global climate change. His analyses are thorough and clear, and he presents them, at public meetings and straight to Ms. Yu’s camera, with good-natured patience. For the most part, that is. At one point, contemplating a future of unchecked consumption and political paralysis, he sums it all up in blunt layman’s terms: “We’re screwed.”That might serve as an alternative name for Ms. Yu’s film, or even for the genre to which it belongs. The global-catastrophe documentary is a thriving form these days, as the apparent unsustainability of human life has emerged as fertile ground for cinematic journalism. “Last Call at the Oasis” follows “Payback,” “Surviving Progress” and “The Island President” — to name only some of the most recent releases — in a drumbeat of elemental doom. The food we eat, the stuff we buy, the air we breathe, the fuel we burn, the water we drink: it’s all killing us!Ms. Yu, who has directed scripted television episodes as well as documentaries, wraps a lot of bad news into a slick, informative, fast-moving package. Dwelling mostly on the United States, with forays to Australia and Israel and brief glances at Asia, Africa and South America, she weaves local stories of drought and pollution together with larger-scale explanations of the worldwide water crisis.Dr. Famiglietti and others (notably Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute) take us to the drying-out regions of the West, where competition for water has a long history (as fans of “Chinatown” may recall). Fast-growing Las Vegas, as it drains nearby Lake Mead, contemplates a pipeline to pull water from ranch land in northern Nevada. Conservationists in the San Francisco Bay Area who want to restore rivers and protect fish incur the wrath of farmers in the Central Valley of California, and the specter of less snow in the mountains haunts everyone.In addition to scarcity, there is contamination. Tyrone Hayes, a biologist, shows us mutant frogs, their endocrine systems scrambled by pesticide-borne chemicals. Erin Brockovich visits towns with terrifying rates of cancer, continuing the work that inspired the Oscar-winning film starring Julia Roberts (a few clips of which are shown). Lynn Henning, a Michigan farmer, monitors the toxic runoff from lagoons full of cow manure from huge industrial feedlots.Meanwhile, we clog the waste stream with empty plastic water bottles and persist in believing that there is a never-ending supply of this essential substance. The calm, knowledgeable voices of the experts — also including the journalist Alex Prud’homme, whose book “The Ripple Effect” is cited as an inspiration in the opening credits — make “Last Call at the Oasis” especially scary. Nothing is more unnerving than predictions of an apocalypse delivered by a reasonable person in friendly, conversational tones.The question is whether anyone is listening, and it is a question that always nips at the heels of documentaries like this one. One way the question is answered — or perhaps finessed — is by the optimistic, encouraging tone that tends to sneak in at the end. Most examples of the “We’re screwed” documentary, in other words (at least in the American version of the genre), end on a note of “Yes, we can.”Some of the optimism in “Last Call at the Oasis” comes from a gratifyingly unlikely place — the Middle East, where shared water problems have led to cooperation amid otherwise intractable political conflict. There is also a measure of hope to be gleaned from Ms. Yu’s interview subjects, though less from what they have to say — which is pretty grim — than from their seriousness and dedication.However frustrated they may be by political paralysis, corporate trickery or plain human stupidity, none of them seem inclined to give up. When they do, we really will be screwed, and we won’t have or need movies like this to tell us so.“Last Call at the Oasis” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

In one, the Armstrong character (Ben Foster) studies himself in a mirror while rehearsing different versions of the statement, “I’ve never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.” No matter how he says it, the words ring false.In the other, set aboard a tour bus, members of his United States Postal Service team, hooked up to blood bags as part of a doping regimen, banter about who should play the Armstrong role in a Hollywood biography. The bus suggests nothing so much as a nursery of grown-up infants.“The Program” is nothing like the Alex Gibney documentary “The Armstrong Lie,” which was begun when Mr. Gibney was in the thrall of his subject’s mystique. After Armstrong’s downfall, the film had to be revised, but a lingering tone of disappointment gives it an emotional resonance lacking in “The Program,” which begins and ends with an attitude of disgust.Although Mr. Foster bears some physical resemblance to Armstrong, the air of imperial invincibility that Armstrong projected so skillfully is missing. No matter how he phrases his denial, Mr. Foster sounds about as convincing a used-car salesman cynically peddling a clunker. Because his voice is higher and lighter than Armstrong’s, his pronouncements evoke a quality political pundits once ascribed to the first President George Bush: the wimp factor.Even when under extreme stress, Armstrong projected an air of embattled nobility. It was not too hard to buy the illusion that he was some kind of superman. His very name evokes a heroic stone-faced warrior beyond the reach of petty criticism.As a smirk plays about the corners of Mr. Foster’s mouth, his sneaky, fish-eyed performance suggests he is the director’s designated hit man. Anyone might think twice before buying a used car from this man or even shaking his hand to seal a transaction.The screenplay, by John Hodge (“Trainspotting”), is based on “Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong,” a book by David Walsh, a sportswriter for The Sunday Times of London. Mr. Walsh (Chris O’Dowd) is the patient Javert to Armstrong’s wily Jean Valjean in a 13-year-long quest to expose the hero’s secret.“The Program,” much to its detriment, concentrates almost exclusively on the history of the doping effort . There is no mention of his childhood or adolescence or any attempt to analyze his character. When the movie touches on the Livestrong Foundation, Armstrong’s charitable support organization for those with cancer, it is portrayed as a cynical buffer against allegations of drug use. The movie strongly suggests that the testicular cancer for which Armstrong was treated in the 1990s, before his ascent, was brought on by performance-enhancing drugs.As Armstrong learns about the miraculous effects of the blood booster EPO, he wants some for himself and his teammates. And when he consults with Michele Ferrari, the Italian doctor, cycling coach and champion of EPO (played with a farcical edge by Guillaume Canet), what the movie dubs the most sophisticated doping scandal in sports history shifts into high gear.The movie is sporadically energized by its racing sequences. But it shies away from glamorizing Armstrong’s accomplishments. He is portrayed as a soulless, hypercompetitive narcissist addicted to the spotlight who grows to believe his own hype and is mercilessly vindictive toward anyone who threatens him. It is a measure of the public’s desperate desire for heroes and the greed and duplicity in sports that the scam continued for as long as it did.“The Program” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language.

Tati was a music-hall mime before turning to film directing, and it is the dusty stage world of magic and dancing girls that this film recalls with a delicate visual style, tender humor and a sense of loss. Set in the late 1950s, the story opens on an unnamed French magician who is struggling to keep audiences interested in his old-fashioned sleights of hand. The bouquet tucked up his sleeve has become a gift that nobody seems to want.The illusionist’s lonely gloom brightens when, while performing in a pub in an isolated Scottish village, he finds an appreciative audience of one in the form of a teenager, Alice. The two shyly hit it off despite their different languages, communicating with gestures and few words. The illusionist murmurs an occasional “non,” while Alice speaks in sporadic bleats, a minimalism that recalls how Tati used fragments of dialogue more for their noise than for their meaning. To watch — and listen — to his films and “The Illusionist” is to be reminded of how much useless jabbering there is in movies. (The illusionist’s few words are voiced by Jean-Claude Donda, while Alice’s are supplied by Eilidh Rankin.)Despite the absence of dialogue, a story nevertheless emerges, clearly if not loudly, in the relationship that develops between the two characters. The illusionist has come to the dramatically, moodily hued island village, at the invitation of an enthusiastic admirer, a Scot with a deep thirst and a flirty kilt.  One day the illusionist notices Alice’s shabby shoes (she works in the pub swabbing floors and washing clothes) and buys her a pair of bright red Mary Janes. This kindness leads to a friendship that only deepens after she follows him off the island and all the way to Edinburgh, where they move into a boardinghouse  that’s literally jumping with acrobats and reverberant with the loud miseries of a suicidal clown.Created with both hand-drawn and computer-generated animation, “The Illusionist” is more constrained, visually and narratively, than Mr. Chomet’s last (and first) feature film, the raucous, trippy “Triplets of Belleville.” Many of the new film’s pleasures are reassuring, its nostalgic show world of shabby theaters and rented rooms brought warmly to life with near-tactile detail, from the inviting curve of the rabbit’s belly to the swaying pink feathers on a dancer’s headdress. Mr. Chomet’s muted palette is beautiful, and his love for the 1961 Disney classic “101 Dalmatians” is evident in his gently exaggerated character designs (the father in “Dalmatians” and the illusionist have noble honkers), though he fills in his backgrounds, forgoing the strong,  sketchlike lines that help give “Dalmatians” its modernist look.The relationship between Alice and her protector is thin by comparison and grows increasingly coy. Though she looks like a child when they meet, Alice isn’t the little girl her wardrobe initially suggests. And when they move in together, the illusionist quickly assures her (or the audience) that she can have the bedroom while he takes the sofa. As her taste in pretty things grows, and her Mary Janes are replaced by heels, the two are pulled in separate directions, partly because he has to work harder to support her tastes. This separation allows Mr. Chomet to dodge any Lolita-like complications, yet it also means that the bond remains more vaporously sentimental than deeply felt. The illusionist — whether he’s pulling a string of lights from his mouth or selling brassieres in shop windows — is the film’s true charm.As a footnote, after I saw “The Illusionist” I learned that it has been sharply criticized by Tati’s grandson, Richard Tatischeff Schiel McDonald, who claims  that the story was inspired by Tati’s guilt over abandoning his daughter Helga Marie-Jeanne, Mr. McDonald’s mother. His complaints have been circulated in the British news media, and in May Roger Ebert posted a long letter in which Mr. McDonald calls “The Illusionist” a “grotesque eclectic nostalgic homage to its author.” His pain is palpable. But to see “The Illusionist” exclusively as a Jacques Tati film — to read it only through his biography or, as regrettably, to see it, hoping for a new Tati — is to disregard the actual extant film. Mr. Chomet, as evident from “The Triplets of Belleville,” is not Tati (no one else is), but rather his own artist.“The Illusionist” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Smoking and drinking, and a near suicide.THE ILLUSIONISTOpens on Saturday  in New York and Los Angeles.Directed and edited by Sylvain Chomet; adapted by Mr. Chomet from an original screenplay by Jacques Tati; music by Mr. Chomet; art director, Bjarne Hansen; produced by Bob Last and Sally Chomet; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

Now they batten/On the cornucopia/Of her body.” In “Amy,” a shattering biographical portrait of the British singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, you catch sight of some other hyenas every time the paparazzi go in for the kill. The photographers shove their cameras toward her haunted face and ravaged body, ripping at her with each new shot. Some of those images show up in “Amy,” which traces the arc of her short, messy life from smoky-voiced jazz singer to global pop sensation to her death in 2011, at 27, from alcohol poisoning. This material makes for uneasy viewing, as do some of her agonizing self-portraits. The director, Asif Kapadia, doesn’t directly answer whether the public wanted to see Ms. Winehouse hit bottom or were instead force-fed her downfall, though this question haunts the movie. Because whatever the case, it became difficult to avoid the steady feed of her later-life degradation, photo by photo, joke by joke. What’s startling now is to realize that we were all watching her die.We still are, though there’s a great deal more to this documentary than sad spectacle. The larger outline of Ms. Winehouse’s story is more or less well known, having been previously packaged and sold through public relations and the entertainment media, those mutually dependent engines of contemporary celebrity culture. Mr. Kapadia opens that story when Ms. Winehouse is around 14 and goofing around on video in a house with some pals, including her lifelong friends, Juliette Ashby and Lauren Gilbert. They were girls from suburban northwest London, and come across as ordinary teenagers until Amy opens the throttle on “Happy Birthday,” the words pouring out in a low, rich quaver. The voice is already there.By 16, Ms. Winehouse had a manager, Nick Shymansky, who was 19 when they joined forces. Their professional relationship turned into a deep, enduring friendship, a bond that benefits this movie enormously. Ms. Winehouse’s label, Universal Music UK, commissioned the movie and gave Mr. Kapadia full creative control, one reason that it’s spikier, tougher and more interesting than the usual official biographies-hagiographies. Universal also provided Mr. Kapadia complete access to her musical catalog, which allows you to track her through her music and not only through the testimonials of her family, friends and colleagues. Equally important, Mr. Shymansky, Ms. Ashby and Ms. Gilbert all cooperated with Mr. Kapadia, sharing their Amy through their archives as well as joyous and chokingly emotional remembrances. Mr. Kapadia keeps his eyes — and yours — on Ms. Winehouse throughout. Shrewdly, he has pieced together the visuals exclusively from archival images, tapping into a trove of home videos, concert material, publicity interviews and recording sessions. (Among the highlights is a piercingly moving session with a gentle, supportive Tony Bennett.) Like many who have come of age in the digital era, Ms. Winehouse and her friends seemed to have kept a running record of their lives, cataloging their waking and sleeping hours, their back-seat and backstage lulls; Mr. Shymansky alone gave Mr. Kapadia 12 hours of video. All this personal documentation, as well as Mr. Kapadia’s decision not to incorporate any new on-camera interviews, sometimes gives the movie the feel of a diary. This makes “Amy” an intensely intimate experience, which is delightful as you’re getting to know her early on, when she’s all shy, charming smiles and having her first successes. In its rise-and-fall arc, her star-is-born/star-is-dead story is painfully familiar; she is, bluntly, just one more name now etched on our pop-cultural mausoleum. Yet, as this movie reminds you again and again, the commercial entity known as Amy Winehouse was also a human being, and it’s this person, this Amy, whom you get to know through all the lovely little details, knowing winks, funny asides and barbed observations that help make the movie memorable. Ms. Winehouse was surprisingly funny, down home, sharp and seemingly self-knowing, as suggested by her voiced fears about becoming famous.Fame hit her fast, hard and mercilessly. Mr. Kapadia shows the expected good highs, including relationships with other musicians, like Yasiin Bey when he was known as Mos Def. There are the inevitable bad highs, too, including those that helped destroy her health and transform her into tabloid fodder. It’s awful to see, and at times infuriating, as when Jay Leno, who had welcomed her onto “The Tonight Show,” makes jokes about her drug use with repulsive callousness. And while she sometimes tried to dodge the public, she seemed incapable of escaping it — us — whether by choice or not. The documentary becomes progressively more difficult to watch as Ms. Winehouse falls apart and as its intimacy, which earlier felt nice and cozily warm, starts to feel uncomfortably intrusive.This discomfort is crucial to the movie’s complexity and is why it works as somewhat of an ethical and intellectual provocation. With “Amy,” Mr. Kapadia isn’t simply revisiting Ms. Winehouse’s life and death, but also — by pulling you in close to her, first pleasantly and then unpleasantly — telling the story of contemporary celebrity and, crucially, fandom’s cost. She obviously enjoyed some of what fame gave her, but it also delivered swarms of paparazzi and made for a few unhealthy relationships. Ms. Winehouse’s family has complained that the movie is “misleading and contains some basic untruths.” Mr. Kapadia, however, doesn’t seem to have needed to work hard to make some members of Ms. Winehouse’s circle look bad; they do a fine job of that themselves. The rest of us don’t come out looking terribly good, either. Did you laugh, as I did, when you first heard Ms. Winehouse singing “Rehab,” which opens with the lyric “They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ‘No, no, no’ ”? It’s a catchy song and made her a mint, but I’ll never hear it the same way again after seeing this documentary, mostly because, scene by scene, Mr. Kapadia makes a case for just how desperately unfunny it always was. At times in “Amy,” it seems as if Ms. Winehouse, by living and crashing so publicly, was intent on making the whole world her enabler, even if it’s clear she wasn’t the only addict here. Somebody, after all, buys those tabloids.“Amy” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme drug and alcohol use.",1,7851076.0,100000.0,1

Way Beyond.,"A pretty young actress. A casting call. A private meeting with the lecherous man who has the power to give her the role. “Starry Eyes” tries to wring a horror movie out of this tired old setup but, halfway in, seems to realize it has nothing new to offer and becomes a mere gorefest.Alexandra Essoe plays the actress, Sarah, who is frustrated by her inability to break into the business and prone to hair-pulling fits even before she goes on the fateful casting call. She makes the decision that actresses in this story line always seem to make, only to find that in succumbing to the lecher she has also sold her soul.So far so good, but then Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer, who jointly wrote and directed, appear to run out of ideas, sending Sarah on a writhing, sputtering killing spree through her circle of friends and roommates that isn’t particularly scary, just gross. Ms. Essoe does pretty well with what she’s given. It would be nice to see her in a more substantive movie.Maybe the filmmakers think they’re saying something about prostituting oneself, in one way or another, in pursuit of the hollow goal of stardom. If so, the idea is hardly original. There are hints of satire beneath the goings-on, but if that was the intent, it’s too veiled.",0,,,0

SCOTT,"Cocky, Aggressive and Into Gangs: Meet Tokyo’s Streetwise Toughs","“Tokyo Waka,” a new documentary by John Haptas and Kristine Samuelson, describes itself as a “city poem,” which is certainly accurate. The film is a short, nimble consideration of the collision between the wildness of nature and the orderly bustle of modern urban life. It is also an essay on ornithology, Japanese culture and the challenges of pest control.Not that the crows that are the film’s subject — its heroes, villains and extras — are pests, exactly. They are too noble, too beautiful, to be dismissed in that way. But the 20,000 black birds that cloud the skies and perch on the power lines of Tokyo certainly cause their share of problems. They tear open garbage bags with their beaks, snatch carp from decorative ponds and attack unsuspecting pedestrians who move too close to their nests.Some of those are intricate structures made from discarded clothes hangers. Crows, whose brains are more than twice the size of those of ducks, are intelligent and resourceful creatures. They use their beaks to shape twigs into hooks that they use to fish grubs out of holes in trees. They communicate with one another through sound and movement and respond to the presence of humans in complicated ways. Mr. Haptas and Ms. Samuelson record their behavior and survey artists, priests, biologists and nonexpert Tokyo residents who share anecdotes, folklore and scientific data on the birds. “Tokyo Waka,” a fleet 63 minutes long, is being shown with another documentary about an equally mysterious though somewhat more familiar animal. “CatCam,” directed by Seth Keal, is a short tribute to a viral-video star who is also, perhaps, an auteur. Mr. Lee, a domestic cat in South Carolina, had a camera fitted to his collar by his owners. The images he collects offer fleeting glimpses of his enigmatic social life and serendipitous compositions of light, shadow and movement.“CatCam” is no more a cat’s-eye view of life than “Tokyo Waka” is a rendering of the world from a bird’s eye, but, together, they remind us that the human-animal relationship is a two-way street. In the cases of crows and cats, however, there is an intriguing asymmetry. We regard them with a fascination that sometimes mutates into affection, sometimes into superstition and fear. But it’s not clear that our curiosity is reciprocated.",0,,,1

He brings with him a fearsome if indistinctly defined reputation, but he is determined to hang up his firearms.His father is a minister, the Rev. William Clayton, played by Mr. Sutherland’s real-life father, Donald Sutherland. That should have been a recipe for something memorable, but only one scene between the Sutherlands really crackles, when John Henry relates the traumatic incident that left him averse to gun violence.The rest of the movie (Jon Cassar directed a script by Brad Mirman) is a plodding good guy, bad guy story devoid of nuance or surprise. John Henry finds that the town is being upended by a tyrannical capitalist determined to force residents off their land so he can bring a railroad through. A half-dozen thugs help with the strong-arming.Why don’t these timid townspeople, all of whom own rifles, just band together and defy the ruffians? Because then the movie would have even less plot than it actually does. Will John Henry, after remaining passive in the face of all sorts of abuse, finally take up the gun again and administer justice?

But the job is taking all of her time, and she begins to contemplate retiring to explore other interests, like writing. She also wouldn’t mind having a love life, something she has been missing since a divorce years earlier.There’s nothing particularly flashy about the tale, and it has its share of moments when viewers might well be asking, “Why exactly was this a worthy subject for a documentary?” Peter Wiedensmith, the director, also lets the proceedings veer toward hagiography on occasion without ever taking the time to show the appeal of Ms. Sewell’s ministerial approach.

832,2011-10-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,MANOHLA DARGIS,"For a Bourgeois Frenchman, Happiness Is a Garret Away","Lighter than a meringue and as insubstantial, the French boulevard comedy “The Women on the 6th Floor” was designed for the gentle laughter it easily earns. Set in 1962 Paris, the story involves a seemingly hopeless, staid bourgeois businessman whose entire existence — family, career, sense of purpose and patrimony — is overturned after he discovers another, happier world with a group of Spanish maids living in his family’s building. As in Henri Murger’s classic “Scènes de la Vie de Bohème” (and in the Puccini opera), redemption is just a garret away.At first glance, Jean-Louis Joubert (a great Fabrice Luchini) seems too embedded in his routine to kick-start a story, much less his life. He and his chilly wife, Suzanne (Sandrine Kiberlain), live in a cavernous apartment in the huge building where he, his parents and grandparents were all born, and where his recently, not altogether dearly departed mother reigned supreme. (The couple’s two young sons are at boarding school, if not for long.)When the film opens, Suzanne is trying to redo the apartment to her taste, against the vigorous protests of the family’s longtime maid, Germaine (Michèle Gleizer). For Germaine any change is an affront to the mother’s memory, though Suzanne claims she only wants a maison of her own.Germaine splits or is fired, it’s hard to say, and Suzanne hires a replacement, María (Natalia Verbeke). She’s a pretty young Spaniard, newly arrived, whose Aunt Concepción (Carmen Maura) lives in one of the tiny rooms rented by some Spanish maids on the top floor of the Jouberts’ building. The director Philippe Le Guay lays out these pieces — Jean-Louis’s gentility, Suzanne’s hauteur, María’s beauty and Suzanne’s decision to bring this beauty home — into place effortlessly, shamelessly, and then swerves. Instead of simply falling for María, Jean-Louis becomes smitten with all the maids, along with their culture, food and friendship. A little paella and acts of kindness later, and he’s nestled in their arms and maternal bosoms.Make that earthy, real, often well-padded bosoms, and you begin to understand how heavily — and dubiously — Mr. Le Guay, who wrote the script with Jérôme Tonnerre, stacks the narrative deck. With fearless or unconscious disregard for clichés about the putative exoticism of other cultures, Mr. Le Guay sets Jean-Louis on an apparently indefensible course: The rich French businessman abandons his cosseted life and finds himself amid the struggling, smiling Spanish domestics. It sounds like the sort of class fantasy that might land the film in Marxist jail if it weren’t so drolly absurd, and if Jean-Louis didn’t seem a bit mad, perhaps, as the film suggests, from all the years he has spent maintaining his respectable bourgeois pose. Certainly poor Suzanne confesses to being exhausted, even with the pampering.Despite Ms. Kiberlain’s sympathetic performance, Suzanne isn’t treated with the generosity she deserves by the filmmakers, who, almost predictably, make her a sexist caricature: the frivolous, wealthy, sexually withholding woman who of course compares badly with her hard-scrubbing, sensual maid. Ms. Verbeke is pretty and appealing, but, somewhat tellingly, María is by comparison a blur. More charitably, Jean-Louis comes across as a child of circumstance who became a man of property and then its prisoner and then something else altogether. He should have been insufferable and, intentionally or not, he’s not entirely likable and even little creepy, which makes him more interesting. Mr. Luchini, with his caught-in-the-headlights stare and a toothy smile that seems welcoming and worried, ensures that he’s irresistible.Though it unfolds in a recognizable if somewhat antiqued Paris, “The Women on the 6th Floor” more truly takes place in movieland. Despite the peeling walls in the maids’ quarters and a few other unpleasantnesses, the film is grounded in fantasy, life’s harsher truths having been gently rounded off. On María’s first day at the Jouberts’, she doesn’t break into a sweat; rather, she and the other Spanish maids, who have come to help, shimmy and shake around like Disney’s Snow White, whistling or really just cha-cha-cha-ing while they work. Repeatedly Mr. Le Guay, who makes expressive use of his actors’ exaggerated vocal and gestural performances, seems to teeter on the verge of a full-blown musical — he almost gets there.THE WOMEN ON THE 6TH FLOOROpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Philippe Le Guay; written by Mr. Le Guay and Jérôme Tonnerre; director of photography, Jean-Claude Larrieu; edited by Monica Coleman; music by Jorge Arriagada; set design by Pierre-François Limbosch; costumes by Christian Gasc; produced by Philippe Rousselet and Étienne Comar; released by Strand Releasing.

It doesn’t really succeed in conveying McQueen’s great passion for auto racing. In truth, it mostly makes him seem like a jerk — but cinephiles might enjoy it as a case study of moviemaking gone wrong.McQueen was at the height of his considerable stardom in 1970 when he tried to make a scripted movie centered on the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the sports car race in France. “The Man & Le Mans,” directed by Gabriel Clarke and John McKenna, focuses on that project, using interviews with people who saw it take shape (including Chad McQueen, McQueen’s son) and audio recordings of McQueen, who died in 1980.That shoot dragged on and on, hampered by the lack of a script, McQueen apparently having one particular vision that an assortment of writers were unable to capture. One who tried was Alan Trustman, who had writing credits on two previous McQueen hits (“Bullitt” and “The Thomas Crown Affair”) and who tells a painful story about a meeting with the star to discuss their clashing views for the racing film.“I was the highest-paid screenwriter in town when I went to that meeting,” Mr. Trustman says, “and after that meeting, the phone never rang again.”The movie that was finally made, “Le Mans,” which came out in 1971, was more documentary than story. (“Dramatically, the picture is a bore,” Howard Thompson wrote in The New York Times.) “The Man & Le Mans” may not generate the sympathy for McQueen that it’s aiming for, but it’s certainly a cautionary tale about Hollywood and the swelled-head syndrome.",0,,,0

Mr. Dern is fine in his crotchety-old-man mode, but the rest of the acting is labored, and the story is an unfocused mishmash that includes a not-very-scandalous family secret, the coming of electrification, an old bank robbery and more.The most interesting thing about the movie is its origin story. Mr. Craven, a professor at Marlboro College in Vermont, turned the low-budget film into a sort of class project: The professional crew was augmented by more than 30 students from 11 colleges, earning academic credit.

A North Korean spy left out in the cold must negotiate threats posed by friend and foe alike, as a bone-crunching story of survival emerges, almost too late, out of the fog of intrigue.An arms deal gone sour lifts the lid on a rat’s nest of spies (the Koreas, Mossad, the C.I.A.) conducting the sort of proxy fight more familiar from the cold war. Mr. Ryoo presents agents from either side of the border with whom we might sympathize. Jong-seong (Ha Jung-woo) is the dedicated North Korean infiltrator whose appearance on the scene causes considerable consternation, as a South Korean intelligence chief, Jin-Soo (Han Suk-kyu), tries to interpret the mess.Mr. Ryoo risks bogging the film down in the lengthy and confounding ramping up. But as soon as “The Berlin File” takes flight with its exhilarating action set pieces, memories of any muddles evaporate amid the tension and vivid engagement with settings, from courtyards to fields. Special mention goes to Jong-seong’s whip-smart countryman, an investigative agent portrayed with electrifying viciousness by Ryoo Seung-bum (the director’s brother).“The Berlin File” boasts one immortal line of dialogue expressing the hubris of a warrior in the shadows: “I’ll die when I feel like it.” But Mr. Ryoo (the director) ends his movie in a hardheaded way that shows that freedom from fear is not always an option.",0,,,0

Tough call. Depends, really, on how you feel about a blood bath set in a school, a teacher beating a zombified student to death and name actors romping through the groves of gross-out humor.Tainted chicken nuggets served at an elementary school turn its students into zombies, and — as if the teacher shortage weren’t already bad enough — a number of educators are quickly eaten. But a handful survive and spend the movie alternately running from the little rotters and trying to kill them.All this mars the first day on the job for Clint, a dorky substitute teacher played by Elijah Wood —  yes, Frodo from “The Lord of the Rings.” And it happens just when he was striking a spark with another teacher, Lucy (Alison Pill of “The Newsroom”), and wondering if he might possibly lure her away from her cloddish boyfriend and fellow teacher, Wade (Rainn Wilson). Jack McBrayer, Nasim Pedrad and Jorge Garcia are among the other familiar adult faces.The role-reversal possibilities inherent in children-prey-on-adults stories can’t really be exploited well when the kids are mere zombies, and in any case there is a lot of horror comedy around lately. So, though “Cooties” has a reasonable amount of laughs and frights, and though real teachers may find it an apt allegory for the zombielike charges in their classrooms, it’s not really funny enough to achieve grown-up cachet, and it’s too ugly and violent for younger viewers.“Cooties” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A school seized by zombies is a very gruesome place.",0,,,0
837,2013-08-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:17,MANOHLA DARGIS,Portrait of the Artist Behind Apple,"It would drive Steve Jobs nuts to know that the new movie about his life has all the sex appeal of a PowerPoint presentation. It isn’t only that Microsoft PowerPoint has become synonymous with the dry, dreary, droning of corporate meetings, it’s also that Microsoft was itself a favorite target of Jobs. (“The only problem with Microsoft,” he said, “is they just have no taste.” Also: “They just make really third-rate products.”) Jobs, who died in 2011 at 56 from complications of pancreatic cancer, thought of himself as an artist, one who, in talking about the design of the Macintosh, said, “Great art stretches the taste, it doesn’t follow tastes.”The historical record is all that’s stretched in “Jobs,” which stars Ashton Kutcher and was directed by Joshua Michael Stern. Compression and omissions are part of any biography. So it’s to be expected that a two-hour movie about one of the most important public figures in recent times leaves out a lot, including famous feuds, forgotten colleagues and even significant business ventures. The point isn’t that there are gaps; the point is what and who have been left out. It’s understandable that a movie that concentrates on Jobs’s earlier years would overlook his involvement with Pixar, which he capitalized in 1986; given the filmmakers’ difficulties dealing with his difficulties it’s also understandable that they slide over a little player called the Xerox Corporation.The story of Jobs visiting Xerox’s Palo Alto research center in 1979 and realizing that the company was, as he put it, “sitting on a gold mine,” is an oft-repeated foundational tale, partly because he appropriated some of Xerox’s ideas. It was during this visit, he later said, that he could see “what the future of computing was destined to be.” In the movie this epiphanic moment seems to occur earlier, during an acid trip. It’s the early 1970s and Steve, who’s dropped out of college, is bumming around, usually barefoot. One day he and two friends, Chrisann Brennan (Ahna O’Reilly) and Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas), go on a lysergically enhanced picnic that culminates with Steve drifting into a field and, as the camera twirls around him and the sun shines upon him, throwing his arms open to the infinite.Before long, Steve has embraced his destiny, hooked up with Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad, delivering a sympathetic, sensitive performance) and is staring into a different immensity: the Apple computer and the technological revolution that it helped bring about. Things move quickly for Steve, who one minute is cobbling together the first Apple in his family’s garage and the next is crunching numbers with an investor, Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney). There are good, bad, happy, sad times, mostly with guys (women barely register), though it all gets heavier after Steve starts driving a Porsche and shacks up in a mansion with only an Einstein poster for company, a trajectory echoed in the soundtrack: “Life’s Been Good,” “Roll With the Changes,” “You Can Do (Whatever).”Written by Matt Whiteley, the movie is bookended by scenes of the middle-aged Jobs, doing what some believed he did best: pitching new products. Fuzzed up and hunched over, Mr. Kutcher looks somewhat like the young Jobs, and there are moments — as when he gives another character a small, devious look as if sliding in a knife — that the casting seems more than a matter of bottom-line calculation. But Mr. Kutcher doesn’t have the tools that some actors use to transcend weak material and either he didn’t receive any help or didn’t allow any real direction from Mr. Stern. Mr. Kutcher’s tendency to cap so many emotional scenes with small, self-satisfied smiles is especially unfortunate because they can’t help but bring to mind his other career as a pitchman for digital cameras.The greater blame rests on the filmmakers, who never find a way to navigate the “passions, perfectionism, demons, desires, artistry, devilry and obsession for control” that Walter Isaacson enumerated in “Steve Jobs,” his 2011 authorized biography. Mr. Stern and Mr. Whiteley pile up Jobs’s multitudes: he screams and smirks, the score rises triumphantly only to ease and darken. Other characters announce to Steve and one another that he’s changed. But how and why? There are nods at his adoption and the daughter he initially refused to acknowledge, but those never amount to much and, after a while, you don’t care. The Great Man theory of history that’s recycled in this movie is inevitably unsatisfying, but never more so when the figure at the center remains as opaque as Jobs does here.“Jobs” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Can He Beat the Koreans?,"The ideal viewer for “Red Dawn,” a slicked-up redo of the 1984 John Milius war flick about a Soviet invasion (with Cuban and Nicaraguan support) of the United States, has to be Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. That’s because by changing the attackers to North Koreans, the filmmakers have paid him a great compliment by making his country a Hollywood villain. Thinking adults will find a North Korean invasion the stuff of wing-nut fantasies, which — with kids who just want to see guys shoot stuff up — is probably what the distributor is banking on. Everyone else interested may want to go with the campy flow, like a colleague who snorted of the invaders, “What, did they paddle over in canoes?”Nah, they parachute in by the digital zillions, by the looks of the jumpers blooming in the sky shortly after the remake opens. The place is Spokane, Wash., where, before the invasion, Friday night lights shine on a high school quarterback, Matt (Josh Peck). Headstrong and independent, Matt blows the game (he isn’t a team player), ignoring sideline directives, but he has a pretty girlfriend, Erica (Isabel Lucas), to comfort him. He also has a dead mom; a supportive father (Brett Cullen); and an older brother to resent, learn from and finally embrace: the pretty, laconic Jed (Chris Hemsworth), who’s on leave from the Marines. Note: Jed is a team player.Boys will be boys until forced to become a band of brothers, and so it is in “Red Dawn,” which, like some other war movies, is a male weepie with guns. The story lurches violently up and forward the morning after Matt’s football loss, with the North Koreans flooding in. As Spokane is painted red with Communist posters and patriot blood, Jed, Matt and some others escape. First, they freak out, and then they rise up. Invoking the examples of the Vietcong, mujahedeen and minutemen (in that order), Jed leads them to lock and load in a song of guerrilla guts and glory. Other parts of the country fall, too, leaving America free only from “Michigan to Montana, Alabama to Arizona.”In his debut the director, Dan Bradley, a stunt coordinator with a long list of credits, handles the low-fi action well, which helps divert attention from the bargain-bin special effects, bad acting and politics. He revs engines and cuts loose bodies, adding energy to a movie that often sags, especially when the floundering youngsters open their mouths. Mr. Hemsworth, from “Thor,” is no Patrick Swayze (the first film’s peewee John Wayne), but he and Josh Hutcherson almost alone escape embarrassment. Not so the credited writers, Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore, and a script that originally featured Chinese invaders. After Chinese complaints, the occupier was changed to North Korea, which makes marginally more sense because China has, of course, already taken over, one sneaker at a time.“Red Dawn” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

In the 1990s, the brothers Rick and Tom Smith amped up a decades-old invention to create their electricity-zapping “home run product.” Since then, their company, Taser International, has defended the Taser’s virtues with on-message verbiage in the face of deaths associated with the weapon.Mr. Berardini primes us to dislike the device by showing a Taser being tested on buffaloes, but the footage of the massive animals crumpling effectively illustrates a macho fantasy of violent control fulfilled by the weapon. The heavily researched documentary features surveillance and dashboard video of people killed by Tasers, and demonstrates the results of the device’s widespread adoption by the police, often without sufficient training. Taser International also has its say through an empty-eyed publicity representative and the Smiths, who argue that the weapon saves lives as an alternative to a gun.Between the contentious talk about Tasers and the queasy video footage of zaps and falls, the movie becomes a dense stew of words and death. The company’s boosterism of the benefits of “neuromuscular incapacitation” for law enforcement and its highly constrained sense of responsibility together suggest something out of “RoboCop.” (Company motto: “Protecting Life. Protecting Truth.”)Mr. Berardini’s packed documentary makes its case early and often, perhaps too often, but it’s more chilling than your average issue film. In the hands of a determined business, a violent invention can be a game-changer that gives rise to tragic losses.",0,,,0

Thompson (novel)",2011,6.2,93290.0,50.0,2017-11-02 04:18:14,A. O. SCOTT,"In San Juan, on the Road to Gonzo","“The Rum Diary,” directed by Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”) and based on an early novel of the same title by Hunter S. Thompson, will appeal to anyone who harbors romantic ideas about liquor, newspaper journalism or that mythical late-Eisenhower, early-Kennedy “Mad Men” time when the ’60s were getting ready to happen. Connoisseurs of straw hats and cool sunglasses will find much to savor, as will aficionados of guilt-free cigarette smoking and midday boozing.A mild lark disguised as a wild bender, “The Rum Diary” is also a touching tribute to Thompson himself, who committed suicide in 2005. Thompson’s alter ego, a young writer named Paul Kemp, is played by Johnny Depp. This makes the new film a prequel of sorts to Terry Gilliam’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” (1998), in which Mr. Depp impersonated Thompson in his full Gonzo glory, with Hawaiian-print shirts draped over his torso and wild hallucinations sprouting from his balding pate.Kemp is, at least at first glance, a more conventional fellow, arriving at his new job at an English-language San Juan daily, in the grip of a serious hangover but otherwise more presentable than some of his colleagues.These include a burly, shaggy photographer named Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli) and a filthy, booze-addled wraith known as Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi). The two of them become Paul’s roommates and co-conspirators in a rambling adventure that pits them, somewhat woozily, against the editor of their newspaper (Richard Jenkins) and a cabal of neocolonialist real estate developers.This is not really “Fear and Loathing in Puerto Rico” but rather the literary equivalent of a superhero origin story, in that it supplies fans with the chronicle of how a more-or-less ordinary guy transformed himself into a beloved archetype. “I haven’t figured out how to write as myself,” Paul says at one point, and as he chafes against the requirements of his job and the foul corruption of his environment, he is also undergoing the testing ordeal that will ultimately give him a voice and a vocation.His nemesis — every superhero needs one — is Hal Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a great white sharpie who seems to possess everything Paul desires. Hal, a flack for the predatory, moneyed interests who want to despoil a pristine island, has a luxurious house on the beach, a sweet red sports car and a sexy fiancée named Chenault (Amber Heard) who seems to have eyes for Paul. Hal also sees Paul as a target for seduction, offering him a vaguely defined but apparently crucial role in his lucrative development scheme. Paul’s journalistic skills and connections (especially if he’s spuriously identified as a correspondent for an important mainland paper) will be an asset.And so Paul’s drunken meanderings lead him to a crossroad, with Hal and Moberg representing opposed, cautionary visions of a plausible future. With his talent and looks, his good breeding and passable manners, Paul could easily sell out and settle into a version of Hal’s cushy, corrupt existence. Or if his taste for alcohol overtakes him — he rates his drinking “at the higher end of social” — he could end up a wasted wreck like his colleague.Instead, of course, he turns into Hunter S. Thompson, an evolution foreshadowed throughout “The Rum Diary” in ways that will delight Thompson devotees. Sala, good-hearted and oddly practical in spite of himself, is a prototype of Dr. Gonzo, the bulky lawyer who would be Sancho to Thompson’s Quixote in “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.” Paul’s comments as he watches Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy debate on television prefigure both the Nixon hatred that would be one of Thompson’s great passions and the mix of prophecy and paranoia that would characterize his political writing. “The Irishman will win,” he predicts. “But they won’t let him live.”In the course of a narrative that both steers toward and swerves away from a beat-the-bad-guys, get-the-girl ending, Kemp locates his ethical center of gravity, recovers his chivalrous instincts and reconciles his appetites with his awakening sense of mission. “What did we take?” he asks, after he and Sala have dosed themselves with a powerful and unnamed hallucinogen. “We’ll need to get some more!” Later he declares, “I put the bastards of the world on notice that I do not have their best interests at heart.” Together those statements might stand as a précis of the vivid and improbable real career that took shape after the fictional events depicted in this film.Which on balance is more a confirmation of existing legends than a revelation. Mr. Depp, drawing in his mouth and lowering the register of his voice, is reliably unpredictable and predictably cool, but as is so often the case lately, he seems to be acting from behind the mask of his own charisma. Ms. Heard does what she can to overcome the essentially decorative nature of her part, while most of the rest of the cast does whatever mugging or ranting seems appropriate. The exception is Mr. Rispoli, whose sweaty, anxious geniality is the most interesting and authentic thing in the movie. The rest is pleasant enough, which may sound more damning than I mean it to, given Thompson’s reputation.“The Rum Diary” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The main setting is the Glade, where a “Greenie,” or newcomer, arrives each month with supplies for a platoon of lost boys. The Glade is surrounded by a giant maze monitored by “Grievers,” monsters that have features of spiders, scorpions and robots. During the day, “Runners” map the maze, but moviegoers may feel as if they were the ones being tested.“The Maze Runner,” adapted from James Dashner’s novel, is a perfectly serviceable entry in the young-adult dystopian sweepstakes. It combines elements of “Lord of the Flies” with the Minotaur and Orpheus myths, but it plays as something closer to “The Hunger Games” experienced through a dissociative fog. Much suspense comes from wondering which favored Hollywood twist the movie will employ. Is this actually the present day? Has someone blown up the planet?Yet by keeping its cards so close, “The Maze Runner” remains compelling. Sent to the Glade for mysterious reasons, a messianic figure, Thomas (Dylan O’Brien), discovers that the changing maze can be used against the Grievers.Whatever cataclysm has ailed society has inspired the cinematographer to bathe everything in bluish gray. The Grievers’ limbs tumble over one another in an indistinct mash of menace. The dime store explanations are unsatisfying, but the movie does its main job: raising curiosity for a sequel.

So when the director, Prachya Pinkaew, and his favorite elbows-of-fury actor, Tony Jaa, were finished with their “Ong Bak” trilogy, they brought the whole gang back in “The Protector 2.” That includes Kham (Mr. Jaa); his friend Mark, the Interpol agent (Mum Jokmok); and Khon, who is kidnapped once more.This time, Khon has been stolen ostensibly for an elephant camp but, it turns out, for a far darker purpose. As Kham hunts for Khon, he gets mixed up with a murder, twin female martial artists who think he did it, and LC, a crime lord who ranks and collects fighters. (LC is played by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan; he portrays a similar character — minus the blind Thai translator — in “Brick Mansions.”) Since Kham combines the best of the Muay Thai discipline with elements of parkour, he is branded No. 1. Literally.With jokes and computer-generated spectacles diluting the action, this is not one for fight-film purists. The movie’s true hero, of course, is Panna Rittikrai, the renowned martial arts choreographer who comes up with many impressive set pieces here, including Kham’s face-off with hordes of motorcycle-riding assassins on the rooftops of Bangkok. Next time, maybe they’ll get Khon up there, too.“The Protector 2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for excessive stylized violence and about every 10th word RZA utters.",0,,,0

GOLD,A Lightning Rod in a Game With Bats,"The Dock of “No No: A Dockumentary” is Dock Ellis, the Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher who famously claimed he had thrown his 1970 no-hitter against the San Diego Padres while on LSD. In recounting Ellis’s career, the director, Jeffrey Radice, deftly crosscuts interviews with Ellis, who died in 2008, with those of teammates, friends and former wives, to depict an occasionally volatile athlete who was more thoughtful than many assumed and who became a dedicated addiction counselor.  Placing Ellis in context, “No No” recalls how, in the late 1960s and ’70s, baseball increasingly reflected larger societal influences. Even on a team with standouts like Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell, Ellis — a rotation mainstay when Pittsburgh won the 1971 World Series — was a lightning rod, a self-described “angry black man.” (Jackie Robinson wrote to him in support of his outspokenness.) Traded to the Yankees, he helped pitch that team into the 1976 World Series. Introspective, with eclectic interests, he counted among his friends the poet Donald Hall and the director Ron Howard.As to whether Ellis truly pitched while tripping, the film offers little skepticism. Ellis mentioned it years after he was out of baseball; several sportswriters cried foul, but their doubts aren’t examined here. To Ellis, who tells his story convincingly, using acid was no great leap: “I pitched every game in the major leagues under the influence of drugs.”Whatever. As this smart and sympathetic profile shows, Dock Ellis didn’t need a no-hitter, stoned or otherwise, to define himself; he was his own best work.",1,,,0

The scene is London, last March: A small cluster of paparazzi is egging Mr. Bieber on, and he takes the bait, jumping at the photographers and being held back by a bodyguard. At least half of the conversation (on both sides) is bleeped.“I happened to snap,” Mr. Bieber says of the incident and his confrontation with one participant. “I wanted to hit him.”Depending on how you get your news about Mr. Bieber, this is either a sanitized version of very public events or a jolt of reality intruding into Mr. Bieber’s unsullied dreamboat narrative.That scene alone doesn’t save this film from being another piece of propaganda for the Bieber proletariat, but it is, at the very least, an acknowledgment that the days of pure fluff are over. Going forward, understanding Mr. Bieber — at 19, already a veteran pop star — requires seeing him as both an idol and a target, a child and a man.That said, films like this work best when exalting is the task, and when it comes to displaying Mr. Bieber in his milieu — onstage — it shines. The footage is arresting and crisp, and Mr. Bieber is in his element: He’s not the most outgoing pop star, but he has the requisite attitude, and his mild cool comes through clearly.But that is the bulk of what “Believe” has to say about its subject. We see far more of Mr. Bieber onstage than in an interview chair, and the interview is conducted by Jon M. Chu, the film’s director, who keeps the conversation light, apart from noting to Mr. Bieber that he is “the perfect candidate to become a train wreck,” a suggestion that is quickly parried.“Believe” lacks the genuine emotional swells of 2011’s “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,” except for one section in which Mr. Bieber talks about Avalanna Routh, a fan who had had a rare form of cancer since she was 18 months old and who died last year at the age of 6. “I miss her, Bro,” he says, tears falling down his cheeks.Fans in the theater at the screening I caught — the film was not screened for critics — were crying here, too. And, in the movie, it’s fans who do most of the emotional heavy lifting, as seen in home videos and earnest YouTube clips, and in the crowd at his show, screaming unreservedly. One scene is filmed from inside his car, a swarm of girls flooding every window; it’s intense and frightening.On Christmas Eve, the day before the film’s release, Mr. Bieber took to Twitter with a message: “My beloved beliebers I’m officially retiring.” (Anyone want to bet on that? Even Mr. Bieber appeared to back off a little bit later.) At best, it was a cynical ploy to gin up interest in the film. At worst, it was a cry for help.If it’s that, then the secondary interviews with Mr. Bieber’s intimates, all of which have just a touch of black cloud hovering overhead, are extra resonant. Scooter Braun, Mr. Bieber’s manager, describes this star’s journey as “a constant search for validation.” Usher speaks of Mr. Bieber’s fans as his “moral compass.” And the producer Rodney Jerkins, while praising Mr. Bieber’s abilities, acknowledges that he has experienced only victory thus far: “He doesn’t really understand what the loss looks like.” But he’s starting to — imagine what that movie would look like, if anyone were brave enough to make it.“Justin Bieber’s Believe” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested.)

Directed by Matthew Vaughn, “X-Men: First Class” reaches back to the early 1960s for an origin story of mutants, mad men and mods that takes some of its cues from James Bond and more than a few costumes from Austin Powers. Like “Mad Men,” this new “X-Men” indulges in period nostalgia as it gazes into the future, using the backdrop of the cold war (and its turtlenecks) to explore how the past informs the present (while also blowing stuff up).Like the first “X-Men,” this one opens in the 1940s in a Nazi concentration camp, where a young Erik Lehnsherr tries to destroy a metal gate that’s separated him from his parents with what appears to be the power of his mind and his anguish. It’s a futile endeavor, but one that attracts the attention of a tea-sipping sadist first called Dr. Schmidt and later Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, enjoying himself), whose venality earns Erik’s wrath. His anger and Shaw’s evil drive a story that leaps from World War II to the cold war when, as the United States and the Soviet Union play a rigged game of chicken, the adult Erik (Michael Fassbender) will brood across a chessboard at a future nemesis, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy).“First Class” relates how these dreamboats became the antagonists who were played by Ian McKellen (a k a Magneto) and Patrick Stewart (Professor X) in the first films and, with the rest of the characters, were eventually swamped by ever noisier special effects. Written by Mr. Vaughn with a clutch of others, the new movie is lighter in tone and look than its predecessors, and appreciably less self-serious than those directed by Bryan Singer. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it also feels less personal, though Mr. Vaughn gets satisfying performances and copious tears, along with sex appeal, from his leading men. Mr. Vaughn doesn’t bring conviction to the story’s identity politics (say it loud, I’m mutant and I’m proud), but he gives Mr. Fassbender and Mr. McAvoy room to bring the brotherly love.After parallel introductions of the young Erik and the young Charles (in Westchester County, where Charles is joined by Raven/Mystique, played as a teenager by Jennifer Lawrence), the scene shifts to 1962. A few cranks of the plot later, and assorted fiery and smoking-hot mutants with handles like Angel (Zoe Kravitz) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) are soon walking on and flying over a world stage alongside Soviet generals, American men in black and Shaw, now fortified with superpowers and a cool number, Emma Frost (January Jones, sullen, bosomy). Mr. Vaughn, whose last movie was the modestly scaled “Kick-Ass,” keeps the mutants, locales and narrative elements from blurring together and sometimes gives the proceedings a nice jolt, as in a forcible tooth extraction seen from inside a gaping mouth.The defining virtue of the first X-Men movies was the seriousness that Mr. Singer brought to this saga of mutants uneasily sharing fates and plotlines with humans. His signature unsmiling approach at times tipped into overkill, like cement shoes on a drowning bunny. Yet his moody lighting and characters also worked as a countervailing force to the camp that has often clung to comic-book movies ever since George Clooney ran amok in a Bat codpiece. Movies like the original “X-Men” turned the ethos that shaped what’s been called the Dark Age of comic books into blockbuster gold (“Spider-Man” and the rebooted “Batman” shortly followed) and fed harder-edged small flicks like “Kick-Ass” and “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” which push and pull between comic-book super-parody and super-solemnity.“X-Men: First Class” is plenty serious, mostly in its ambitions for world box office domination. With its spy-on-spy globetrotting, old-fashioned villains (we’re back in the U.S.S.R. for a few scenes), flirty but prematurely swinging minis and fan-boy bits (look for an eye-blink-fast tribute to “Basic Instinct” and a cameo from the cult actor Michael Ironside), the whole enterprise has an agreeable lightness, no small thing, given its rapidly moving parts. The weighty themes — post-Holocaust defiance and post-Stonewall pride — are still in play but less laboriously. “Never again,” vows Erik, raising the freak flag. It’s a gesture that the “X-Men” faithful, already schooled in the rights of man and mutant, can dutifully nod at while they and everyone else groove to the sounds of “Green Onions” and the sight of the former Mrs. Don Draper on ice.X-MEN: FIRST CLASSOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Matthew Vaughn; written by Mr. Vaughn, Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Jane Goldman, based on a story by Sheldon Turner and Bryan Singer and the Marvel Comics series by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby; director of photography, John Mathieson; edited by Lee Smith and Eddie Hamilton; music by Henry Jackman; production design by Chris Seagers; costumes by Sammy Sheldon; produced by Lauren Shuler Donner, Simon Kinberg, Gregory Goodman and Mr. Singer; released by 20th Century Fox.

SCOTT,"An Evangelist, an Atheist and an Act That Tests Faith","The American culture war, that combustible, stupefying cocktail of religion, sex, politics and everything else that gets people hot and bothered, represents a rich vein of satiric and dramatic potential. George Ratliff’s “Salvation Boulevard,” adapted from a novel by Larry Beinhart (“Wag the Dog”), suggests that it may sometimes be too rich. The movie, set in and around a Sun Belt megachurch with a charismatic pastor, is a console full of jammed and disconnected hot buttons.The exceptional cast does what it can to keep things jumping and grounded, as the tone wobbles from intrigue to farce and back. Pierce Brosnan, as Pastor Dan, who is trying to leverage his spiritual juice into lucrative real estate, has a hearty, sly allure that steers almost entirely clear of caricature. And the best thing about “Salvation Boulevard” is its avoidance of condescending stereotypes. Mr. Ratliff, whose earlier films include the documentary “Hell House,” is happy to let his fish swim free of their barrel.Pastor Dan’s stooge and foil is Carl (Greg Kinnear), a former Deadhead who seems to have stumbled into faith and a marriage to Gwen (Jennifer Connelly), a high-strung believer with a skeptical teenage daughter and a dogmatic dad. The accidental shooting of an outspoken atheist professor (Ed Harris) puts Carl at odds with his church and his family, and in mortal danger from an especially literal-minded member of the congregation (Jim Gaffigan).It all lurches around in a good-natured way, allowing you to savor Mr. Kinnear’s deadpan, Ms. Connelly’s anti-deadpan and Marisa Tomei’s delightful randomness. (She plays a security guard who reminds Carl of his earlier worship in the church of Jerry Garcia.) As the plot swerves toward an almost crazy conclusion, there is the inkling of a strong, interesting idea here, about how some versions of modern religion are predicated on the systematic denial of reality, but “Salvation Boulevard” is itself too loosely tethered to the actual world to make the point with the necessary vigor or acuity.",0,27445.0,,1

Its anticipation, however, is a unifying thread, an aspirational undercurrent to the families’ quotidian struggles. Money is tight, and jobs are precarious; and as the movie slowly accumulates worries over house payments and health care, the $10,000 prize becomes a life-changing brass ring.Parking his camera in church and truck stops, at family dinners and the gym, Mr. Bentgen is an impassive onlooker who offers no voice-over and only a minimum of on-screen information. Shooting wide and high, he assembles a collage of contrasts: chilly exteriors and warm, bustling interiors; financial fragility and money-no-object generosity; physical degeneration and emotional sturdiness.Seemingly oblivious to scrutiny, his subjects interact with an easy naturalism as commonplace events (the birth of a baby; the death of a deer) unfold in movie-long arcs. Yet there’s a stillness to the filmmaking, coupled with Saunder Jurriaans and Danny Bensi’s truly lovely original score, that lends specific shots — toddlers bundled up like pastel Ewoks on a snowdrift, or a bakery window glowing like a still life in a gallery — a near-heartbreaking melancholy. “Northern Light” contains more than one competition, but what it’s really about is the difference between trying to win and trying not to lose.",1,,,0

And excellent concert footage. But before viewers learn this venerable ensemble’s story, much less see its members rock out on screen, they are subjected to Mr. Crowe’s voice-over account of his own early discovery of the Seattle scene.Mr. Crowe, the director of “Jerry Maguire” and the ill-fated “Vanilla Sky” and “Elizabethtown,” has probably never met a musician (or movie star) he didn’t like. In “Almost Famous,” Mr. Crowe’s autobiographical film about being a Rolling Stone reporter in the 1970s, the music critic Lester Bangs (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman), a mentor of sorts to the young protagonist, is rendered, accurately, as a writer of animated, penetrating and incisive prose — a sharp contrast to Mr. Crowe’s soft features and star-struck interviews. If “Pearl Jam Twenty” is any indication, his example went unheeded.Which is not to say that the film is devoid of information. The band had roots in the Seattle group Mother Love Bone, whose frontman, Andrew Wood, died of a heroin overdose in 1990. The rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard and the bassist Jeff Ament, after a long mourning, recruited the lead guitarist Mike McCready before discovering Eddie Vedder, a charismatic singer whose deep, resonant voice seems ageless. (The current drummer, Matt Cameron, joined in 1998.)Pearl Jam went on to surpass its 1990s contemporaries like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Nirvana, even as it transcended the label grunge. Its flinty independence and brawny, expansive sound, in songs like “Jeremy” and “World Wide Suicide,” have remained intact, and the group consistently fills arenas without Top 40 hits, commanding a fan devotion enjoyed by the likes of, say, Phish.Mr. Crowe dutifully covers well-known points in the band’s history, like Mr. Vedder’s early feud with Kurt Cobain; group members’ appearance before a Congressional subcommittee as they protested Ticketmaster service charges; and the death of nine fans in a crowd crush at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark in 2000.But there are scant glimpses of spouses or families, and barely a mention of Mr. McCready’s struggle with Crohn’s disease. The passing of creative authority from Mr. Gossard and Mr. Ament to Mr. Vedder is blithely treated as an overnight, finger-snap transition, a dubious depiction at best. Michael Rapaport’s recent documentary, “Beats, Rhymes & Life,” about the hip-hop ensemble A Tribe Called Quest, offers far more intergroup drama.Fortunately, “Pearl Jam Twenty” does deliver plenty of concert sequences, well recorded and capturing the majesty of this phenomenal live act, as well as some of Mr. Vedder’s jaw-dropping, free-fall stage dives. While the movie may not have the insight of D. A. Pennebaker’s “Don’t Look Back” or even Phil Joanou’s U2 travelogue, “Rattle and Hum,” Pearl Jam devotees will not go home musically unnourished.But then, there are shots of a Rolling Stone cover article on the musicians by Mr. Crowe — repeatedly. And there’s a scene with group members and Matt Dillon in Mr. Crowe’s 1992 film, “Singles.” And there’s Mr. Crowe again, now expounding on camera. Note to fans: Keep watching. The band will return eventually.PEARL JAM TWENTYOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Cameron Crowe; director of photography, Nicola B.

SCOTT,"Review: In ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ Movie, Sex Is a Knotty Business","At the end of a recent New York sneak preview of “Fifty Shades of Grey” — in the blackout between the final lines of dialogue (“Anastasia!” “Christian!”) and the first breathy notes of the last Beyoncé song — a lot of the audience burst out laughing. The source of that laughter continues to puzzle and intrigue me, perhaps more than the actual movie did. Was it delight? Derision? Embarrassment? Surprise? All of the above?The last answer seems the most likely, since Sam Taylor-Johnson’s screen adaptation of E. L. James’s best seller is, like the book itself, a wildly confused treatment of a perennial confusing subject. Sex is a knotty business, perhaps all the more so when actual knots are involved, as they tend to be in the world of Christian Grey, the kinky billionaire bachelor who lends his name and his impressive collection of neckties to this Seattle-set tale of seduction, submission and commodity fetishism. Christian has a lot of psychic baggage, but for most of this installment in the “Fifty Shades” trilogy, it’s obscured by his physical stuff. In the tradition of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jay Gatsby, James Franco’s Alien (from “Spring Breakers”) and Kanye West’s Kanye West, this young mogul (played by Jamie Dornan) treats luxury consumption as an erotic passion and a spiritual calling. He has his own helicopter, which he pilots himself; an underground garage full of cars with a chauffeur to drive them; a penthouse apartment with a grand piano; and a walk-in closet so big that his suits hang without even touching.There’s also another room where he keeps his collection of canes, cuffs and other specialized equipment. Early in their relationship, he gives a tour to Anastasia Steele, his young inamorata, played with captivating sensitivity by Dakota Johnson. “That’s a flogger,” he explains, in one of several moments in Kelly Marcel’s script that sound a little redundant, and more than a little silly, when uttered on screen.Anastasia’s portion of the dialogue is more likely to be funny on purpose. Critics of Ms. James’s books have called attention to Ana’s habit of exclaiming “Wow!” and “Holy crap!” when a more heightened vocabulary (or no words at all) might seem to be called for. But the energy that brings her and Christian together is comic as well as sexual. She’s an ordinary, guileless, somewhat clueless young woman — kind of basic, as they say nowadays — pulled into the orbit of an enigmatic aristocrat with peculiar tastes and dark secrets. Their first meeting takes place in his office, where Anastasia, with her messy bangs and shapeless blue cardigan, looks absurdly out of place amid the sleek corporate Valkyries. “Fifty Shades” may have begun as “Twilight” fan fiction, but Ms. Taylor-Johnson wittily notes its kinship with “The Devil Wears Prada.” Not that professional ambition plays much of a role in Anastasia’s life. Or, for that matter, in Christian’s. He runs a big, vague company but doesn’t really seem to do much work. Ana is an English major who works part time in a hardware store, which is one of the places Christian shows up to surprise her. He’s always doing that — at a nightclub, at her apartment, at a hotel bar in Savannah, Ga., where she’s having a drink with her mom. It’s a little unnerving.Mr. Dornan, given the job of inspiring lust, fascination and also maybe a tiny, thrilling frisson of fear, succeeds mainly in eliciting pity. In print, Christian is a blur and a blank — a screen onto which any given reader can project a customized masculine ideal. On the screen, he risks becoming just some guy, which is how Mr. Dornan plays him, without mischief or mystery. There are actors who might have given Christian a jolt of naughty, bossy life, most of them creatures of an earlier movie era. Cary Grant. William Powell. Paul Newman. Sean Connery if you wanted the roughness a little closer to the surface. Jamie Bell was a convincing dominant in Lars von Trier’s “Nymphomaniac: Volume II,” though his character was more artisan than aristocrat. Mr. Dornan has the bland affect of a model, by which I mean a figure made of balsa wood or Lego. What vitality “Fifty Shades of Grey” possesses belongs to Ms. Johnson, who is a champion lip-biter and no slouch at blushing, eye-rolling and trembling on the verge of tears. She’s a good actress, in other words, and Ms. Taylor-Johnson matches the colors and the visual texture — the chilly blues and pulsing reds, the drab daylight and the velvety dusk — to Anastasia’s moods and desires.These are kind of a mess. The problem isn’t that she’s indecisive or conflicted or capricious, or that she reacts to Christian’s proposal of a formal, contractually established dominant-submissive relationship with ambivalence. Who wouldn’t? (And I’m not passing judgment on his lifestyle. It’s just that I have a strong bias against having sex with anyone who would use the word “incentivize” in conversation, as Christian does the very first time he and Anastasia lock eyes.) The problem is that as a character, Anastasia makes no sense. Her behavior has no logic, no pattern, no coherent set of causes or boundaries.In the book, this hardly matters. In fact, it’s something of an asset. Anastasia’s inner life exists to fill the space between sex scenes, and her zigzagging responses to Christian’s proposals make the fantasy more inclusive while also providing an escape clause. “Fifty Shades” is both daring and conventional, falling back into traditional gender roles even as it plays with transgressive desires. Christian’s sexual tastes are intriguing to Anastasia, but they are also the result of emotional wounds that she sets herself the task of healing. He wants to take charge of her, and she wants to take care of him. She tolerates the kind of sex he wants, and even enjoys some of it, but what she really wants is something more, and she wants to make him want that, too. She loves him, but love in these tales functions less as an emotional ideal than as a literary safe word, a return ticket to the land of romance. Reviewers have complained about Ms. James’s pedestrian prose, but the bad writing serves an important purpose. “Fifty Shades” not only destigmatizes kink, bringing bondage and spanking to airport bookstores and reading groups across the land. But it also, so to speak, de-sophisticates certain sexual practices, taking them out of the chateau and the boudoir and other fancy French places and planting them in the soil of Anglo-American banality. If E. L. James were a better writer, her books would be more — to use one of Anastasia’s favorite words — intimidating. And much less useful.The movie is neither one of those things. It dabbles in romantic comedy and splashes around in melodrama, but the one thing it can’t be — the thing the novel so trashily and triumphantly is — is pornography. Ms. Taylor-Johnson’s sex scenes are not that much different from other R-rated sex scenes, though there are more of them and more hardware is involved. You know the routine: an arched neck, some curled toes, a buttock here, a breast there, a wisp of pubic hair, a muffled moan, another Beyoncé song. Maybe a riding crop for variety. W.H. Auden once wrote that “the proof that pornography has no literary value is that, if one attempts to read it in any other way than as a sexual stimulus, to read it, say, as a psychological case-history of the author’s sexual fantasies, one is bored to tears.” In defiance of this irrefutable good sense, the “Fifty Shades” phenomenon has spawned innumerable kink-themed think pieces, though the analysis has dwelt less on Ms. James’s psyche than on the fantasies of the tens of millions of women who have bought her books. The writers transform their boredom into mockery and judgment as they circle around a tantalizing, perhaps frustrating question. Why do so many women read these novels, even though they have no literary value?I’m no expert, but I can venture a guess: for fun. They seem to be the kind of books you can simultaneously have fun with, make fun of, trash and cherish and adapt to the pursuit of your own pleasures. Which brings me back to the laughter at the end of the sneak preview. “Fifty Shades of Grey” might not be a good movie — O.K., it’s a terrible movie — but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment. “Fifty Shades of Grey” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The absurdities of “Tales From the Golden Age,” a facetiously titled anthology of six “urban legends” of Romanian life in the waning days of the Ceausescu dictatorship, aren’t that much crazier than everyday existence anywhere else in our paranoid world. Consider that in a typical episode of “The Office” you will find a gentler, miniature version of the same kind of dissembling, bureaucratic idiocy and hierarchical kowtowing. The difference, of course, is that the employees of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company of Scranton, Pa., don’t risk prison or worse after inadvertently offending a higher-up.A prime example of the Kafkian logic that infuses “Tales From the Golden Age” is its second story, “The Legend of the Party Photographer” (the titles of all six are prefaced by “the legend of”), which dryly observes the hullabaloo over a picture in Scinteia, the Romanian Communist Party’s daily newspaper.At an editorial huddle, it is decided that a photograph of a ceremonial meeting between Nicolae Ceausescu and President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing of France must be doctored to make Ceausescu look taller than his visitor. That having been accomplished amid much fuss, it is suddenly pointed out that the French leader is wearing a hat in the picture, while Ceausescu carries his hat in his hand.The frenzied editors fret that the photo depicts Communism deferring to capitalism, and a hat is airbrushed onto Ceausescu’s head. All is calm until it is discovered after the paper has been printed that no one thought to erase the hat still in the dictator’s hand. Again panic erupts, and bundles of newspapers are hastily unloaded from railroad cars. According to the legend scrawled at the end of the segment, it is the only time Scinteia didn’t reach its readership the next day.“Tales From the Golden Age” was overseen by Cristian Mungiu, the director of “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,” the dour masterpiece about a young woman’s nightmarish search for an abortion, which is now viewed as a cornerstone of the Romanian new wave. The director has called “Tales” a folk film, as opposed to a festival film like “4 Months.” It is a hearty satirical guffaw of gallows humor that illustrates how laughter helped buoy the spirits of an oppressed citizenry.Mr. Mungiu is credited as the screenwriter of the six vignettes. Four other filmmakers — Ioana Uricaru, Hanno Höfer, Razvan Marculescu, Constantin Popescu — have directorial credits along with Mr. Mungiu. Who directed which segment is not specified in the production notes.There are moments, especially in the first two tales, that conjure a maniacal Chaplinesque verve. In the first story, “The Legend of the Official Visit,” villagers frantically sweep the streets in anticipation of a drive-through by a government motorcade. An advance team arrives and insists that a flock of white pigeons be rounded up to greet the officials, although the only local fowl available are Cornish hens. A merry-go-round is ordered dismantled, but it is not. After all that effort the trip is rerouted at the last minute.Some stories are funnier and more cohesive than others. In “The Legend of the Chicken Driver,” about a poultry trucker who breaks the rules, and “The Legend of the Zealous Activist,” about an apparatchik’s attempt to corral the illiterate residents of a farming community and force them to learn to read, the comedy is muted.The strongest tales embrace a strain of barnyard humor that is matched by the robust performances of actors who convey an earthy jocularity. The movie doesn’t shy away from comparing these hardy, weather-beaten rustics to their livestock.One vignette revolves around a noisy pig given as a Christmas present to a policeman’s son living in a small town where pork, the traditional Christmas meat, is impossible to obtain. The urgent question facing his family: How do you slaughter a pig without making a racket that alerts your hungry neighbors to your bounty? The risky solution decided upon is to carry the beast indoors, seal it inside the kitchen, turn on the stove and gas it to death.Con artistry and theft proliferate. In “The Legend of the Air Sellers,” 18-year-old Crina (Diana Cavallioti) is visited in her apartment by Bughi (Radu Iacoban), a handsome young man posing as a government official collecting water samples in her building. Crina later attends a party at which Bughi shows a video of “Bonnie and Clyde,” and they strike up a friendship.Bughi confides to her that he dumps the water samples and sells the bottles. After Crina, who turns out to be even more avaricious than Bughi, conceives the notion of collecting samples of the air in people’s houses, they become their version of Bonnie and Clyde, knocking on doors and taking bogus samples.As docile inhabitants wait for the work to be done, they solemnly wave the empty bottles in a pretense of scientific seriousness. In a society this demoralized, no one questions the authority of whoever dares to assume it. Anyone who has the nerve can be an “inspector.”TALES FROM THE GOLDEN AGEOpens on Friday in Manhattan.A six-episode film directed by Ioana Uricaru, Hanno Höfer, Razvan Marculescu, Constantin Popescu and Cristian Mungiu; written by Mr. Mungiu; directors of photography, Oleg Mutu, Alex Sterian and Liviu Marghidan; edited by Dana Bunescu, Theodora Penciu and Ms. Uricaru; music by Mr. Höfer and Laco Jimi; production design by Cezara Armasu, Mihaela Poenaru, Dana Istrate and Simona Paduretu; costumes by Ms. Istrate, Brandusa Ioan, Luminita Mihai and Ana Ioneci; produced by Mr. Mutu and Mr. Mungiu; released by Sundance Selects.

851,2015-10-16,Experimenter,"John Palladino, Anthony Edwards, Jim Gaffigan, Peter Sarsgaard",USA,Michael Almereyda,"Biography, Drama, History",English,81.0,98.0,Michael Almereyda,2015,6.6,15330.0,86.0,2017-11-02 04:18:22,MANOHLA DARGIS,"Review: In ‘Experimenter,’ Are They Following Orders or Instincts?","In “Experimenter,” an aesthetically and intellectually playful portrait of the social psychologist Stanley Milgram, the director, Michael Almereyda, turns a biopic into a mind game. It’s an appropriate take on a figure who’s best remembered for his experiments in which subjects delivered punishing electric shocks on command. Working in the shadow of the Holocaust, and shortly after the capture of the SS official Adolf Eichmann, Milgram (1933-1984) was interested in questions of authority, conformity and conscience. “Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders,” Milgram asked. “Could we call them all accomplices?”The restlessly original Mr. Almereyda comes at this question inventively, sometimes with Milgram — a delicate, sensitive Peter Sarsgaard — talking right into the camera. Mr. Almereyda has a boundless gift for finding new ways to tell old stories, and “Experimenter,” as befits its title, is less a straight biography than a diverting gloss on human behavior, historical memory and cinema itself. It’s a story about a man whose work was haunted by the death camps, was conducted as the United States escalated its presence in Vietnam and was destined to speak to the ages (to the abuses at Abu Ghraib and beyond) because his subject — the all too human being — is reliably barbaric. (Mr. Almereyda’s films include the vampire tale “Nadja” and several Shakespeare adaptations, including a superb “Hamlet” with Ethan Hawke.)Mr. Almereyda takes Milgram, his work and ideas seriously but doesn’t suffocate them: Despite the story’s freight, the laboratory shocks and Milgram’s insistent melancholia, “Experimenter” is a nimble, low-frequency high. Mr. Almereyda’s self-conscious approach to the material hovers between the quasi-Brechtian and the gently absurd (as a director, his eyebrows are raised, not jumping), which keeps the story and characters grooving right along and ensures that while the past informs the story, it never torpedoes it. Milgram turns out to be somewhat of a downer, understandably so given his interests and the later harsh, career-damaging criticisms of his most famous work. His is very much a voice of the 20th century, but as he chronicles the age with Eeyore-like mournfulness he can also feel like one of history’s comedic straight men.Milgram conducted his first obedience experiments in 1961 at Yale, where he was an assistant professor. “I set up a simple experiment,” he explained, “to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist.” Individual test subjects — the ordinary citizens — were ushered into a room where a facilitator (called the experimenter) said the participant (called the teacher) would be administering electrical shocks to another participant (a middle-aged man called the learner) when the learner made a mistake. The teacher was to deliver the shocks via a bland apparatus that looked right out of a first-generation “Star Trek” episode and ostensibly zapped out 15 to 450 volts.It was all a sham: The learner was a confederate of the experiment, the teacher was the actual subject, and Milgram, of course, was the great experimenter, who, film director-like, watched his little fictions unfold from behind a two-way mirror. The movie opens just as one test is about to begin, with Milgram busily scribbling notes while talking aloud about his intentions. An assistant is parked next to him, but Milgram — as he often does — is addressing us. Inside the lab, a newly arrived, nervous teacher (the cannily cast Anthony Edwards) is settling in, meeting the blustery jolly learner (Jim Gaffigan) under the supervision of an experimenter (John Palladino) who’s wearing a lab coat, a funeral director’s poker face and a head of brilliantine hair.What did Milgram learn from his experiment? What did history? Mr. Almereyda circles around these questions slyly, poking at them (testing them) amid an occasional soliloquy and assorted biographical snippets, some featuring an excellent, wild-eyed Winona Ryder, who plays Sasha, Milgram’s wife. As he mixes austerely dressed sets with overtly artificial tableaus, Mr. Almereyda seems to be suggesting that Milgram, in his quest for truth, ended up living in a world that hovered between the real one and one of his own imagination.

In Mr. Miike’s enjoyably if wearyingly madcap “Yakuza Apocalypse,” gang warfare breaks out after the demise of a bloodsucking capo, drawing civilians and monsters into the fray as well.How the top gangster, Kamiura (Lily Franky), dies despite being undead involves a ruffle-collared English-speaking traveler and his magic gun. But that’s only the beginning of a pileup of events — not a story, strictly speaking — focused mostly on Kamiura’s eager-beaver second-in-command, Kageyama (Hayato Ichihara). He is bitten and faces a series of adversaries who include a killer nerd (the Indonesian whirlwind Yayan Ruhian) and a “terrorist” in a dumpy frog mascot suit.Figuring out who’s on which side, or why anyone does much of anything, is a fool’s errand. Mr. Miike’s narrative model is essentially the Kool-Aid commercials of the 1980s: Periodically, somebody new bursts into the room or onto the street, and a fight or something bizarre takes place.As a plotter of chaos, this Japanese filmmaker is a past master, canny enough to make you forget the lack of connections between set pieces (or that most of the action seems to transpire on a single street). And there’s a certain humor to the clash between the vagaries of vampirism — you join the club by being bitten — and the hierarchy of the yakuza, with its brutal ladder-climbing.By the end, however, you might be as punch-drunk as Kageyama in his final showdown, and too exhausted to care.",0,,,0
853,2011-09-09,The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu,"Nicolae Ceausescu, Elena Ceausescu, Stefan Andrei, Gheorghe Apostol","Romania, Germany",Andrei Ujica,"Documentary, Biography, History","Romanian, English",87.0,180.0,Andrei Ujica,2010,7.8,1176.0,88.0,2017-11-02 04:18:14,MANOHLA DARGIS,Popular Ascendance to Grim Downfall,"It’s impossible that “The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu” is the monument that the former Romanian dictator would have produced in his own honor. Among other things, it has an unhappy ending, at least for him and his wife, Elena, who were executed on Christmas Day, 1989. Yet in many respects Ceausescu turns out to be as much the author of this brilliant documentary as the director, Andrei Ujica, who waded through more than 1,000 hours of filmed state propaganda, official news reports and home movies to create a cinematic tour de force that tracks the rise, reign and grim fall of its subject.A Romanian who was born in 1951 and fled the country three decades later, Mr. Ujica has made several movies about the 1989 Romanian revolution and the collapse of Soviet-era Communism (“Videograms of a Revolution” and “Out of the Present”). The title of his latest was inspired by “The Autobiography of Fidel Castro,” a novel that in turn took its name from Gertrude Stein’s “Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.” Like the Stein book, a mock memoir that mixes fiction and nonfiction and was written by Stein from Toklas’s point of view, “Nicolae Ceausescu” is something of a rarefied ventriloquist act. It uses one body — here, the public and private Ceausescu — as a way to reveal the truth about another life, in this case that of a country under the totalitarian heel.Written and directed by Mr. Ujica, the documentary opens with smeary, jerky color images of the Ceausescus during their hastily convened and administrated trial shortly before their execution. Seated side by side, their backs to the wall, they look frail, shrunken. Accusations are announced, denials too. It’s all very fast and, for the uninitiated, perhaps confusing, especially given the lack of a voice-over or other explanations. Whether or not you’re schooled in Romanian history, though, it’s hard to reconcile these crude visuals with the pomp and parades that follow, which is the point. For decades, beginning in 1965, these two Lilliputians — Ceausescu hovered in the vicinity of 5 foot 5 — ruled a country that they turned into a projection of their self-mythologizing, a Potemkin village for two.After the opening trial, the movie shifts back in time and to extreme overhead images, filmed in sumptuous black and white, of hundreds upon hundreds of people running toward some unknown destiny. From this lofty perch you can’t see the faces of these men, women and children who take the beautifully abstracted, metaphorically potent shape of an undifferentiated, surging mass. Those faces come into clearer view in a later sequence with a state official that the historically minded (and Google researchers) will recognize as Ceausescu’s predecessor, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, a revolutionary who rose to power after World War II and held on until his death in 1965. And the small man helping carry out the Gheorghiu-Dej coffin? Why that’s the young Ceausescu, doing his best to look downcast.Whether he was shedding real tears or keeping a smile at bay, Ceausescu rarely seems to have done anything without a camera whirring nearby. Here he is in black and white, and there in color; here with sound and there without. Here and there he kisses gaga, swooning women; dances with villagers; claps old-timers on the back. Always, there are the people, massing and waiting and waving. Sometimes those masses gathered in Romania and at times in China and North Korea — both countries put on jaw-dropping shows — and also farther afield in Western countries like Britain that were willing to roll out the red carpet for Romania’s peripatetic first couple.Did the Ceausescus see what we see, what Mr. Ujica, working with his terrific editor and sound designer, Dana Bunescu, makes us see and understand? It’s unlikely, though it’s hard not to notice the difference in Ceausescu’s posture during an early visit, filmed in black and white, to a food market, its stocked shelves groaning with proletariat bread and Party promises, and a later, grimmer visit to a market shot in color. He’s older, of course, and grayer, though the hair still towers longingly upward. But by then even the Romanian propaganda machine couldn’t obscure the despair hanging over the increasingly desolate cities and a people whose early smiles had long disappeared, along with the promises.THE AUTOBIOGRAPHYOF NICOLAE CEAUSESCUOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Andrei Ujica; edited by Dana Bunescu; produced by Velvet Moraru; released by the Film Desk.

After a hedge fund manager (Laurent Lafitte), based in France, strips Richard’s company of its value, Kate agrees to accompany her former husband to Paris, where the two will demand their money back.When that fails, what else can they do but rob a $10.8 million jewel from the villain’s fiancée (Louise Bourgoin)? A fellow couple (Timothy Spall and Celia Imrie) aid them in this endeavor, which involves kidnapping and impersonating wealthy Texans. As justification, Kate rails against financial fat cats; still, down to its rote soundtrack selections (“All Right Now,” “Takin’ Care of Business”), the film feels too complacent to embody a true fight-the-man spirit.As in ’60s confections like “Topkapi” — a filmmaking tradition “The Love Punch” self-consciously emulates — some wonderful actors add class to the material, which struggles to find a consistent register of cartoonishness. (The quartet’s wedding-crash-by-snorkel-and-cliff-climb might have impressed James Bond.) The antics bear little resemblance to those that follow actual divorce and financial ruin, any more than “The Love Punch” resembles the films that compete at Cannes.“The Love Punch” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

855,2014-01-10,Inside Llewyn Davis,"Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Ethan Phillips","USA, UK, France","Ethan Coen, Joel Coen","Drama, Music",English,93.0,104.0,"Joel Coen, Ethan Coen",2013,7.5,118082.0,92.0,2017-11-02 04:18:18,A. O. SCOTT,Melancholy Odyssey Through the Folk Scene,"“If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it’s a folk song,” Llewyn Davis says, brandishing his guitar during a set at the Gaslight. That’s a pretty good definition, one that certainly applies to “Hang Me, Oh Hang Me,” the chestnut that opens “Inside Llewyn Davis,” Joel and Ethan Coen’s intoxicating ramble through Greenwich Village in 1961, before the neighborhood was annexed by New York University and Starbucks. Llewyn’s repertoire and some aspects of his background are borrowed from Dave Van Ronk, who loomed large on the New York folk scene in its pre-Bob Dylan hootenanny-and-autoharp phase. Oscar Isaac, who plays both Llewyn and the guitar with offhand virtuosity, is slighter of build and scowlier of mien than Van Ronk, with a fine, clear tenor singing voice. But in any case, this is not a biopic, it’s a Coen brothers movie, which is to say a brilliant magpie’s nest of surrealism, period detail and pop-culture scholarship. To put it another way, it’s a folk tale.The story — a wobbly, circular journey to nowhere in particular and back, with stops in Chicago, Queens and the Upper West Side — is nearly as old as narrative itself. An important character is named Ulysses, whose ancient wanderings inspired “O Brother, Where Art Thou?,” the Coens’ earlier venture (also in the company of the music supervisor T Bone Burnett) into American vernacular musical traditions. The loneliness and romance of the traveling life are echoed in the ballads, sea chanteys and blues reveries that Llewyn and his fellow chirpers like to sing. The lyrics palpitate with the pain of loss and leave-taking: “I’m 500 miles from my home”; “I’ve been all around this world”; “Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.” Llewyn, still grieving over the death of his musical partner (heard singing in the voice of Marcus Mumford), is a bit more prosaically adrift, stumbling from one friend’s couch to another, wearing out his welcome faster than his shoes.But if Llewyn is an archetype, he is also a familiar kind of Coen antihero, the latest face in the gallery of losers, deadbeats and hapless strivers the brothers have been assembling, over 16 features, for nearly 30 years. These dudes are usually at the mercy of other people, a hostile universe and their own stupidity. Above all, they are the playthings of a pair of cruel and capricious fraternal deities whose affection for their creatures is often indistinguishable from contempt. Unlike Barton Fink, Llewyn is a genuinely talented artist. Unlike Larry Gopnik in “A Serious Man,” he is not merely the innocent, passive victim of cosmic, domestic and professional malpractice. He is, to some extent, the author of his own fate. “You’re like King Midas’s idiot brother,” says Jean (Carey Mulligan), a fellow folk singer whose nest Llewyn has fouled, offering a precise and scatological explanation of just what she means.The catalog of Llewyn’s lapses is extensive and fills the spectrum from casual bad manners to epic jerkiness. He makes the hostess (Robin Bartlett) cry at a dinner party in Morningside Heights, swears in front of his young nephew in Queens, heckles other acts at the Gaslight and has a habit of getting women pregnant, including Jean, who is romantically and harmonically attached to a singer named Jim (Justin Timberlake). The only misdeed that seems to trouble Llewyn’s conscience at all is letting an orange cat escape from an apartment where he’s crashing. It’s almost as if he thinks that rescuing the animal will make up for everything else he has done.Llewyn is a fairly unpleasant guy, though the other inhabitants of his world are not much better. The nice ones — a couple of tall, affable singers (Stark Sands and Adam Driver, suggesting Tom Paxton and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott), a kindly Columbia sociologist (Ethan Phillips) and the unsuspecting Jim — serve as targets for his sarcasm. The rest are mostly a parade of grotesques, including music promoters, union officials and an imperious, drug-addicted jazzman (John Goodman) whose company Llewyn must endure on a long car trip.They are the equivalent of goblins and monsters, placed in the path of the hero to strengthen his character and test his resolve. But since this is a Coen brothers film, it is predestined that Llewyn will fail and that we will laugh both at and with him as he deals with a world full of cretins, including the one he sees reflected in the windows of the subway train.His world, though, is also an enchanted place, animated by the dark, nimble magic of the Coens and their collaborators. The production designer, Jess Gonchor; the art director, Deborah Jensen; and the cinematographer, Bruno Delbonnel, conjure a Manhattan of faded denim and espresso-bar steam, a wintry island that we might recognize from old album covers. And amid the smart pastiche and the sly, carefully constructed jokes there is a thread of real emotion, a strain of melancholy deeper and more mysterious than mere sympathy.Sympathy may not be what Llewyn deserves. He doesn’t ask for it, and Mr. Isaac, a versatile character actor here ascending to the highest levels of his craft, refuses the easy road of charm. Like his character, he trusts his own professionalism and the integrity of the material. Llewyn is not a showman. He relies, sometimes foolishly, on the strength of his voice, his playing and the resonance of those old songs.The musical performances do more than enrich the movie; they complete it. Two in particular deliver on the promise of the title, illuminating the strange way that borrowed words and chords can tap into reservoirs of otherwise inaccessible feeling. When Llewyn sings “The Death of Queen Jane” at an audition and “Shoals of Herring” in his father’s room at a rest home for retired seamen, you feel the full weight of his humanity, even though he is really just doing his job.One of the insights of “Inside Llewyn Davis” is that hard work and talent do not always triumph in the end. Like most of the Coens’ movies, this one sidesteps the political turmoil of its period, partly because it is a fable, not a work of history. (The public affairs of the time get a shout-out in the form of a goofy novelty song called “Please Mr. Kennedy,” a barely topical sendup of the space race and the New Frontier.) But there is nonetheless a strong, hidden current of social criticism in the brothers’ work, which casts a consistently skeptical eye on the American mythology of success.Winners do not interest them. There’s no success like failure, and failure’s no success at all. That observation was made by Bob Dylan, like Joel and Ethan Coen, a Jewish kid from Minnesota and, like them, possessed of a knack for conscripting the American popular art of the past for his own idiosyncratic genius. His art, like theirs, upends easy distinctions between sincerity and cynicism, between the authentic and the artificial, and both invites and resists interpretation. So I won’t speculate further on what “Inside Llewyn Davis” might mean. But at least one of its lessons seems to me, after several viewings, as clear and bright as a G major chord. We are, as a species, ridiculous: vain, ugly, selfish and self-deluding. But somehow, some of our attempts to take stock of this condition — our songs and stories and moving pictures, old and new — manage to be beautiful, even sublime. “Inside Llewyn Davis” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

A spineless doormat, Shamoto is flattered by the unexpected attentions of Murata (Denden), the voluble owner of a magnificent fish emporium. In short order, Murata has bedded Taeko and all but adopted Mitsuko; he has also made Shamoto an unwilling accomplice to his psychopathic killing sprees.Directed by the Japanese provocateur Sion Sono, “Cold Fish” gradually evolves from a small domestic drama into a symphony of mauled breasts, marital rape and mutilated corpses. Propelled by slaughterhouse levels of gore and wickedly absurdist humor, the film mitigates its brutality with committed acting and a script that smartly plumbs the relationship between the cramped Japanese home — the lack of windows, the shrunken appliances — and familial violence.Space deprivation features as prominently as male dominance, the vast, aquariumlike atmosphere of Murata’s store contrasting painfully with Shamoto’s cramped little fish shop. Even his microwave is minuscule.Punctuated with rough sex between dirty old men and compliant young women, “Cold Fish” is about the making of a monster. Date-and-time-stamped scenes suggest the inexorability of Shamoto’s decline, from which the director maintains a cool distance.

The Austrian director Nikolaus Geyrhalter holds the shot long enough for you to appreciate that it’s meant to resonate, but it’s uncertain what makes either this image or the green field significant. What, you may reasonably wonder, are you to glean from a banal 21st-century image like that of a surveillance camera, particularly when Mr. Geyrhalter doesn’t offer any obvious explanation?Decoding some films can involve degrees of easy, hard, familiar or frustrating effort, of course, and Mr. Geyrhalter sometimes likes to give his viewers a bit of a workout. That initially seems true of his 2005 movie, “Our Daily Bread,” a nonfiction look at industrial food production. It doesn’t have a narrator or talking-head experts, but a distinct point of view emerges from the images of the often heavily mechanized production of foodstuffs — from baby chicks to olives — and from the relentlessness of Mr. Geyrhalter’s gaze. With “Our Daily Bread” he wants to show you, make you really see, what remains comfortably out of sight in such production, including cruelty to animals. The movie’s title, taken from the Lord’s Prayer, adds another layer of commentary.“Abendland” is more challenging to parse. On the simplest level it consists of 90 minutes of nocturnal images of men and women at work and at play across Europe, some of whom are watching other people through cameras and monitors. That opening shot of the surveillance camera, for instance, is followed by one of an unidentified man looking at what appears to be the same green field on a monitor. He points out a rabbit and a car; mentions the border. What follows are more night scenes, including one in which more unidentified people take calls at a Dutch suicide prevention center; another in which Spanish guards patrol a fence; and a sequence in a Bavarian playground where hundreds, maybe thousands, of revelers sing, eat rotisserie chicken and drain beer steins.The overall impression is a vision of Europe as a mosaic, as an artful amalgam of perfectly framed, seemingly disconnected moments during a long shared night, give or take a time zone change or two. It is a vision that recalls Benedict Anderson’s influential 1983 book, “Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,” in which he defines a nation as “an imagined political community — and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.” Mr. Anderson argues that nations are socially constructed (“imagined”), because, while most of their members never meet face to face, they can imagine one another in communion, as when they read the same newspaper. (It’s an old book!) It is this sense of fraternity that leads people to die on behalf of their countries.With “Abendland,” Mr. Geyrhalter has created a portrait of an “imagined community” that’s readily recognizable as Europe (if devoid of swarming tourists). It’s easy at least to guess what he has in mind by combining shots of surveillance cameras and border fences (which suggest keeping outsiders out) with culturally specific blowouts like Oktoberfest: that the different nationalisms often seen to have defined and nearly destroyed Europe — and are here evoked by images of singing Bavarians in lederhosen — have been supplanted by a Europe that is itself an imagined community. “The people here enjoy safety and prosperity,” Mr. Geyrhalter says in a statement on the movie’s Web site. “What enables this privileged life is exclusivity, restricting enjoyment of the benefits, and limiting participation, for the simple reason that the available resources wouldn’t be sufficient otherwise.”He concludes by saying:“Whoever lives in paradise must be prepared to protect it. A film about Europe in the early 21st century.” It’s impossible to know from the movie whether Mr. Geyrhalter believes this paradise needs protecting or whether something in his words — irony, fury, laughter — was lost in translation. As he has before, in “Abendland” he shows you images that aren’t always readily visible, like those of the heavily fortified fences in the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa. What to make of such fences is up to you, as is whether the movie’s title is diagnostic or predictive. It is worth noting that “Abendland” means “evening land” and is sometimes used to mean “the West,” as in the German historian Oswald Spengler’s famed study of Western culture, “The Decline of the West.”",0,,,1
858,2013-01-18,Outside Satan,"David Dewaele, Alexandra Lemâtre, Christophe Bon, Juliette Bacquet",France,Bruno Dumont,Drama,French,63.0,110.0,Bruno Dumont (screenplay),2011,6.3,1569.0,,2017-11-02 04:18:16,A. O. SCOTT,Minimalism Wrapped in a Mystery,"In his “Notes on Cinematography,” the great French director Robert Bresson argued against the use of music in films. “Noises must become music,” he wrote. Many of Bresson’s techniques and ideas — the employment of nonprofessional actors, the adaptation of naturalistic means to spiritual ends — have taken hold among European filmmakers in the past decade or so. Perhaps nowhere more strikingly than in the work of Bruno Dumont, whose second feature, “Humanité,” won the Grand Prix in Cannes in 1999, the year of Bresson’s death.Mr. Dumont’s latest movie, “Hors Satan” (“Outside Satan”), is full of Bressonian music, provided by a sound mix that emphasizes footsteps trudging along rural roads, the heavy breathing of bodies in motion, the song of birds and the sighing of wind. Human speech is minimal, as are conventional elements of cinematic storytelling.The two principal characters, played by David Dewaele and Alexandra Lematre, are identified in the credits only as “the Guy” and “the Girl.” They spend a lot of time wandering the fields and pathways of a drab and marshy northern French countryside, their mostly silent, idle days punctuated by spasms of violence and eruptions of metaphysical strangeness.He is either a saint or a sociopath, or perhaps both, with a silent, watchful demeanor and what may be magical powers. He is protective of the girl, dealing brutally with the men who take a predatory or even mildly romantic interest in her, though he turns aside her sexual advances. In one of the first scenes he kills her stepfather, a crime that attracts mild concern from the local gendarmes.The people in most of Mr. Dumont’s films, even though they live in a recognizably modern world, occupy a primitive, almost animalistic state of being, beyond the reach — or beneath the notice — of any civilizing force. But this brute condition also gives them special access to grace, as if dumbness were close to godliness. It is possible to find this notion intellectually dubious (I would suggest that it is hard not to) while still acknowledging the aesthetic power of Mr. Dumont’s fables, and especially of the sounds and images out of which he constructs them.He and his cinematographer, Yves Cape, use the dense grain of 35-millimeter celluloid, natural light and shallow-focus lenses to distill poetry from plain faces and drab landscapes. Mr. Dewaele’s craggy features might remind you of David Carradine, while Ms. Lematre’s pale, smooth skin and impassive expressions have some of the eerie suggestiveness of silent-film heroines. They are fascinating to look at and also studiously opaque, perhaps in keeping with Bresson’s strictures against acting and in favor of performers “enclosed in the mystery of their appearance.”“Hors Satan” leans a little too heavily on its mysteries, teasing the viewer with possible interpretations of what happens between the Girl and the Guy, and also between the two of them and the cosmos they inhabit. Despite its pictorial intensity and the extremity of some of its scenes, the film proceeds in a mood of detachment, turning the suffering physical beings under its scrutiny into abstractions.",0,,,0

SCOTT,Swept Away and Torn Apart in a Sea of Despair,"The Asian tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004, killed almost a quarter-million people in 14 countries. The scale and speed of the devastation defy comprehension, and no movie could be expected to convey the full measure of the horror. But disaster, real and imagined, is a staple of the modern cinematic imagination, and an event like the tsunami presents itself to an ambitious filmmaker as both a technical challenge and a moral risk.“The Impossible,” the second feature from the Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, uses digital imagery, meticulous sound design and tried-and-true editing techniques to recreate both the violence of unleashed waters and the desolation that followed their assault on southern Thailand. Much more than Clint Eastwood’s “Hereafter,” which used the tsunami as a framing device for one of its tales of supernatural obsession, “The Impossible” plunges the audience into the catastrophe and then immerses us in the panic, grief and disorientation of the aftermath.Mr. Bayona’s first film, “The Orphanage,” was a horror movie, a ghost story whose unusual emotional intensity was grounded in the anxious, desperate bond between mother and child. “The Impossible” is also, in its way, a horror film, with nature as the malevolent force threatening innocent lives. The dramatic emphasis is on the anguish of a mother and her son, who survive the waves and are separated from the rest of their family.As the movie opens, Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor), an English couple living in Japan, are flying to Thailand with their three sons for a Christmas vacation at a luxurious beach resort. (The real people whose experiences inform “The Impossible” were a Spanish family of five on a similar trip.) They are troubled by the usual stresses — Henry worries about his job; Maria, a doctor who stopped practicing when they moved to Japan, wonders if she should go back to work; the boys bicker and whine — but they seem to be very nice people having a very good time.Mr. Bayona and the screenwriter, Sergio G. Sánchez, do not spend much time filling in nuances of character. That job is left to the actors, who rise brilliantly to the task of showing the reactions of ordinary people to extreme circumstances. Maria is washed inland along with her oldest son, Lucas (Tom Holland), and is badly injured by the time they reach relatively dry land. Her fear, exhaustion and ferocious maternal determination dominate the first half of the movie, and Ms. Watts moves through these emotional states with instinctive grace and an intensity that is never showy. Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor.And Mr. McGregor, his antic youthful energy tamed but not entirely suppressed, is a very persuasive and touching dad in distress. It is not giving much away to disclose that Henry and the two younger boys, Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) also survive; Mr. Bayona is a nimble manipulator of audience feelings, but not a sadist. And his emphasis is less on the possibility of death than on the logistics of staying alive and searching for information and help. The sometimes excruciating suspense of “The Impossible” comes from the efforts of the parents and children to find one another despite geographic displacement, a shattered communication system and a chaotic relief effort.Survivors are also witnesses, and “The Impossible” shows us, through the eyes of one unbelievably lucky family, some terrible things, including mangled bodies and parents in despair. But as Maria and Henry’s ordeal unfolds, the film’s focus starts to feel distressingly narrow. Virtually everyone shown suffering after the tsunami is a European, Australian or American tourist, and the fact that the vast majority of the dead, injured and displaced were Asian never really registers. At one point Maria and Lucas are cared for by residents of a small village and later they are helped by Thai doctors, but these acts of selfless generosity are treated like services to which wealthy Western travelers are entitled. And the terrible effects of the tsunami on the local population are barely acknowledged.This is not to dismiss the real anguish of people like the family on whose miraculous survival Mr. Bayona’s movie is based, nor to scold the director for making this movie instead of another. But there is a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in “The Impossible,” which is less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday.

Set in South Africa in the usual bummer future — yet again, it’s man against man, as well as machine — the movie imagines a scenario in which tin-can police march in lock step with their human analogues to roust the usual tattooed and dreadlocked gun-toting degenerates. All the aerial shots of the dangerously swarming and swelling multitudes suggest that such draconian tactics are necessary. The director Neill Blomkamp, working with a script he wrote with his wife, Terri Tatchell, doesn’t engage with the question of whether a police state is necessary; he just goes with the paramilitary flow. And, as an introductory flurry of news reports indicates, law demands order. To help stem the murderous tide, the authorities have deployed a force of armed robots, called Scouts, to serve as shields for their human brethren or to fire on the heavily fortified shouting masses. Mr. Blomkamp, who directed the back-to-back science-fiction tales “District 9” and “Elysium,” has a real feel for dystopia, and he persuasively sets a chaotic scene, partly by again shooting in the real Johannesburg.Given the big studio way, it’s no surprise that the robots, with their matte gray cladding and rabbit ears, swiveling heads and articulated limbs, have been created with more attention to detail than the story. After the preliminaries, a protagonist emerges in the person of Deon (Dev Patel), an engineer for the outfit that churns out the Scouts. His only colleagues who, at that point, seem vaguely sentient are his boss, Michelle (Sigourney Weaver), and a teeth-gnashing foe, Vincent (Hugh Jackman), who parades around with a gun on his belt. One night, Deon takes a decommissioned robot home and, after some Red Bull and energetic keyboard abuse, solves the problem of artificial intelligence. Enter Chappie, played with a singsong by Sharlto Copley, Mr. Blomkamp’s favorite attraction.Things go wrong like genre clockwork, and Chappie ends up in the hands of a troika of misfit criminals who decide that a smart robot would make a useful accessory to go with their pink and yellow guns, which look as finger-licking good as Valentine’s candy. The South African musicians Ninja (the guy) and Yo-Landi Visser (the woman), bring the cartoon charisma as the flashiest two thirds of this trio, with the American actor Jose Pablo Cantillo, as Yankie, valiantly thumping along as the third wheel. A well-greased matched set, Yo-Landi Visser and Ninja (the characters share the performers’ names), take to Chappie-rearing seriously and soon teach the robot how to talk, shoot and stroll like a gangsta while he, in turn, takes jerky baby steps and calls them Mommy and Daddy. It’s a goof, as is so much of “Chappie” despite the violence, crenelated brows and choreographed grimaces. For all of Mr. Blomkamp’s attention to grim speculative fiction and its trappings (the despair, the gadgets), he often seems more at ease when things are going right for his characters or when he’s lobbing a joke. Sometimes he uses comedy as a distraction or to soft-pedal an emotion or an idea. It’s funny when Chappie watches the cartoon “He-Man and the Masters of the Universe,” because you see him learning, but the scene also gestures to the idea that hyperbolic masculinity is absurd learned behavior. And when Yo-Landi reads a children’s book or chatters sweetly to Chappie, something rather more surprising happens because Mr. Blomkamp has let real emotions creep in, too.Mr. Blomkamp may be genuinely interested in artificial intelligence, but he doesn’t engage with it (as, say, Steven Spielberg did in “A.I.”) as much as desultorily kick it around. It’s as if he felt that he needed an excuse to trot out his robot, as if one were ever needed. It’s no wonder his nods to earlier texts — from the different iterations of “Frankenstein” to “RoboCop” — register as little more than shorthand for ideas that have been worked out more fully elsewhere. In some movies, allusions to other movies build on earlier thinking or, at times, become an index of authorial self-regard, intended mostly to close the distance between the original and the copy. Here, the allusions feel like the handiwork of someone who’s eager to make something cool and so borrows with promiscuous abandon.This is Mr. Blomkamp’s third feature, and he’s still finding his way as a director; again and again, as in the past, he struggles with the material, a performance, an idea, the tone or just some blocking. “Chappie” is more visibly modest and less narratively ambitious than his last movie, “Elysium,” which benefited greatly from Matt Damon’s emotionally anchoring star turn as an Everyman struggling among the human-made ruins. Scaling down has its drawbacks, as some of the visible digital artifacts in “Chappie” make clear. Yet even at his shakiest, Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention with stories about characters banding together to emerge from a hell not of their own making, a liberation journey that just isn’t the same old, same old when a director was born in South Africa.“Chappie” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

This film — adapted by John Stephenson, a former vice president and creative supervisor of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, from the book by the prolific preacher Max Lucado — relates the weak-tea parable of a town that receives a wish-giving candle every 25 years from an angel.When the skeptical Rev. David Richmond (Hans Matheson) takes a post in the parish, he grows intent on displacing the candle as a kind of false idol. For a while, he wins people over by doing chores and home repairs, but then he nearly sets his flock aflame after pridefully installing electric lighting in the church. The character lights up most when visiting a fetching shopgirl (Samantha Barks, who evokes the millennial more than the fin de siècle).The Mike Leigh stalwart Lesley Manville plays the candlemaker’s wife, all aflutter over the angel’s gift, which she and her husband have the duty to bestow. Every family in town has some complaint meriting attention: blindness, muteness, spinsterism.The film has a diligent homeyness (apart from hastily wrapping up the story of an unwed mother introduced at the beginning), and it takes delight in around-the-town bits of business and words like “chasuble” and “codswallop.” Susan Boyle turns up to sing and play a church warden’s wife.

Abigail Disney, a busy producer of hard-hitting documentaries (“Citizen Koch”), is making her directorial debut with this conventional but effective conversation starter, a chronicle of morally grounded politics that deploys some sound reasoning.Partisan issues are often narrowly argued in nonfiction films and warrant some wariness. Yet Ms. Disney chooses dramatically compelling personalities and plays out their trains of thought in persuasive ways. We tag along as two figures are moved by fatal shootings to speak out: the Rev. Rob Schenck, president of the Christian lobbyist group Faith & Action and a leading abortion foe in the 1990s; and Lucia McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis, a black teenager who was killed by a white software developer in 2012 in a confrontation over loud music. (The death cast a renewed spotlight on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law.)The high-gloss visuals and the stage-managed feel of its encounters make Ms. Disney’s demonstrative film easy to dismiss, and the incessant background music evokes a neighbor’s unattended stereo. But Mr. Schenck’s colloquies with gun-friendly conservative peers and his voice-over commentary hit the mark, as do Ms. McBath’s TV-friendly but sincere displays of grief and resolve.Most important, the film presents some fresh-sounding arguments about Christianity and guns as intriguing jumping-off points rather than open-and-shut cases. Not every point of view portrayed in the film will sit well with each viewer, but Mr. Schenck and Ms. McBath do their utmost to act in good faith.

The men are long gone, and soon enough the three must reckon with a predatory pair of Union soldiers (Sam Worthington and Kyle Soller). The louts notice Augusta when she journeys out for medicine, and their nighttime siege of the three women dominates the film.Rather than a credible historical setting, the deserted wartime landscape is more a backdrop for drawn-out showdowns and portentous moments, broken up by an overbearing score. Mr. Barber and the screenwriter Julia Hart take the feminist potential of the premise for granted, rather than nurturing the story into something as rich as, say, Don Siegel’s “The Beguiled,” a 1971 portrait of another house of women during the Civil War.Mr. Barber can work up a fair sense of menace, but he seems to have directed most of the talented cast to speak their lines in a mannered fashion learned from other movies. Mad is an especially unfortunate font of homespun wisdom, and when she finally delivers a shattering monologue, the effect is lost through its self-conscious staging.To a certain extent, Mr. Barber, who also directed the Michael Caine movie “Harry Brown,” has simply made a mild exploitation film in dress-up, but he’s overly concerned with ensuring every line leaves its mark.“The Keeping Room” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Despite a reputation for slashing at the jugular, Mr. LaBute has done the equivalent of rolling over and letting his belly be rubbed with this tale of an especially eventful layover in Albuquerque.Les (Matthew Broderick) and Natalie (Alice Eve) are co-workers on the way to a presentation when storm warnings strand them in New Mexico. In the odd setting of the layover airport, Les begins acting rather furtively, leading to questions from Natalie. It emerges — as something reliably does in Mr. Labute’s films — that Les’s last visit to the city involved mind-blowing extramarital drunken sex, possibly with another man.It was a night to remember, or not, as Les has settled into a fog of denial and sexual confusion, even though his helpless curiosity seems poised to part the curtains on the past. Natalie, a sylphlike figure in black, sympathizes with her middle-aged, bumbling colleague, partly because of her own relationship with another woman and the related growing pains.And so the two embark on a journey into sunny Albuquerque, home to dopey cabbies, filmmaking tax incentives and a gay bar called Zorro. Mr. Broderick plays his familiar starchy married nebbish with something like a sense of duty and a straitjacketed folksiness, as if warding off the kind of gay-panic punch lines a mainstream comedy might deliver. Ms. Eve, who starred in Mr. LaBute’s “Some Velvet Morning,” is at times touching to watch softening up as she and Les take each other into confidence. But her unplaceable British-accented character looks a bit alien amid generic talk of a “big account” in Dallas.What’s most curious is Mr. Labute’s kid-glove treatment of the scenario, forgoing real sexual gamesmanship, much less the opportunistic rug-pulling in past films. That baseline of sincerity is refreshing to a point, yet he’s written a fairly weak-tea story of conflicted self-discovery that would make for a mildly engaging evening on the stage. Put another way, “Dirty Weekend” is more like the movie Les might make than Natalie would; it almost dares you not to call it conventional.Like other movies directed by Mr. LaBute, the film has a slight hotel-lobby artifice to its settings (even outdoors). That tactic feels at odds with its toddle into genuine sentiment, but maybe, as for Les, it marks a fresh step in a different direction whose full ramifications are yet to come.",0,,,0

O. SCOTT,Review: &#8216;The Look of Silence&#8217; Confronts Individuals and Ideology of Indonesian Massacre,"“The Look of Silence,” a documentary directed by the American filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer and an anonymous Indonesian collaborator, is a painful, profoundly empathetic work of moral reckoning. Like its companion film, “The Act of Killing,” released in 2013, it examines the mass killings that began in Indonesia in 1965, when at least a million people were slaughtered in the aftermath of a military coup. In the earlier movie, perpetrators of the massacres eagerly re-enact their crimes, borrowing costumes and attitudes from American genre movies, as if they were western or film noir heroes. In “The Look of Silence,” it is clear that many of the killers, whose political sponsors are still in power, feel little or no regret for their actions. On the contrary, they bask in a glow of righteous vindication. A death squad commander matter-of-factly talks about “exterminating Communists” for several months and concludes that “because this was an international matter, we should be given a gift. We should be rewarded with a trip to America.” Recalling the Cold War context of the atrocities, he notes that “America taught us to hate Communists.”Mr. Oppenheimer, filming in Indonesia over more than a decade, found that this ideology was still very much in place. “The Look of Silence” visits a classroom where young children are taught that the killings were justified. Elsewhere, they are celebrated. Early in the film, two elderly men stroll down an overgrown path to the banks of the Snake River, gleefully demonstrating how they beat their captives, dragged them by the feet and then hacked them to death with knives and machetes. Their laughter is all the more horrifying for seeming free and un-self-conscious, as if they were recalling incidents of youthful mischief.We watch video of the two men, around 10 years after it was shot, in the company of Adi Rukun, a soft-spoken ophthalmologist whose brother Ramli was killed by the Komando Aksi, a paramilitary organization in the Aceh Province of Indonesia. Mr. Rukun was born in 1968, and he is haunted less by traumatic memories than by their terrible absence. His mother recalls the day of Ramli’s disappearance with unbearable clarity and undiluted sorrow, while his father, who is frail, mostly blind and over 100, drifts in and out of awareness.Mr. Rukun sets out, along with Mr. Oppenheimer and a film crew, to confront his brother’s killers. Sometimes he conducts eye exams while asking questions, his professional bearing blending with his gentle, insistent manner of interrogation. The encounters are, for the most part, unnervingly calm and decorous. For half a century, survivors have lived among those responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. Political authorities, neighbors, even relatives and friends have blood on their hands, and acknowledge as much. A few go further, telling of how they drank their victims’ blood, a practice they credit with saving them from the madness that afflicted some of their colleagues.Amid the laughter, the boasting and the superstition, there are some of the expected evasions and excuses. The killers were only following orders, or targeting bad people, or caught up in the chaos of the times. It was so long ago, Mr. Rukun is told. Why stir up bad memories?Even when specific atrocities are admitted — or bragged about — ultimate responsibility is pushed away. Death squad members say they were fulfilling the mandates of the military, while politicians insist that the slaughter was the spontaneous expression of popular will. It’s suggested at one point that the “Communists” offered themselves up, asking to be killed as punishment for their transgressions.With a single exception — an old NBC news report from the mid-1960s — Mr. Oppenheimer avoids the archival footage and explanatory material that usually fill out historical documentaries. His approach is more like Claude Lanzmann’s in “Shoah,” which surveyed the Holocaust by rigorously focusing on the faces and words of witnesses, survivors and participants. The mood of “The Look of Silence” is tranquil. Its settings — modest houses and sun-dappled gardens, far from the urban bustle of “The Act of Killing” — are peaceful, and Mr. Rukun is a quiet man, contemplating his family’s tragedy more in sorrow than in anger. But this atmosphere has the effect of making the violence at the film’s heart all the more shocking. Movies have helped make even extreme brutality seem banal (that was part of the message of “The Act of Killing”), but hearing a simple, factual account of an atrocity can be almost unbearable. “After such knowledge, what forgiveness?” T. S. Eliot asked that question, in his poem “Gerontion,” almost a century ago, and it has hovered over much subsequent history. Mr. Oppenheimer and his collaborators pose it with renewed urgency and poignancy, and also suggest the ways that, in Indonesia, forgiveness is still premature. The silence they discover is not a failure of acknowledgment, but the refusal of apology. “The Look of Silence” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

O. SCOTT,"Review: In ‘The Gunman,’ Sean Penn Plays a Remorseful Sniper on the Run","It’s not a hard and fast rule, but in general when the main character, sometime in the third act, says, “I did some bad things ... ” and stares off into the middle distance, the implied end of the sentence is “including this movie.” I take no particular pleasure in reporting that this is the case in “The Gunman,” a globe-trotting action thriller and also, in passing, a melodrama of male sexual jealousy, an indictment of Western meddling in Africa and a concussion-awareness public service announcement.All of which could be worthy and interesting. Sean Penn, who plays Jim Terrier, the titular shooter, afflicted by conscience and a head injury, has done some indisputably great things. And among the guys he pistol whips and pals around with here are Javier Bardem, Mark Rylance, Ray Winstone and Idris Elba, all fine actors not above a bit of genre showboating. The atmosphere is leathery and masculine, redolent of stale cologne and weary bravado, with a token woman (the Italian actress Jasmine Trinca) whose job is to be menaced, protected and partially undressed. She is allowed to drive a car, but the fighting and shooting — the bad things that are also, in a movie like this, the cool things and the important things — are left to the men.At the start of the movie Annie (Ms. Trinca) is Jim’s girl, and he is an American sniper pretending to provide security to humanitarian relief workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While Annie tries to do good amid the atrocities of that country’s long civil war, Jim and his colleagues conspire to assassinate a government minister who is inconveniently trying to renegotiate contracts with multinational mining companies. The guy running the conspiracy is Felix (Mr. Bardem), who uses the operation as a pretext to steal Annie from Jim.Eight years later, Jim is back in Congo digging wells, surfing and condescending to the locals — in other words, doing penance for his earlier misdeeds and trying to forget about his lost love. But a bunch of men with machetes and assault rifles show up (shouting “Where’s the white man?”) to drag him back into the old life. Jim is chased from London to Barcelona to Gibraltar, and Mr. Penn, grimacing and flexing his impressive brows and well-veined biceps, is put through the paces of the midlife-crisis action thriller. Minions are slaughtered. Cellphones are dialed. Interpol is invoked.The director, Pierre Morel, is not too bad at this sort of thing, having directed Liam Neeson in the first “Taken” movie, a touchstone of modern angry-dad cinema, and John Travolta in “To Paris With Love.” He runs away pretty quickly from the topical pretensions of the script (written by Don MacPherson, Pete Travis and Mr. Penn and based on a Jean-Patrick Manchette novel), and concentrates on set pieces — chases, shootouts, a climactic showdown at a bullfighting ring — that are effective without being all that original.Mr. Penn, aiming for weary, battered intensity, settles into a zone somewhere between fatigue and indigestion. Jim’s bouts of forgetfulness, blurred vision and vertigo — results of a career of international headbanging — are meant to add some vulnerability to the character but really add only a layer of contrivance to the plot, which runs out of steam long before the loose ends are tied up. Mr. Bardem at least seems to be having fun, playing a big, silly drunk scene and exiting the movie before things get completely stupid. The poor gunman has to stick around until the end. No wonder he’s jealous.“The Gunman” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Killing and cursing.",0,7926657.0,10664749.0,0

Those wonderful actors play David and Paige Walling (Mr. Laurie and Ms. Keener) and Terry and Cathy Ostroff (Mr. Platt and Ms. Janney), longtime neighbors and close friends living in West Orange, N.J.The bomb that detonates early in the movie is David’s impulsive affair with the Ostroffs’ predatory, bad-girl daughter, Nina (Leighton Meester of “Gossip Girl”), who is half his age when she returns from California after her nasty breakup with a creep. The Wallings’ daughter, Vanessa (Alia Shawkat), narrates the story in a tone of weary sarcasm. She and Nina were best friends until high school, when Nina turned into a snooty mean girl and rejected her.The hole at the movie’s center is the seemingly passionless affair through which David ambles like a sleepwalker, while Nina’s motives remain indecipherable. Although they profess their love, there is not a flicker of light in their eyes or a spark of chemistry between them. Nina is such a blank that she comes across as a beautiful, blasé sociopath.Ms. Janney’s nosy, meddlesome Cathy is the movie’s most fully developed character. The shambling, eccentric Terry is so lost in his world of gadgets that he reacts to the surrounding drama with a sheepish, good-natured shrug, as if none of it were his problem. Only near the end of the movie does Ms. Keener’s betrayed wife rouse herself out of a daze of wounded stupefaction to vent her rage by rampaging in her car over Christmas lawn decorations; even that burst of energy is too little, too late.“The Oranges” is the first American feature by Julian Farino, a British-born director who has worked on several HBO series.

Directed by Wuershan, a veteran of commercials who is making his feature debut, the film ricochets in a breakneck delirium from ham-fisted comedy to solemn revenge drama to antic martial-arts thriller, a crazy quilt of energy and style.Partly midwifed by the director-producer Doug Liman, the movie comprises three interlocking stories linked to a vice. Ignorance is represented by the hapless butcher (Liu Xiaoye), who foolishly covets a courtesan (Kitty Zhang, evincing Anita Mui poise). Vengeance is embodied in the thief (the Japanese actor-director Masanobu Ando), undercover as a chef and on a mission of payback for his father’s murder. Covering greed is the swordsman (Ashton Xu), who covets a mystical blade.

(Lego did not finance the film.) And this nimble, expertly paced family-friendly film by Daniel Junge and Kief Davidson dutifully covers the origins of the Lego company in Billund, Denmark, and its growth into a global toy brand rivaling Mattel and Hasbro. But it delves into other things: how engineers and psychologists have employed the pieces as tools, and the ways in which people have adopted Legos as a medium to realize their creative visions.Sure, there are celebrity endorsements — the pop singer Ed Sheeran; Trey Parker, a co-creator of “South Park”; and the N.B.A. player Dwight Howard testify to the value of building with Legos (and Jason Bateman narrates the film). But more interesting testimonials, to use fan parlance, come from AFOLs (Adult Fans of Lego) in LUGs (Lego User Groups), who assemble in the movie at conventions in Seattle and Chicago. We meet Adam Reed Tucker, an architect building miniature Lego skyscrapers; David Pagano, a New York filmmaker specializing in Lego stop-motion animation (“brickfilms”); and Nathan Sawaya, an artist whose show “The Art of the Brick” comes to Times Square in the course of filming.Most movingly, we learn how Dr. Daniel LeGoff, who treats autistic children in New Jersey, has used Legos in his practice, and how Adrian Pitt, a New York City child in speech and language therapy, has benefited from the plastic bricks. “A Lego Brickumentary” might be a resounding cheer for a brand, but it’s an eye-opener, too.",0,,,1

It’s a classic pop creation in that its hook — three teenage boys mysteriously acquire fantastic powers — seems fresh even if the whole thing feels inspired by someone’s Netflix queue: a revenge-of-the-outsider tale like Brian De Palma’s “Carrie”; the first-person perspective of “The Blair Witch Project” and “Cloverfield”; and average Joes turned super-Joes as in the television shows “Heroes” and “No Ordinary Family.”“Chronicle,” written by Max Landis and directed by Josh Trank, who together came up with the story, warms up slowly. (Mr. Landis, 26, is the son of the director John Landis, best known for horror films like “An American Werewolf in London”; Mr. Trank, also 26, has worked as a film editor, including on “Big Fan.”) It opens with Andrew (a very good Dane DeHaan), the only child of a raging alcoholic father (Michael Kelly) and a mother who’s dying at home (Bo Petersen), recording himself in his bedroom mirror with a digital camera. The mirror hangs on a door that’s shaking because dear old drunk dad likes to play the Big Bad Wolf.For reasons that are never satisfactorily articulated, Andrew has decided to record everything in his life, or at least the highlights. Banalities like bathroom visits and classroom lessons don’t make the final cut, but a party that his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) coaxes him into attending does. After the usual cacophony of beats and revelry, and the introduction of an obligatory female lust object, Casey (Ashley Hinshaw), the movie gets down to business. Along with a popular student, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), Max takes Andrew over to a large hole in the ground. My, what a big mouth it has. Laughing, dizzy from booze and high on youth, the boys enter the void, dropping down, down into the black.For a while the mysterious hole and its cave hold out the promise that “Chronicle” will be as creepy-freaky as “Carrie,” and that the filmmakers will mine the cavity’s depths for all its psycho-sexual terror instead of settling for a boy’s super-neato adventure. No such luck. Mr. Landis certainly is clever — the garrulous Matt, who looks and sounds as if he’s in college, name drops Schopenhauer, Jung and Plato — but these citations are largely self-aware icing on a genre cake. Early on Matt explains to Andrew, CliffsNotes style, Schopenhauer’s concept of will, vaguely paving the way for the actions and themes to come. The hole, the boys soon discover, has left them with extraordinary powers, including telekinesis, gifts that eventually lead to a battle between untamed will and choice.Matt and Steve embrace their new powers with giddy enthusiasm and while Andrew initially seems just as blissed out, he soon goes dark and then darker. From the start there’s an undertow of cruelty to the teenagers’ high jinks as they learn what they can do, as when they levitate a stuffed animal to frighten a child. Mr. Trank brings a light touch to these self-discovery scenes — the three are flexing fast-evolving muscles — as well as a creeping sense of menace.In this respect, Mr. DeHaan, whose vulnerability and physical awkwardness here can evoke the young Leonardo DiCaprio in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape,” is invaluable. Mr. Russell and Mr. Jordan are as likable as their characters, but it’s Mr. DeHaan who pulls you uneasily in.Mr. Trank’s shrewdest move is to give “Chronicle” visual polish. (That and the neat trick of making South Africa pass for Seattle.) The movie is primarily seen through Andrew’s eyes, or rather his cameras, which gives the opening section a grubby, smeary, consumer-level digital video look. After he loses his original camera, though, and somehow obtains a better one, improving the image quality (and how! the movie was shot with an Alexa, which can start at $60,000), he increasingly uses his telekinetic powers to operate his new toy. The superhero stuff is all fine and good enough, but it’s this vision of a lonely boy with his swooping, dipping, flying Tinker Bell of a camera that truly lifts the movie.“Chronicle” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Years ago, Buddy promised to build a ranch for his little brother, Jakey (Anton Yelchin), whose life took a different turn: He moved to New York, became a professional violinist and acquired an Italian girlfriend. When Jakey comes home to visit, a deeply silly drama of corrupted innocence ensues.Hench, Buddy and Jakey get entangled in a wonkily plotted story punctuated with the visual bombast of white horses and C.G.I. flames. Buddy and Jakey have the sort of brotherly bond that is anchored in endlessly mentioned pacts from childhood. Hench, accompanied by henchmen (or Henchmen?), is seen driving around in trucks in scenic long shots when he’s not persuading Buddy to commit violent acts, with Svengali-like success.ImageChris Marquette and Anton Yelchin in ""Broken Horses.""CreditReliance Entertainment/Vinod Chopra FilmsMr. Marquette gives his character the conventional treatment: slavish loyalty, wide eyes, childlike verbal miscues and selective self-possession. Mr. Yelchin’s character looks somewhat at a loss about what goes on here, and who can blame him, especially when he visits the former music teacher who has lost his legs in a run-in with the bad guys and now lives in a house warmed by a flaming barrel.Mr. Chopra says his well-liked fraternal drama “Parinda” inspired this film, but something happened on the way to “Broken Horses,” which makes a risibly sentimental refrain of Buddy’s expression of excitement: “I’ll go bananas.

In protest, Mr. Schrader; his stars Nicolas Cage and Anton Yelchin; and one of his executive producers, the filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, have appeared online in T-shirts emblazoned with the text of a nondisparagement clause.Nevertheless, what emerges in “Dying of the Light” is an uncommonly contemplative cat-and-mouse thriller: a meditation on mortality and fanaticism, themes familiar to Mr. Schrader, whose explorations of the subjects include his work as the screenwriter of “Taxi Driver” and as the director of “Hardcore” and “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.”Mr. Cage plays Evan Lake, a three-decade C.I.A. operative who delivers rallying talks to recruits, telling them that the organization didn’t outlive its usefulness when the Berlin Wall fell. Lake yearns to catch Muhammad Banir (Alexander Karim), a terrorist the agency says is dead and won’t investigate, even when evidence suggests otherwise. Lake, who can’t abide a murderer going free, has started to experience symptoms of frontotemporal dementia.Banir, who suffers from a hereditary blood disease, is portrayed as Lake’s mirror image: Each man is a dying true believer sidelined in a changing world. (In the funniest scene, Lake has an outburst when told he can’t smoke in a restaurant in Romania.) Because Lake’s condition causes inappropriate reactions and unreliable perception, his foul-mouthed criticism of what he sees as botched C.I.A. operations is open to interpretation.Even without an intellectual dimension, “Dying of the Light” would make a decent espionage picture, a companion to the similarly character-driven “A Most Wanted Man.” The notion of an undercover agent with an untrustworthy mind is a great gimmick — and on a commercial level, “Dying of the Light” sometimes plays as just another high-concept vehicle for a comically overacting Mr. Cage. But Mr. Schrader’s vision is strong enough to rage against the hackier calculations.“Dying of the Light” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,"There’s a New Sheriff in Town, and He’s a Rootin’-Tootin’ Reptile","Feature animation currently finds itself in a golden age of mediocrity, with sensationally inventive technical means tethered, more often than not, to drab and cynical imaginative ends. The perennial Pixar exception tends to prove a dreary rule: as animated movies claim an ever bigger share of money and attention — drawing cross-generational, demographically diverse audiences more readily than most other films — they rely more and more on manic, synthetic formulas.And so, a half-dozen times a year, parents and children line up for overscaled, noisy genre pastiches crammed with yammering movie-star voice work, eye-straining action sequences and tacked-on sermons about the importance of being yourself, following your dream or sticking by your friends and family. Even at their best (again noting the Pixar exception), these movies are like theme-park rides and other big-ticket corporate amusements — thrilling while they last and then quickly forgotten.All of the above should apply to “Rango,” a tongue-in-cheek western (a lizard’s tongue, at that) directed by Gore Verbinski, who is best known for helping to turn a theme-park ride (Disney World’s “Pirates of the Caribbean”) into a dizzyingly successful movie franchise. But the odd thing about “Rango” is that unlike so many of its peers, it is odd. In spite of a profile that should place it alongside “Megamind” and “Despicable Me” and the long list of other overblown, have-fun-or-else cartoons, this rambling, anarchic tale is gratifyingly fresh and eccentric. Much of the time you don’t quite know where it is going, which is high praise indeed given the slick predictability that governs most other entertainments of its kind.Perhaps this should not be too surprising, since Mr. Verbinski, especially in the first installment of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series, showed a distinctive visual style and a genuinely off-beat sensibility. He was helped immeasurably, in all of the “Pirates” pictures, by the decorative whimsy of Mark McCreery (the production designer here) and by the uninhibited goofiness of Johnny Depp, who turned Jack Sparrow into a new pop-culture archetype. Both Mr. McCreery and Mr. Depp are crucial to the look and rhythm of “Rango,” keeping it vigorously strange almost until the end, when the movie decides to go for the safe, commercial action-extravaganza wrap-up.But the craziness of the journey makes that familiar destination worth it. We first encounter Mr. Depp’s character, a domesticated lizard with a Hawaiian shirt and an active imagination, in the terrarium tank he shares with a broken doll torso and a wind-up plastic fish. This minimal world is a stage for him, and he struts about on it like a scaly provincial trouper, acting out dramatic scenarios and scenes from Shakespeare to dispel the boredom of benign captivity. The blank, abstract space this creature inhabits calls our attention to the fanciful nature of the movie itself, as it begins to conjure an antic, improbable world out of nothing.Or, rather, out of images and ideas that have been floating around in the collective dream life for as long as most of us can remember. Mr. Verbinski and his colleagues (John Logan wrote the script, and James Ward Byrkit shares story credit) rummage through a grab bag of allusions and homages, many of which seem inspired more by genuine fandom than by the impulse to be clever. There is an early, blink-and-you-miss-it nod to the memory of Hunter S. Thompson, who is a personal touchstone for Mr. Depp and is also connected to the iconography of the West that “Rango” sets out to explore. That includes not only the expected tumbleweeds and cactuses and dusty rock formations, but also a hallucinatory desert tradition encompassing Carlos Castaneda and Wile E. Coyote.Prodded on his quest by a visionary armadillo (voiced by Alfred Molina) and accompanied by the corridos of a quartet of fatalistic singing owls, our reptilian hero drags himself to the desolate town of Dirt, a bleak, bone-dry place that is nonetheless swimming in cinematic associations. As Hans Zimmer’s score chews up great mouthfuls of Ennio Morricone-style spaghetti, the town’s varmint population evokes movies ranging from the westerns of John Ford to “Chinatown” and “The Big Sleep.”I know, it sounds annoyingly, coyly referential — something like a lizard-cowboy “Shrek” — but the spirit is closer to those old Bugs Bunny cartoons in which Bugs would cross paths with real movie stars or perform Wagnerian opera. In other words, it is not self-conscious knowingness that drives “Rango” but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers’ heads over the years. Nor are they merely recycling. The desert environment has a washed-out, eerie appearance entirely unlike the plasticized landscapes of most animation — the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, who shot the American West for Joel and Ethan Coen in “No Country for Old Men” and “True Grit,” is credited as a visual consultant — and the critters who inhabit it are arrestingly, grotesquely hairy, slimy and scaly.In addition to the reptile there are an impressive assortment of birds, bugs, rodents and less identifiable species that collectively enact a story of greed, treachery and bravery as old as the West itself. Our lizard, a stranger in town, takes on the name Rango and finds himself appointed sheriff, and also romantically drawn to a plucky frontier gal named Beans (Isla Fisher). (Abigail Breslin, Ray Winstone and Harry Dean Stanton are among the other notable voices of Dirt.) The town is drying up, and the mayor (Ned Beatty) may not have the best interests of the citizens at heart.A whole lot happens, culminating in a showdown with a villainous rattlesnake (Bill Nighy) and including a voice cameo that I won’t spoil, though the end credits might. Those interested in narrative coherence may feel a bit let down at the end; I confess I wanted a tighter gathering of loose ends, and a more thorough explanation of the politics of water and real estate in the fast-changing American West.But that’s what real westerns are about. “Rango,” which may take place entirely within its hero’s head — that kind of ambiguity worked in “Inception” and “Black Swan,” so why not here? — is about the appetite for myths and stories, whether or not they make sense. It is about the worlds we dream inside our fishbowls, helped by the weird reflections on the walls.“Rango” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There’s rude talk, smoking and killing. It is a western, after all.RANGOOpens on Friday  nationwide.Directed by Gore Verbinski;  written by John Logan, based on a story by Mr. Logan, Mr. Verbinski and  James Ward Byrkit; feature animation by Industrial Light and Magic;  edited by Craig Wood; music by Hans Zimmer; production design by Mark McCreery; produced by Mr. Verbinski, Graham King and John B.

It’s more like a political campaign ad disguised as a public service announcement, and the message is: Get rid of the U.C.I.’s current leaders. That’s the Union Cycliste Internationale, the organization that its detractors can’t just walk away from, because it has the power to award Olympic qualification points.Kathryn Bertine’s talking heads, many of them gifted athletes who have to work full-time civilian jobs to pay the mortgage, have a rock-solid argument. Men’s cycling offers ridiculously higher prize money and gets a lot more attention than women’s. A number of women say they could die happy if they just had the chance to do the Tour de France. But the message is repeated ad infinitum; this documentary is painfully long for a project of this kind.Although the film’s subtitle is “The Passion, Pitfalls & Power of Women’s Professional Cycling,” the closest Ms. Bertine, a former ESPN columnist, comes to conveying that passion is near the end, when little girls just beginning to race talk about their love for the sport.

877,2012-02-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,By A.&#160;O. SCOTT,"A Video From Tehran: It’s Not What It Isn’t, but What It Is","The title “This Is Not a Film” nods in the direction of René Magritte’s famous painting of a pipe, but at least at first glance, this new 75-minute work of cinema by Jafar Panahi has little in common with any sly Surrealist prank.This video essay was recorded in Tehran last year, as Mr. Panahi, one of the leading Iranian filmmakers of the past decade, was under a legal assault from his government that included the confiscation of his passport, the threat of a long prison sentence and an even longer ban on making movies.Careful to obey the letter of that injunction — and thus exposing the preposterousness as well as the meanness of its spirit — Mr. Panahi did not write a screenplay or wield a full-size camera. A colleague, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb (credited as co-director), comes to his apartment to shoot, and Mr. Panahi restricts his activities to talking, recording with his iPhone, commenting on some of his earlier films and reading aloud from existing scripts. So if this is not a film, it is, among other things, a statement of creative resistance in the face of tyranny and a document of intellectual freedom under political duress.But that “among other things” brings us, in a way, back to Magritte, because while “This Is Not a Film” bristles with a topical, real-world urgency pointedly excluded from the Surrealist project, it is also a provocative, radical and at times surprisingly playful meditation on the nature of representation. Using modest, ready-to-hand techniques and a format that seems to emphasize the most banal, literal-minded, artless aspects of picture taking, Mr. Panahi has constructed a subtle, strange and haunting work of art.Don’t tell the Iranian authorities, though by now they should be familiar with movies that explore the enigmatic qualities of everyday life while at the same time inviting ruminations on the ambiguities of cinema itself. In the 1990s and the early years of this century Iranian filmmakers like Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Abbas Kiarostami, Mr. Panahi’s erstwhile mentor, blended social inquiry with formal self-consciousness in a series of experiments that amounted to the invention of a new style.The international eminence of Iranian cinema — the most recent manifestation of which is the Oscar given to Asghar Farhadi last Sunday for “A Separation” — is in large measure a recognition of this novel and fruitful way of mixing documentary, social realism and poetic insight.Mr. Kiarostami’s “Life and Nothing More,” Mr. Makhmalbaf’s “Moment of Innocence” and “The Apple” by his daughter Samira are in part about how the movie camera can estrange and intensify the reality it discloses to the viewer. Actual events in the world — the aftermath of an earthquake in a rural village, a violent encounter between a policeman and a student radical, a bizarre episode of family dysfunction — are not simply documented in these films but are also re-enacted, interpreted and argued about as the cameras roll. Cinema is both a transparent lens and a distorting mirror, and using it as a tool to examine the facts of human existence makes it impossible to take any of those facts for granted.There is a philosophical headiness to these recursive, argumentative movies, an intellectual high that accompanies and sometimes magnifies their emotional impact. Though “A Separation” is not as formally self-conscious, turning as it does on competing views and after-the-fact reconstructions of a contested event, it works in a similar vein.And so do Mr. Panahi’s earlier films, notably “The Circle,” “Crimson Gold” and “Offside,” which add a vigorous dose of pointed and passionate social criticism. His contribution to Iranian cinema in the past decade has been to bring matters of class, gender and social alienation into the foreground with tact as well as with anger.In the wake of the contested elections of 2009 and their bloody aftermath, it is perhaps not surprising that the forces of reaction singled out Mr. Panahi for punishment, even though (or perhaps just because) they knew that persecuting him would raise an international outcry. “This Is Not a Film,” smuggled out of Iran last year to be shown at Cannes and other international festivals, has done important work in keeping the rest of the world aware of the Iranian situation.But if that were the primary reason to see it, Mr. Panahi’s unclassifiable intervention in the world’s collective imaginative life would be equivalent to a committee-written letter to The New York Review of Books. It is so much more than that, so much more than a simple act of protest against oppression, partly because it looks like quite a bit less.What do you see? A middle-aged man puttering around a spacious, elegant apartment that might be the home of a cosmopolitan, middle-class intellectual anywhere in the world, full of books, art, high-end electronics and other nice things.The man, whose family is visiting relatives, chats with his lawyer on the phone, tends to his daughter’s pet iguana and watches bits of some of the movies he made back when he was permitted to practice his profession. He sometimes lets his anxiety and fatigue show, but mostly he seems to regard his situation with stoicism and a measure of amusement. He is clearly more accustomed to observing and reflecting on the actions of others than to being the center of the action.And so he does both, turning a highly personal video diary into a charged and expansive historical narrative. There is no plot (it’s not a film, after all), but there is nonetheless an amazing twist at the end, followed by a quiet tremor of awe.How did Mr. Panahi do this? I’m at a bit of a loss to explain, to tell you the truth, since my job is to review movies, and this, obviously, is something different: a masterpiece in a form that does not yet exist.",1,,,0

Hitched to the research of the psychology professor Richard Davidson (who is featured), the film switches between a few haunted Iraq war veterans and a fearful foster child with lots of energy. It’s patient and free of shame. But as it briskly shows their progress, broken up by dippy animations of neuron storms, it feels like a demonstration of a point.The techniques shown include breathing and awareness exercises that help stifle the horrific memories on permanent loop that torment the veterans. For the remarkably cooperative boy, what helps is close immediate attention by special teachers to the causes and effects of his ups, downs and jitters. There is always something miraculous in how such unglamorous efforts can combat something as awful as war trauma or as slippery as unyielding anxiety, and Ms. Ambo’s film captures a bit of that.Larger ideas of a mind-body connection, and mentions of brain research, are not treated in an inspiring or deeply informative way. Ms. Ambo communicates the notion of compassion and calm as something teachable, but perhaps feeling already convinced, she’s less ambitious as a filmmaker about taking her subject and her portraits to another level.",0,157007.0,,0

Fortunately for the filmmakers, most of the comedians interviewed here — Jerry Stiller, Jackie Mason, Jerry Lewis and many other (mostly male) voices — provide lighthearted remembrances to elevate this poorly executed documentary.The comedians, and viewers, deserve better than Robert Klein’s hokey narration (written by Lawrence Richards) with kickers like “triple oy vey”; amateurish editing and graphics; and cheesy re-enactments. Those elements distract from the things that work: clips from songs and movies (“The Bellboy,” “History of the World: Part I”); vintage photos and videos of New York City, Yiddish theater and vaudeville acts; and insights from historians.In exploring the Jewish style of self-deprecating survival comedy, the ability to find a joke in even the darkest times of despair, the film makes a connection to the language and timing of modern humor. The training in the Catskills paid mainstream dividends for busboys and tummlers (who amused hotel guests with shtick) like Danny Kaye and Sid Caesar. Yet the filmmakers fail to show the broader impact that these comics still have on pop culture.There is a brief section about Hugh Hefner’s role in helping comics like Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory get a foothold. They trafficked in social and political issues, like civil rights, but they didn’t appeal to the Catskill guests and comedians who steered clear of off-color jokes. It’s interesting that their rise (and the rise of the desegregated Playboy clubs) came around the time of the borscht belt’s decline. It’s a cultural shift that would have been worth a deeper examination.",0,,,0

While a lot could be said about each, and about food and culture generally, this dully structured film makes its points early and often, treading water before a purposely delayed big finish.The film dwells on why the hard workers behind the restaurants keep returning to the kitchen. A pillar of its community, Breitbach’s amounts to a public duty proudly embraced by its family, whose German roots date to the founding of its hometown. La Cocina de Gabby, the Tucson establishment, is an attempt at self-sufficiency by the Martinez couple, who are raising a daughter and fending off foreclosure. Alinea is accepted as an artistic endeavor, with Mr. Achatz its solipsistic innovator (ripe for a Ben Stiller parody).Mr. Levy’s film saves Mr. Achatz’s 2007 cancer diagnosis and Breitbach’s own tragedy for last, betraying the simplicity of its approach. But sometimes a conventional documentary says more through how it treats its subjects. The camera lingers on the Martinezes shedding tears at home, as if we were entitled to their hardship, but we see Mr. Achatz’s wife and children only well after his star spotlight has been established.

Perhaps because they have chosen to be there,  they don’t have the look of sullen resentment and cultivated boredom that glazes the faces of the high school students glimpsed now and again. Instead these latter-day bards gaze at the man who has come to say something to them about art and maybe life. Instead he holds up an apple and talks about seeing.The importance of seeing, seeing the world deeply, is at the heart of this quietly devastating, humanistic work from the South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong. Throughout the story, the teacher, a bespectacled man with an easy manner, will guide the students as each struggles to write a single poem, searching memories and emotions for inspiration. “Up till now, you haven’t seen an apple for real,” he says in that first class, as the film cuts to a student, Mija  (Yun Jung-hee),  sliding into a seat. “To really know what an apple is, to be interested in it, to understand it,” he adds, “that is really seeing it.” From the way the camera settles on Mija it’s evident that he could substitute the word apple for woman — or life.For Mija, a 66-year-old raising her only grandson, Wook (Lee David), in a cramped, cluttered apartment in an unnamed city, the pursuit of poetry becomes a pastime and then a passion and finally a means of transcendence. At first, though, it’s a pleasant distraction from an otherwise mundane existence, if also a way to exercise a mind that, as a doctor tells Mija early on, has begun to slip slowly away from her. Out of fear or confusion, she keeps the diagnosis to herself and almost from herself, telling neither Wook nor his mother, who lives in another city. Instead she dons the poet’s cap. “I do have a poet’s vein,” she says, chattering into her cellphone. “I do like flowers and say odd things.”She seems so unremarkable, this woman with her white hats, tidily arranged scarves and vanity. But like this subtle, transfixing film, she draws you in. Crucial in this respect is Ms. Yun’s performance, a tour de force of emotional complexity that builds through restraint and, like Mr. Lee’s unadorned visual style, earns rather than demands your attention. (His earlier features include “Secret Sunshine.”) The shabby rooms and ordinary streets in “Poetry” are shown without fanfare, more like statements of facts than pieces of an evolving narrative. Yet it’s the prosaic quality of this world, its ordinariness, that makes the story’s shocks reverberate so forcefully, beginning with the revelation that Wook and five friends, all boys, have been implicated in the death of a classmate, a girl first seen floating face down in a river in the opening scene.There’s a mesmerizing quality to that sequence, which begins with an image of rushing water, partly because — like the young child on the riverbank whose viewpoint you share — you initially can’t make out what it is that you’re looking at until the body floats  into the frame in close-up. The corpse belongs to a teenage girl who accused  some classmates of having serially raped her. On the most brutal level, her body introduces a mystery. Yet there’s more to the opening, including the children clustered on the riverbank, ominously doubled by the teenagers who  helped put that body in the water and whose indifference suggests that, for them, this death wasn’t cataclysmic, just play that got out of hand.This cruelty doesn’t exist in isolation, as becomes obvious  when the father of one of the other accused rapists contacts Mija and sweeps her off to an afternoon meeting at a restaurant. Together, he and four other fathers have decided — with the school’s blessing — to give the dead girl’s mother a large sum of cash, a bribe for her silence. What’s done is done, one man more or less says, as another pours the beer. (“Ladies first,” he says, offering Mija a glass.) “Although I feel sorry for the dead girl,” a father says, “now’s the time for us to worry about our own boys.” Her face empty, Mija sits wordlessly. And then she drifts outside, opens her little notebook and begins writing: “Blood ... a flower as red as blood.”Out of pain, Mija finds a way to see, really see the world, with its flowers, rustling trees, laughing people and cruelties, and in doing so turns reality into art, tragedy into the sublime. It’s an extraordinary transformation, one that emerges through seemingly unconnected narrative fragments, tenderly observed moments and a formal rigor that might go unnoticed. Yet everything pieces together in this heartbreaking film — motifs and actions in the opening are mirrored in the last scenes — including flowers, those that bewitch Mija outside the restaurant and those in a vase at the dead girl’s house. The river that flows in the opening shot streams through the last image too, less a circle than a continuum.At one point, Mija asks her poetry teacher with almost comic innocence, “When does a ‘poetic inspiration’ come?” It doesn’t, he replies, you must beg for it. “Where must I go?” she persists. He says that she must wander around, seek it out, but that it’s there, right where she stands. In truth, there is poetry everywhere, including in those who pass through her life, at times invisibly, like the handicapped retiree (Kim Hira) she cares for part time, a husk of a man whom she will at last also see clearly. The question that she doesn’t ask is the why of art. She doesn’t have to because the film — itself an example of how art allows us to rise out of ourselves to feel for another through imaginative sympathy — answers that question beautifully.PoetryOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Lee Chang-dong; director of photography, Kim Hyung-seok; edited by Kim Hyun; production design by Sihn Jeom-hui; produced by Lee Joon-dong; released by Kino International.

The production, started in early 2013, was thrown into disarray when its original director, the visionary Lynne Ramsay, left mere days into shooting. At least two key cast and crew members followed her. In addition, the movie’s original distributor, Relativity Media, lost the rights to the picture in a bankruptcy proceeding. The final film was released by the Weinstein Company, without screenings for reviewers.Under such circumstances one hopes for, if not a lost masterpiece, then something quirky and entertaining. The tale of a frontier wife, Jane (Natalie Portman), in the New Mexico Territory, enlisting a former lover (Joel Edgerton) to defend home and hearth after her husband has been laid low did not seem to be an unreasonable scenario. I was hoping for something along the lines of a gender-reversed “Shane,” with Noah Emmerich (he plays the husband) in the Jean Arthur role. No such luck.Instead, Mr. O’Connor presides over a somber slog, full of gorgeous vistas nicely captured by the cinematographer Mandy Walker. The strife-filled story isn’t made more engaging through a lumbering structure made up of flashbacks. Ewan McGregor’s villain, leader of a gang called the Bishop Boys, sports jet-black-dyed hair and a nearly twirlable matching mustache, while his cohort has sufficient face tattoos and scarification marks that I began thinking of them as the Bushwick Boys.Whatever feminist angle the film might have once aspired to is lost in its listless shuffle. It’s probably no coincidence, then, that the viewer can’t tell whether the movie’s reluctance to serve up a rousing climax is the result of poor planning, or some kind of declaration of principles.“Jane Got a Gun” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence and some language.

At 66, with a snowy mane and an imperial demeanor, Mr. Gere now exerts the magnetism of a swashbuckling lion in winter.With the pressure off to play swoon-worthy heartthrobs, he is free to explore the depths of his talent by inhabiting roles like the homeless man in the recent “Time Out of Mind” and a creepy megalomaniacal, morphine-addicted philanthropist known as the King of Philadelphia in his new film, “The Benefactor.”His character, Francis L. Watts, a.k.a. Franny, is a vainglorious manipulator of other people accustomed to getting his way, often by playing God. So long as the camera is studying Franny maniacally bestowing his largess or throwing temper tantrums, “The Benefactor” is mesmerizing. But Mr. Gere’s flamboyant performance is the sole raison d’être for this melodrama, written and directed by Andrew Renzi. Its other elements are given short shrift.Franny doesn’t make friends; he buys them. When in a jovial mood, he is charming, if overbearing. But when his will is thwarted, he can turn into a scary monster hurling accusations and threats like thunderbolts. In “The Benefactor,” he runs the gamut from benevolent monarch to snarling pit bull, sometimes in a matter of seconds.The movie begins several years earlier with a fatal accident. A euphoric Franny, high on pot in the back seat of a car driven by his best friend, Bobby (Dylan Baker), spontaneously embraces Bobby from behind. At the same instant, the car is smashed by an oncoming vehicle. Bobby and his wife, Mia (Cheryl Hines), are killed. Franny survives, but with serious injuries and a crushing burden of guilt.The couple leave behind a daughter, Olivia (Dakota Fanning), a.k.a. Poodles, whom Franny adores. When Olivia marries Luke (Theo James), a handsome young doctor, and becomes pregnant, Franny impulsively buys them the magnificent country house in which she grew up. He also insists on paying off Luke’s six-figure college loans and makes him a board member of the children’s hospital he owns. That the underwritten Olivia barely exists leaves a hole in the film.Franny’s courtship of Luke, with its homoerotic subtext, bears an uncomfortably close resemblance to John du Pont’s patronage of the Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz, played by Channing Tatum in “Foxcatcher.” In the most disturbing scene, Franny pressures Luke to take Ecstasy, and they go on a daredevil joy ride. The potential for evil, often tinged with twisted sexual menace, has always lurked in Mr. Gere’s eyes, which when narrowed can suggest the diabolical mind of torturer. And Mr. Gere milks the subtext of this mentor-protégé connection for all its worth.At its midpoint, “The Benefactor” shifts gears, and a study of a control freak becomes a nightmarish movie about addiction. Unable to refill his prescription for morphine, Franny, in the throes of withdrawal, becomes a desperate, pitiable wreck. The inability of a man as powerful and well connected as Franny to fulfill his craving is implausible, and “The Benefactor” becomes a heavy-handed, crazily histrionic mess.“The Benefactor” is not rated.

Set out West, amid mannered weirdos and saturated colors, this second feature from Ward Roberts stages beatdowns, chase scenes and face-offs, all arising out of a drug debt owed to a monstrous bar owner named Buzz.Living in the middle of nowhere, Ella (Amber Benson, a “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” veteran) and her baby fall into peril when her husband, a meth-head and a meathead, fails to repay Buzz (Jeremiah Birkett). The stoic, eyepatched Jack (Aaron Gaffey) steps in with his American Indian-garbed pal, Mo (Devin Barry). Mayhem, or a quirky and music-fueled approximation thereof, ensues.Mr. Roberts has a showman’s weakness for announcing every visual setup or joke, whether inventive or not. We are never in doubt when we’re supposed to crow at some cannibalism, chortle over Buzz’s nerdy factotum or boo a hissing thug named Mr. Lizard. Some goofy and deadpan routines keep the film from becoming meanspirited, but the cruelty and bombast of Mr. Birkett’s Buzz tend to sour the mood.Finally the notion of “Dust Up” as a “grind-house” flick, as advertised, recalls the bar scene in “Ghost World” when a ragtime guitar picker is succeeded by a headache-inducing band called Blues Hammer.",0,,,0

Michael Couto, Grant Holly",2002,5.3,106.0,,2017-11-02 04:18:14,STEPHEN HOLDEN,A Cold Mountain Village Where Heartbreak Is Everybody’s Business,"The small, hardy community in the Rocky Mountains that gives “Angels Crest” its name is a rough-hewn working-class town of grain elevators and meat-and-potatoes eateries where everyone knows everyone else’s business. Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekker), the film’s main character, is a 21-year-old father who works in an auto parts shop and is raising his 3-year-old son, Nate, singlehandedly. The child’s mother, Cindy (Lynn Collins), a bitter and promiscuous alcoholic much older than Ethan, keeps her distance.Tragedy strikes early, when Ethan packs Nate into his pickup truck and drives into the woods to hunt. After parking on the side of the road, he buckles his son into his child seat, turns up the heat and leaves Nate alone while he stalks deer. When Ethan returns, Nate has disappeared, and he panics. A frantic search ensues, with teams of men combing the woods. Even after the search is abandoned, Ethan continues looking for the boy, whom he eventually discovers frozen to death.“Angels Crest,” directed by Gaby Dellal, is a sustained howl of grief in which Ethan’s unassailable sorrow and guilt send an arrow into your heart. In these scenes the screenplay, adapted by Catherine Trieschmann from a novel by Leslie Schwartz, captures the same excruciating pain beyond words that Atom Egoyan distilled in his adaptation of “The Sweet Hereafter” by Russell Banks. That film, about a small town’s trauma after many of its children die in a school bus accident, had more concentrated grief than any film I can recall.But the other parts of “Angels Crest” mostly don’t fit. Although the movie captures the solidarity and the beauty and peril of a rustic mountain town whose residents are necessarily interdependent, its individual subplots don’t connect. Despite several solid performances, the characters are too hazily sketched and too loosely linked to form a meaningful chain.Ms. Collins as the absentee mother, who in a rage tries to run down Ethan in her car, is a self-pitying, one-dimensional nightmare. A story line involving Cindy’s relationship with her devout mother (Barbara Williams) tries and fails to humanize her. When Cindy snaps at her mother, “You have your god; I have mine,” a reference to booze, all you feel is disgust.Another subplot involving Ethan’s best friend, Rusty (Joseph Morgan), who was sleeping with Cindy when the tragedy occurred, is left undeveloped. A strand that follows Ethan’s friend Jane (Elizabeth McGovern), a lesbian waitress at the diner that is a kind of clearinghouse for the film’s characters, drifts aimlessly. Nate’s death makes Jane uncomfortably aware of her own troubled history as a parent. (Her grown son shows up with his pregnant girlfriend.) The incident also fortifies the bond between the diner’s proprietor, Angie (Mira Sorvino), another undeveloped character, and her young daughter.Most out of place is Jeremy Piven as Jack, a local district attorney, with his own tragic baggage that (frustratingly) is alluded to but never specified. Jack, who seeks to prosecute Ethan for criminally negligent homicide, methodically interviews the townspeople, whom he finds to be divided over Ethan’s culpability.All of this adds up to much ado about much less than meets the eye. Situations that could illuminate merely distract. And the abrupt, melodramatic conclusion feels unearned. Despite its earnest and frostbitten atmosphere, “Angels Crest” is a film of sadly missed opportunities.“Angels Crest” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and strong language.ANGELS CRESTOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Gaby Dellal; written by Catherine Trieschmann, based on the book by Leslie Schwartz; director of photography, David Johnson; edited by Mick Audsley and Giles Bury; music by Stephen Warbeck; production design by Louise Middleton; costumes by Christine Thomson; produced by Shirley Vercruysse and Leslie Cowan; released by Magnolia Pictures.

The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he’s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne — played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck — takes the lead on this enterprise. He’s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens (“critical damage” reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He’s also pretty much of a yawn.The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman’s (or Bruce’s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She’s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie’s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (“Gone Girl”), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work.As it is, the little bit of bat brooding in “Justice League” feels unmotivated and unearned, and lacks the shading of the character in the “Dark Knight” or even in the Lego movies. That’s too bad, and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But “Justice League” is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo, so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a machine man built from metal and serious attitude.The original Justice League of America (as it was called) first convened in 1960; the movie takes place in the present or at least a facsimile of the same. The world is in mourning for Superman, and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams, shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse, because of course it has to, leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers, who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story — one has roots in Atlantis, the other two are from hard-luck city — while flexing individual quirks and superpowers.“Justice League” settles into a groove once it finds its gang. As Bat-Bruce moodily pushes and prods and Wonder-Diana smiles and smirks, the newbies jockey for position. The Flash gets most of the best jokes, and Mr. Miller makes most of them work, largely in the role of in-house fanboy with a touch of the Cowardly Lion. It’s golly-gee stuff, but it’s also human and Mr. Miller keeps you hooked, as does Mr. Momoa (“Game of Thrones”), who supplely shifts between gravitas and comedy. When Aquaman chugs a bottle of booze before plunging into an angry sea, the movie hits the comic-book sweet spot between deadly seriousness and self-amused levity.Cyborg isn’t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who’s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can’t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn’t or can’t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.Mr. Snyder remains regrettably committed to a dark, desaturated palette that borders on the murky, and this movie’s chaotic, unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in “Justice League” lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike “Batman v Superman,” which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (“Justice League” clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the new movie shows a series that’s still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel’s, may be more enduring (and golden). It has justice, and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out, more breeziness, it is a start.",0,227032490.0,225546295.0,0

Robb Topolski, a former policeman, was a grandfather, software tester and barbershop-quartet baritone in Hillsboro, Ore., who found that Comcast, his Internet service provider, was interfering with his peer-to-peer sharing of public-domain material. The Associated Press picked up his story, and the Federal Communications Commission eventually issued a ruling against Comcast, since shot down by an appeals court.The film follows Mr. Topolski’s case to Washington, offering familiar but vivid glimpses into Beltway mores. (Ostensible civil servants, manipulated by lobbyists, often have greater loyalties to big-pocketed conglomerates than to the average citizen? Shocking.) But it’s noteworthy when nemeses like the Christian Coalition and the group Naral Pro-Choice America are on the same side of the Net-neutrality fence. The “punk” in the title refers to defiance and freethinkers like Janeane Garofalo and Henry Rollins, who provide eloquent digressions about the electronic dissemination and stifling of information and historical efforts to control such delivery systems.Idealists like Mr. Topolski are inspiring.

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘American Sniper,’ a Clint Eastwood Film With Bradley Cooper","As a young boy, which is to say before he grows up into a burly, bearded Bradley Cooper, Chris Kyle receives a lesson in life from his strict Texan father. The world, according to Dad, is divided into sheep, wolves and sheepdogs, those rare, righteous souls called to protect the innocent from the wicked. It’s a tough, stark view of the order of things, one that guides Chris in his subsequent career as a Navy SEAL sniper and one that has, with some modification, informed much of the work of Clint Eastwood, the director of “American Sniper.” Faithful in shape and spirit to the real Chris Kyle’s memoir, “American Sniper” also reaffirms Mr. Eastwood’s commitment to the themes of vengeance and justice in a fallen world. In the universe of his films — a universe where the existence of evil is a given — violence is a moral necessity, albeit one that often exacts a cost from those who must wield it in the service of good. The real-life merits of this idea are arguable, to say the least. As an ethical touchstone or a political principle, it certainly has its dangers. But a lot of great movies, including several of Mr. Eastwood’s, arise from the simple premise of a fight to the death between good guys and bad guys. “American Sniper” is not quite among them, but much of its considerable power derives from the clarity and sincerity of its bedrock convictions. Less a war movie than a western — the story of a lone gunslinger facing down his nemesis in a dusty, lawless place — it is blunt and effective, though also troubling.Mr. Cooper keeps a lid on his natural, mischievous charm without entirely suppressing it. His Chris Kyle is a loyal friend and a brave warrior, but Mr. Cooper and Mr. Eastwood, working from a script by Jason Hall, decline to make him a saint. Some of the liveliest and most memorable scenes in “American Sniper” are celebrations of the profane, aggressive humor and endless teasing that men in combat deploy to relieve the tension. Chris’s courtship and marriage — to Taya, played by Sienna Miller — are rendered a bit more stiffly, but the warmth and ease that are among Mr. Eastwood’s underappreciated virtues make their way into the movie’s brief forays into romance and domesticity.Mostly, though, we are in Iraq, where Chris Kyle served four tours of duty, racking up 160 confirmed kills. He approaches his work with steady nerves and a clear conscience, banishing the doubt and fatalism that afflict some of his comrades and buttressed by the unambiguous depravity of his enemies. These are people who use women and children as suicide bombers, who mutilate and torture anyone who opposes them, who ambush American Marines in the street. Giving them cover is Chris’s nemesis and sinister doppelgänger, a shadowy sharpshooter rumored to be a Syrian Olympic medalist. Remorse is out of the question, which is not to say that Chris doesn’t suffer. (Mr. Kyle’s death in 2013, at the hands of a disturbed fellow veteran, casts a somber shadow over the movie, though Mr. Eastwood avoids the obvious trap of using it as a foreshadowing device.) “American Sniper” doesn’t flinch from portraying the toll of his service on his psyche and his marriage, though it may tidy up the damage a bit too quickly and neatly. But this, too, is part of the film’s loyalty to its hero’s understanding of himself and his work. Or, you might say, its commitment to printing his legend. “Legend” is one of the nicknames Chris earns from his admiring fellow servicemen, who are in awe of his bravery and skill, and Mr. Eastwood engages in his share of mythmaking. This is less a matter of the way he tells the true story than in the way he edits the history in which it is embedded. Terrorist attacks on United States Embassies in 1998 inspired Chris to enlist, and his resolve is fortified when he sees the World Trade Center collapse on Sept. 11, 2001. In Iraq, his foes are identified only and repeatedly as Al Qaeda. The politics of the Iraq war are entirely absent, which is a political statement in its own right. And though George W. Bush’s name is never invoked, “American Sniper” can be seen as an expression of nostalgia for his Manichaean approach to foreign policy. It can equally — and this may amount to the same thing — be seen as upholding the Hollywood western tradition of turning complicated historical events and characters into fables and heroes. In other words, it’s only a movie.“American Sniper” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Intense combat and rough language.",0,274377268.0,350126372.0,0

And Ms. Heigl is Surly’s love interest, Andie, who has no remarkable characteristics of her own.Much more interesting are Surly’s mute best friend, Buddy, a dimwitted but loyal rat, and Precious, a kooky pug whose androgynous voice is not immediately recognizable as Maya Rudolph’s.Ms. Rudolph is by far the best thing in the film. Almost any scene with Buddy or Precious is funny and oddly emotional. Otherwise, “The Nut Job” features muddy-colored and often ugly animation, a plot that feels too stretched out and loaded with details to hold the attention of most children, and more flatulence jokes than anyone deserves.“The Nut Job” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild action and rude humor.",0,,64251538.0,0

Abandoned by their father, their mother lost to illness, they jumped trains as teenagers, costing Jerry Lee part of his leg. Now the hard-drinking Frank works at a factory in Reno, Nev., when he isn’t tending to the fragile, disheveled Jerry Lee, whose sole gift is for drawing: pictures of Willie Nelson and, mostly, voluptuous women. Frank tells him fantastical stories, flights of fancy (beautifully animated by Mike Smith) in which Jerry Lee is often the hero.Reality crashes on them again when a distraught Jerry Lee goes to Frank one winter night to confess to having accidentally killed a boy with his car. Off they flee, to Montana and then back to Reno, and then to the promised land of Elko, Nev., where Frank hopes to rekindle a relationship with an old flame (Dakota Fanning) and find relief from his hopelessly circumscribed life.If this sounds like an outlaw-country ballad, it should. “The Motel Life,” based on Willy Vlautin’s 2006 novel, vividly captures a milieu of seedy motel rooms, gambling dens, strip joints and garish sports bars. A weathered, sagacious Kris Kristofferson, as a used-car dealer and father figure to Frank, adds credibility. Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash’s “Girl From the North Country” completes the picture. The story may be slight, but the performances and ambience resonate.“The Motel Life” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual content, violence and drug references.",0,,,0

It just signed him to another three years. It’s not surprising: Mr. Perry has consistently shown Hollywood the magnitude of an underserved black female audience as no other director has, and now studios are struggling to keep up (for example the coming “Jumping the Broom”). The relationship between Mr. Lee and Mr. Perry is fascinatingly inverse: male-skewing perspective versus female; Northern sensibility versus Southern; jazz-rap orientation versus gospel-R&B. Fortunately it’s a big movie tent. But in box office Mr. Perry is winning.As he probably will with “Madea’s Big Happy Family,” his latest comedy-drama, which had its premiere in the same Good Friday berth that his “Why Did I Get Married Too?” enjoyed last year (though not to the same results). “Family” offers Mr. Perry’s signature ingredients: multiple subplots; a Southern setting; and broad comedy, florid melodrama and inspirational Christianity, tossed together with an almost slapdash élan. Not to mention the voluble Madea Simmons (Mr. Perry in drag), the gun-toting grandmother with a short fuse, dispensing old-school sagacity and no-nonsense tough love.This time the suds outweigh the humor, and to its credit Mr. Perry’s script doesn’t duck tragic consequences. Madea’s niece Shirley (Loretta Devine, underused) has cancer that has returned with a vengeance. Now Shirley wants to assemble her brood to break the news, but they’re such a fractious bunch, the task proves elusive. One daughter, Tammy (Natalie Desselle Reid), has two unruly children and resents her passive, blue-collar husband, Harold (Rodney Perry). She also bickers with her upper-crust sister, Kimberly (Shannon Kane), who callously berates her own husband, Calvin (Isaiah Mustafa, the winning star of those surreal Old Spice commercials).Shirley’s son, Byron ( the actor-rapper Bow Wow, a k a Shad Moss), just out of jail, is tempted to return to crime, thanks to two women who are hounding him for money: Renee (Lauren London), a selfish gold digger, and his abrasive ex, Sabrina (the singer Teyana Taylor), the mother of his infant son. Floating around with little to do are the Perry regulars David Mann and his wife, Tamela Mann, in their usual roles as Brown and Cora, and Cassi Davis, as the flinty, weed-smoking Aunt Bam, a Madea-like character in lower gear. As usual Mr. Perry offers a breakout performer, here the stunning Harlem native Ms. Taylor, hilariously grating but snapping with taut urban sass, a welcome hit of New York attitude.As Madea, Mr. Perry isn’t on-screen as prominently as in the previous franchise entry, “Madea Goes to Jail,” but when he is, it’s often to lecture those off their moral footing (and, in one scene, repeatedly to slap a back-talking young boy, to uneasy laughs). Mr. Perry, who has made 11 films in about six years, seems a tad weary of his matriarch. He doesn’t portray her nephew Brian, as he has in previous movies, though he has fun with Joe, Madea’s laconic, laid-back brother. But he hasn’t seen the last of his gray wig and floppy dresses; his new deal includes two more Madea expeditions. He’s also been cast as the hero in “I, Alex Cross,” the coming revival of a detective franchise that previously starred Morgan Freeman. Odds are he’s looking forward a lot more to that.“Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Big Happy Family” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned); drug use and mature themes.TYLER PERRY’S MADEA'S BIG HAPPY FAMILYOpened on Friday nationwide.Written and directed by Tyler Perry; director of photography, Toyomichi Kurita; edited by Maysie Hoy; music by  Aaron Zigman; production design by Ina Mayhew; costumes by Keith G.

So it’s all the more shocking that honest-to-goodness actors like Zachary Quinto and Rupert Friend have signed on to play the film’s two leads; maybe the director, Aleksander Bach, told them they could have a lifetime supply of their smoking-hot suits.But do we really need another movie about a man who’s a “perfect killing machine”? Or another evil corporation dreaming about cloning him into an army? Mr. Bach and his backers clearly believe that we do, going so far as to reboot the 2007 headache “Hitman” (based on the video game series with the same title) and adding more eye candy. But no amount of killer good looks can save a project with only an echo chamber of destruction where a story ought to be.Blasting through Singapore and Berlin, Agent 47 (Mr. Friend) and his nemesis, John Smith (Mr. Quinto), are aces at slaying but not so great at dying, popping up like Weebles after every encounter. This is easy for Smith, a genetically engineered assassin whose “subdermal titanium body armor” repels weapons, while Agent 47’s nonexistent emotions repulse any concern for his welfare. For that, he has a slinky handler, played by a Chinese actress whose stage name, Angelababy, should be bestowed by law on at least one newborn per year.But formula demands a (preferably beautiful) woman in peril, and so we have Katia (Hannah Ware), whom we meet holed up in a Berlin library. She’s looking for her father (poor Ciaran Hinds), Agent 47 is looking for her, and Smith is looking for both of them. One wants to kill her and the other wants to protect her, and kudos to you if you can work out which is which. (Maybe the movie’s continuity issues aren’t confined to Katia’s on-again, off-again lipstick.)A grab bag of random notions lifted primarily from the “Terminator” and “Matrix” universes, “Hitman” is a sexless, virtually bloodless chain of preposterous battles rendered in a two-dimensional gloss. But it will almost certainly be back: There are currently seven installments of the video game, with an eighth on the way. Though if they return with a steamy romance between Smith and 47, I might be forced to buy a ticket.“Hitman: Agent 47” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Enemies of the power elite can be arrested, tried on trumped-up charges and imprisoned in a system as labyrinthine and secretive as it was during the Soviet era. At least that is the perspective on Russian political power games expressed in “Khodorkovsky,” the German filmmaker Cyril Tuschi’s sympathetic documentary portrait of the persecuted Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who ran afoul of the former Russian president Vladimir V. Putin, who is now prime minister.That country’s unregulated cowboy capitalism had few rules after the fall of Communism. And in a climate rife with corruption, foul play of all kinds is still commonplace. Top leaders operate above the law and can step in at any moment and destroy their enemies.In October 2003 hooded security forces arrested Mr. Khodorkovsky on a plane, after which he was tried for fraud and tax evasion and sentenced to eight years in a Siberian prison. In late 2010, after a second trial in which he was accused of money laundering and the theft of 350 million tons of oil, he was sentenced to six more years.Mr. Tuschi visited the Siberian town near the Chinese border where Mr. Khodorkovsky was incarcerated, but was forbidden access to the prison. He did manage to interview him briefly through a glass cage during the second trial. Mr. Khodorkovsky has since been moved to a labor camp near the Finnish border.Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Tuschi exchanged letters, excerpts from which are read by the actor Harvey Friedman.The prisoner rather eloquently portrays himself as a victim of human rights abuse. His oldest son, Pavel, says in the film that he is afraid to return to Russia from the United States as long as his father is in jail.The major reason for his persecution, Mr. Khodorkovsky asserts, was his support of the political opposition after promising Mr. Putin that he would stay out of politics. But the movie strongly implies that their feud was also a macho cockfight that began at a high-level meeting at which he offended Mr. Putin by bringing up corruption in the Kremlin. The Russian leader decided to put Mr. Khodorkovsky in his place once and for all and had the power to do it.The visually snazzy film has stark, ominous, mostly black-and-white computer-animated sequences depicting Mr. Khodorkovsky’s initial arrest. One animated bit shows him swimming in a pool of gleaming gold coins. Among the film’s many talking heads, none directly represent the Russian political powers that be.Not long ago Mr. Khodorkovsky, 48, was the wealthiest among a new breed of oligarchs, many of whom made their fortunes when the Kremlin sold off its assets to favored businessmen after the fall of Communism.KhodorkovskyOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Cyril Tuschi; narrated by Jean-Marc Barr and Harvey Friedman; director of photography, Mr. Tuschi; edited by Claudia Simonesci, Salome Machaidze and Mr. Tuschi; music by Arvo Pärt; released by Kino Lorber Films. At the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. In English, Russian and German, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes. This film is not rated.Mr. Khodorkovsky studied chemistry, then went into business, and in 1988 he founded Russia’s first private bank. He seized the opportunity to purchase Yukos, the state-run oil company, at the bargain price of $300 million, according to the movie. Boris N. Yeltsin, who was then the president of Russia, believed that these assets, which no one in the country could afford to buy at market value, must remain in Russian hands. Several months later Yukos was worth $6 billion. Virtually overnight a new handpicked Russian upper class came into existence.Mr. Khodorkovsky was never a typical high-living oligarch, flaunting stretch limousines, beautiful women and palatial extravagance. He lived well but below his means in a luxurious compound outside Moscow with his top executives. Nor, Mr. Khodorkovsky says, did he entertain personal political ambitions. By several accounts, he learned from experience to be an enlightened capitalist and he donated a great deal of money to education.Early in his career, according to the movie, he indulged in the corruption that was endemic to Russian business and politics. But soon after assuming control of Yukos, and traveling abroad extensively, he realized that transparency was good for business, especially when dealing with corporations outside Russia.A tantalizing question that the director asks several commentators is why Mr. Khodorkovsky chose to remain in Russia while most top executives at Yukos fled.There is speculation that he hopes to re-emerge as a martyred national hero after serving his time. But to the young Russians interviewed in the film he is regarded as a criminal who stole from the nation.",1,14900.0,,0

Focusing on Lukas (Marius Jampolskis), an unlikable, emotionally withdrawn scientist who discards all professional ethics the instant an attractive woman sheds her clothing, this Lithuanian love story from Kristina Buozyte offers a discomfiting blend of visual ecstasy and narrative sterility.To further a research project that’s never fully explained, Lukas passes his days immersed in a sensory-deprivation tank (echoes of “Altered States”), his brain electronically linked with that of an anonymous coma patient. His task is to rake around in her unconscious and report his experiences; instead, he and his fantasy woman, Aurora (Jurga Jutaite), have sex — lots and lots of sex. On golden sands and sun-streaked floors, on a picnic table and amid the sweatless writhings of an airbrushed orgy, the wordless pair go at it like post-prom teenagers.Toggling between clinical laboratory and sensual dream land, “Waves” exerts a primal pull, its milky blue cinematography (by Feliksas Abrukauskas) and druggy soundtrack infinitely more expressive than its male lead. As Lukas becomes increasingly obsessed with hunting down the woman in his visions, the film wonders what we will risk to get lost in lust. With Aurora struggling for sensation and Lukas beginning to feel too much, we’re left with a single question: Who is awakening whom?",0,,,0

Using that quality to powerful effect, the director, Jason Momoa, and his cinematographer, Brian Andrew Mendoza, shore up a simple plot with a richly atmospheric palette of coppery light and caramel sunsets that makes even urgent events seem almost soothing.This laid-back attitude extends to Wolf (Mr. Momoa), a Native American who seems in no hurry to evade the dogged F.B.I. agent (Lance Henriksen) on his tail. Tooling along on his motorcycle, he hooks up with a scrappy musician (Robert Homer Mollohan) and pauses to dally with a sexy woman (Mr. Momoa’s wife, Lisa Bonet) in an Airstream. None of this is riveting, but the film’s loose naturalism and strong acting — Chris Browning, as a liaison between the F.B.I. and the reservation, is especially enjoyable — are slyly seductive.Backed by a perfectly chosen folk-rock soundtrack featuring artists like Shovels & Rope and Molly Gunner, Wolf’s journey may rest on a weighty issue (the poor policing of crimes on Indian reservations), but it never feels didactic. As he does on the excellent Sundance Channel drama “The Red Road” (recently renewed for a second season), Mr. Momoa softens his striking physical appearance with a restrained, sometimes playful performance. He seems determined to stretch beyond the warrior roles that have been his bread and butter, and so far the evidence looks promising. But he’ll have to do more than shave his beard to make us forget Khal Drogo.“Road to Paloma” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Laugh-free — except for some farcical, life-threatening stunts at the expense of Will Ferrell’s character, Brad — it is best avoided unless a movie that has the attitude and mind-set of a schoolyard bully happens to be your thing.Brad is the flabby, furry, contentedly married executive of a smooth-jazz radio station, whose loving relationship with his two stepchildren comes under siege when their biological father, Dusty (Mark Wahlberg), roars back into their lives on a motorcycle like an avenging superhero. Brad, ignoring the advice of his wife, Sarah (an insipid Linda Cardellini), insists on befriending him.The gentle, caring Brad is the kind of second husband women sometimes wed to exorcise the nightmare of having suffered through a marriage to a preening, macho control freak. As Dusty is about to descend on the household, Sarah warns Brad that Dusty is a combination of Jesse James and Mick Jagger. That’s not meant as a compliment.The movie, directed by Sean Anders (“Horrible Bosses 2”), from a screenplay he wrote with Brian Burns and John Morris, is a cruel, muscle-flexing fantasy of domination and emasculation. Early on, it is revealed that Brad has been infertile since an accident (shown in flashback) involving an X-ray machine in a dentist’s office. Dusty slyly informs him that Sarah would like to have another child, and persuades Brad to see an endocrinologist (Bobby Cannavale), who crudely compares the two dads’ private parts.Dusty initiates a competition with Brad in which he wins every round, all the while refusing to acknowledge that they are competing. He wows the kids by building a treehouse with an attached skateboarding ramp, which he navigates like a pro. He bribes them with cash and introduces them to sports heroes. Brad remains unflappably good-natured until he can’t take it anymore and has an excruciating public meltdown.Mr. Ferrell gamely tries to give Brad some comedic dimension, but for much of the movie, he wears a stunned, deer-in-the-headlights expression. The humor, such as it is, lies in Brad’s serial humiliations in front of his family. Mr. Wahlberg, who has little gift for comedy, is a blank. He camouflages Dusty’s diabolical machinations under a veneer of deadpan affability with no comedic subtext. Whenever possible, Dusty takes his shirt off and flaunts his pumped-up chest.Just as the movie is building toward a face-off, its testosterone suddenly drains, and it expires in a feel-good dance sequence; all is forgiven. Consider “Daddy’s Home” a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking.“Daddy’s Home” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Crude and suggestive content and some strong language.

Insects Never Looked so Yummy.,"If an enterprising restaurateur is eager to grill up some insects and make a mint in the West Village, the time has never been riper. “Bugs,” an entertaining and eye-opening documentary from Andreas Johnsen, will send moviegoers out with a feeling of culinary adventurousness, eager to sample well-prepared escamoles (ant larvae) or termite queen with mango. (The maggot mousse might be pushing it.)The movie follows Ben Reade, a chef, and Josh Evans, a researcher, then both of the Nordic Food Lab in Denmark, as they travel the world to visit cultures where insects are prepared as food. (Roberto Flore, another chef, joins the trip later.) The Nordic lab, a project initiated by Claus Meyer and René Redzepi, founders of the foodie polestar Noma, has a mission to explore “food diversity and deliciousness.” The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that the use of insects as food may have long-term benefits for the global food supply. It also offers cooks new possibilities for tastes and textures. (If you thought using whole animals was trendy, just wait until you try dishes that use multiple developmental stages.)As they pay visits to Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Mexico and Japan, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans are effectively M.C.s on the world’s weirdest episode of “Iron Chef.” (“To be honest, I would rather a normal Camembert,” Mr. Reade confesses after sampling casu marzu, a maggot-infested cheese from Italy.)Despite their largely successful experiments, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans express skepticism that the delicacies they’ve tried could — or should — be produced on a commercial scale.

Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night.The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere.We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring.Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen.Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled.

This practice should probably be reined in before it goes much further, lest the eye-popping become commonplace. That said, “Born to Be Wild 3D,” the latest example, is pretty cool to look at.This Imax film, which runs only 45 minutes, takes an abbreviated look at two women who are doing similar work with wild animals in different parts of the world. Biruté Mary Galdikas raises young orangutans that have been left homeless and motherless by rain-forest destruction in Borneo, and Daphne Sheldrick, at a preserve in Kenya, takes in young elephants whose mothers have been killed by poachers. The goal, for both, is to return the animals to the wild eventually.The women’s efforts have already had a fair amount of publicity, so the attraction here is the cinematography, and it makes good use of Imax and 3-D technology, with lovely aerial views and startling close-ups.

(Wait, “there’s another way,” the first character soon says.) After a while, you learn to stop salivating.“Air” is set in an underground missile silo where two men, Bauer (Norman Reedus of “The Walking Dead”) and Cartwright (Djimon Hounsou of “Blood Diamond”), keep “the last remnants of human civilization” alive. Earth’s air is ruined, and the men care for a collection of people who sleep in suspended animation.Bauer and Cartwright awaken occasionally to monitor conditions, then return to hypersleep. When Cartwright’s sleeping chamber is damaged, they must secure another before the ambient air is exhausted.“Air,” written by Chris Pasetto and Christian Cantamessa, introduces some interesting notions, not the least of which is that the privileged sleepers survive only because of two working-class men. But once an idea is introduced, it’s tossed aside, unexplored; though there’s plenty of talk, this isn’t exactly a sci-fi “My Dinner With Andre.” Tense music substitutes for genuine tension.Mr. Reedus and Mr. Hounsou fill the screen well enough for a movie with just two main characters (Sandrine Holt plays a small supporting role), while the claustrophobic mood conceals the low budget.

But not in “Make Believe,” J. Clay Tweel’s charming look at a very small subset of teenagers: those who are interested in becoming magicians. The young people seen here never seem artificial; you feel their passion for doing magic, as well as their nagging loneliness, devoted as they are to practicing card tricks and such for hours on end, while their peers are off doing what most teenagers do.The film follows a group of adolescents, including several abroad, as the young people prepare for a championship competition for teenage magicians in Las Vegas. They are genial, focused and smart. Here is Derek McKee, 14, describing his act, which he begins with few props: “I walk in with very little stuff. I leave with a lot of stuff. It’s the story of life.”The buildup to the actual competition is perfectly paced, with the film never tipping its hand as to the winner. And the championship has all the drama of a high-stakes sporting event: failure under pressure, unexpected triumph, gracious losers and winners both.MAKE BELIEVEOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed and edited by J.

Sequels are less expected, though, for documentaries about working-class patrons of Minimal and Conceptual art. But “Herb & Dorothy 50x50” is just that: Megumi Sasaki’s follow-up to her 2009 film about Herbert and Dorothy Vogel — him a postal clerk, her a school librarian in New York City — who accumulated an enormous and trailblazing art collection.Though the works are worth millions of dollars, the couple donated their collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1992. This collection became so large that much of it ended up in storage, away from public view. So, in 2008, after an agreement with the museum, the couple said they would donate 50 works to a museum or gallery in each state. This film documents that project, visiting 11 such exhibitions. (Mr. Vogel died in 2012, before the documentary was finished.)Ms. Sasaki said she was inspired to make this second film after seeing the first of the 50 exhibitions, at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. “I was shocked at how little I had known up to that point about the Vogels’ collection and their ability to discern and select artwork,” she says in the publicity notes. “Every new place I visited had me pondering, ‘What is art really?’ ”That is a big question. Yet it goes unasked, much less answered, by this film’s rapid-fire shots of the works on display. (The exception is a playful animation of one series of colorful paintings.)It’s difficult to dislike a documentary with such noble, generous subjects, but the film is unfocused and repetitious, not sure whether it is a road trip, a story of a couple or an exploration of small art institutions. Interesting ideas can be gleaned, higgledy-piggledy, but without much cooperation from the director.Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles. Directed by Megumi Sasaki. 1 hour 27 minutes; not rated.",0,,,0

A psychology student who secures a temporary academic permit enabling him to travel between Ramallah, in the West Bank, and Tel Aviv, Nimr has a bright future. Not the least of the obstacles he faces is his homosexuality, which if discovered by his family would bring disgrace and exile. His circumstances become more perilous when he falls in love with Roy (Michael Aloni), a handsome, well-to-do Israeli lawyer he meets in a bar. Roy works at his politically connected father’s law firm. Although Roy is out to his family, their acceptance is grudging. When he brings home his Palestinian boyfriend, it is all they can do to be polite.The movie, much of it shot in semidarkness, portrays the Middle East as a hotbed of paranoia, where everyone is looking over a shoulder, and a secret is hard to keep. Especially when cultural boundaries are breached, it is virtually impossible to separate the political from the personal.You might describe “Out in the Dark,” the feature directorial debut of the Israeli filmmaker Michael Mayer, who wrote the screenplay with Yael Shafrir, as a modern variation of Shakespeare: “Romeo and Romeo,” but with a different ending. Although Roy and Nimr’s affair is conducted discreetly, it becomes everybody’s business once Israeli security officials discover a cache of weapons that Nabil, an anti-Israeli militant has stockpiled in the basement of the family home. “Out in the Dark” tries not to take sides, and the Israeli security operatives come off as unscrupulous and bullying. They are not half as scary as Nabil and his band of incipient terrorists. One of the first targets of Nabil’s group is Mustafa (Loai Noufi), a Palestinian drag performer and friend of Nimr’s who has been secretly living in Tel Aviv. Seized as a suspected spy, he is brutally murdered. The weapons cache is discovered shortly after Nabil learns of Nimr’s homosexuality through a photo someone has shown him. He immediately tells the rest of the family, and Nimr is thrown out of the house and told never again to show his face. He has nowhere to go but to Roy’s. By then the security force knows about their relationship, and Roy’s reputation is at risk of being tainted. For all the tenderness and passion on display, the relationship of the lovers at the heart of the movie is too young to seem solid. Roy is the prettier but less likable of the two. Until he makes a sudden, unconvincing gesture of nobility, he registers as a spoiled brat who imagines that his father’s connections can solve any problem.Nimr’s neglecting to tell Roy about his brother is a serious lapse of judgment by someone who should know better. Even though the plot defies credibility at several points, “Out in the Dark” is gripping, and Nimr’s tearful exile from his family breaks your heart. As outside forces threaten to destroy the affair, you may think of Humphrey Bogart’s famous observation in “Casablanca” that “the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.” Nimr and Roy are two little people playing with matches in a tinderbox.",0,,,0

Like those films, his latest, “The Box,” is  sincere and sinister and inevitably ambitious, a serious work that insists on its own seriousness even when it edges toward the preposterous. As in his earlier films, he is again using genre (and pretty actors) as a vehicle to ask questions about the human condition (and conditioning) amid a thicket of high, low and trash cultural allusions and against a backdrop of impending doom. But the end isn’t nigh in Mr. Kelly’s world. It’s here.The similarities among all three of his features (he also wrote the screenplay for “Domino”) are striking and suggest that Mr. Kelly is developing a worldview, puzzling through the great questions, or fast-working himself into a creative impasse, maybe all three. Based on “Button, Button,” a short story by the fantasy writer Richard Matheson, “The Box” is the first of the  movies Mr. Kelly has directed that he didn’t write from the ground up. This doesn’t much matter, because the original story, which was first published in Playboy in 1970 and runs about 10 pages, is merely a humble scaffolding for Mr. Kelly’s mazelike narrative, with its sharp and snaking turns, its periodic dead ends and various pathway choices.Navigating those paths alongside the audience are Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) and her husband, Arthur (James Marsden), an attractive, seemingly happy middle-class couple who in 1976 are living  in a pleasant Virginia suburb with their only son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). Norma, a teacher at a private high school, and Arthur, an engineer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who’s hoping to make astronaut, live somewhat beyond their means, or so she says.  There’s a sports car  in the driveway, and Walter attends the school where Norma teaches Sartre’s “No Exit” to rich whelps more interested in her limp.  Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that after they receive an offer to earn a million dollars, they grab it.As in the short story, the payout comes with a shocking condition: they have to murder someone first by pressing a red button on a curious little box, or so says  the man making the offer, Arlington Steward (Frank Langella). Norma doesn’t seem terribly shaken by this stipulation or by the fact that she can see some of Mr. Steward’s teeth through the hole in his cheek. (Don’t worry about it, he says,  and she doesn’t, though I did.) Mr. Kelly doesn’t seem too concerned about the moral angle, either, which he takes his time getting to, creating a needless complication in a movie overstuffed  with complications, including severed toes, watery portals to another dimension, the Mars Viking mission,  murdered wives, tall ships and even, alas, the twin towers.A lot happens. Some of what happens tracks, some does not. Sometimes this matters, sometimes not. The actors are fine, and to watch Norma trying to persuade Arthur that they  need to push the button is to realize that Ms. Diaz should go dark more often. Mr. Marsden seems a little lost (you can’t blame him), but he handles the story’s hairpins. He’s also better served by the digital cinematography than Ms. Diaz;  shot by Steven Poster, the movie has been washed in 1970s browns that serve the vibe if not her skin tone. But Mr. Kelly leans too heavily on traveling shots here,  and his habit of slowly moving the camera toward something or someone, a creeping meant to intensify suspense, soon feels like mannerism.Mr. Matheson, perhaps best known for his novel “I Am Legend” (the basis for the Will Smith thriller), has described the idea behind his short story as “a sacrifice of human dignity in exchange for a specific goal.”  That more or less describes the themes, which he bundles together with unadorned prose, a heavy serving of dread and a gratifying, blunt, O. Henry-like kicker. It’s the kind of ending that can make you laugh out loud because the final twist of the knife is at once so expected and yet nonetheless pleasurable. (Part of the delight, of course, is having that expectation met.) Like many fine genre works, the story satisfies your appetite for tales of this type and leaves you a little something extra to savor.For his part, Mr. Kelly has an uneasy relationship to genre, or maybe he just needs a writing partner, someone to help him edit all his bright and dim ideas. “The Box” is alternately fluid and inspired, and rarely dull (though it is a little, on occasion). But too often it also feels strained, which might be expected from any movie that name-drops “No Exit” in one scene and the grim 1970s sitcom “What’s Happening!!” in the other. There are, as with his previous films, various visual gifts, like the spooky image of an airplane hangar glowing in the night and the odd image of Norma’s little toe waving like a finger. But Mr. Kelly is so busy sampling genres and confusing the issue that he rarely gives you time or space to enjoy them. In the end, he often seems as lost as his characters, trapped in a Pandora’s box of his own making.“The Box” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

SCOTT,"Review: ‘Baywatch,’ a Romp Full of Surf, Sand and Lots of Skin","In case the question should ever arise on a standardized test, the opposite of “prestige TV” is “Baywatch.” The series, which ran on NBC and in ubiquitous syndication through the 1990s, bequeathed a rich legacy of wet-suit fashion, Jet Ski safety and sunscreen awareness. In other news, Paramount has just released a movie called “Baywatch,” starring Dwayne Johnson in the role of the beach daddy originated by David Hasselhoff.The film, directed by Seth Gordon (“Identity Thief,” “Horrible Bosses”), can be viewed from several perspectives, most notably the abdominal, the pectoral and the gluteal. If torsos and tails are not your thing, other aspects of human anatomy are also available for study. Arms and legs, for example. But though acres of flesh are exposed to view — most of it pleasingly sculpted — there is very little outright nudity and no sex to speak of.You will, however, witness some rude and suggestive sight gags and an extended sequence in a morgue involving the genitals of a dead man. Those bits, and the energetic profanity in the script (written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift), represent cosmetic alterations intended to secure an R rating, at the moment a mark of credibility in the world of big-screen comedy. Make no mistake, though: The project’s essential network prime-time DNA remains intact. Like its source material, “Baywatch” is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It’s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun.Not everything is surf and sand and eye candy, though. A movie requires a plot or five, and “Baywatch” barrels through enough action and story to fill a couple of hours. Mitch Buchannon (Mr. Johnson) is the guru and patriarch of a squad of lifeguards — a “family,” as every franchise team in this fast and furious age must be called. The other principal members are C. J. (Kelly Rohrbach) and Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera). They must supervise three trainees: Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt (Zac Efron, looking uncannily like a young, ripped and shrunken Mr. Hasselhoff).Matt is a gold-medal-winning Olympic swimmer in disgrace, a bad boy in need of reforming. Ronnie is a pudgy nerd, with tech-geek skills and a brain-melting crush on C. J. Summer is there for Matt to ogle and flirt with, and to attest to the screenwriters’ utter inability to make a woman in a bathing suit an interesting character. Mr. Efron and Mr. Johnson are permitted to be funny and look sexy in their swimwear. The women mostly run to the rescue in their zippered one-pieces.A partial exception is Priyanka Chopra, who appears not in a bathing suit but in a succession of slinky dresses that signify — along with her purring diction, her muscle-headed minions and her collection of champagne flutes and martini glasses — her character’s supervillain status. That character, Victoria Leeds, is a drug dealer and would-be real estate mogul whose machinations threaten the Bay. And the only people with the integrity, gumption and sleuthing skills to save it are Mitch and his lifeguards. The Bay is their life, after all.For anyone contemplating the purchase of a ticket, the stakes are quite a bit lower. “Baywatch,” which, incidentally, features Mr. Johnson’s most credible acting since “The Tooth Fairy,” slots neatly into a subgenre that is perhaps too sloppy to have a name. But if you enjoy the “21 Jump Street” or “Ride Along” franchises, you won’t have too bad a time. The soundtrack hums with well-chosen, not-too-obvious hip-hop, R&B and rock classics; the humor is knowing and naughty without risking serious offense; and an inclusive brand of meta-ness is practiced. You don’t need to be privy to any particular “Baywatch” lore to get the jokes, and you’ll see a few nimble comic performers (Hannibal Buress, Yahya Abdul-Matteen II) in too-small roles.You shouldn’t expect much in the way of cinema. The digital effects — fire and water, mostly — are lackluster, and the whole thing has a crummy, overcast, second-rate-theme-park look to it. Except for the bodies, of course, which are really all you came to see in the first place.",0,58009442.0,58060186.0,0

Zazu in “The Lion King.” Scuttle in “The Little Mermaid.” But giving a bird or birds top billing is another matter, as demonstrated by “Storks.” This film, directed by Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland, is a harmless enough way to occupy a youngster for an hour and a half. It’s just not especially rich in extraordinary characters or moments.The premise is promising enough. Storks have long been out of the baby-delivery business and have instead been delivering packages for an internet retailer, cornerstore.com. But a sequence of events too complex to bother enumerating here causes the company’s long-dormant baby-making machine to produce an infant, and a stork named Junior (the voice of Andy Samberg) feels compelled to deliver it.He pairs up with Tulip (Katie Crown), a human teenager who has been raised by the storks since her delivery was botched 18 years ago, the event that led the company to get out of that business. Starting to sound complicated, isn’t it? It grows considerably more so as the story goes along: Bad guys (Kelsey Grammer voices the main one) try to thwart the mission; a human family violates zoning laws in preparing for the baby’s arrival; and more. The very young crowd that the movie seems aimed at may have trouble sorting it out.That can be irrelevant with young viewers if the characters are engaging, or the music. Yet (unlike in “Rio,” a pretty good animated film with bird leads) music is used only sparsely here. And Junior, frankly, is no Ariel or Simba. A pack of wolves and some penguins provide the best scenes. Blame the writing or the voice acting if you like, but maybe it’s just that birds simply aren’t warm and fuzzy or adorable. Tulip tries to make up some of that gap, but she’s one likable human in an undistinguished avian sea.“Storks” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mildly harrowing moments.",0,72655779.0,72679278.0,0

SCOTT,Keeping the World Safe for Rodents,"“G-Force” — perhaps the most expensive 3-D house-pet action movie ever made and, I’m willing to concede, probably one of the best — is about an hour shorter than “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” half as pretentious and twice as witty. Call this faint praise, if you like. “G-Force,” as loud and enervating as the words “A Jerry Bruckheimer Production” might lead you to expect, can hardly be accused of modesty, but on the other hand no film full of talking guinea pigs would be so rash as to attempt the kind of lumbering gravitas that Michael Bay has seen fit to bestow on a bunch of toys.The thundering, clanking climax, in which blenders, coffee makers and other appliances turn angry and amalgamate into robotic, apocalyptic threats to civilization as we know it, almost seems like a critique of “Transformers.” Or maybe “critique” is the wrong word. Kids like big, noisy, destructive metal robots. They also like furry little rodents who speak in the voices of Sam Rockwell and Penélope Cruz (especially all those 10-year-olds who dug “Choke” and “Vicky Cristina Barcelona”). So if you make a movie that has both robots and rodents, plus a bunch of swaggering catch phrases, a couple of flatulence jokes and a bunch of human actors hopping around pretending to interact with the computer-generated rodents — well, the pitch makes itself, doesn’t it?That seems to be the thinking — again, maybe not the right word — behind “G-Force,” which manages to be fairly entertaining in that exhausting, rackety, late-summer-kiddie-movie way. Mr. Rockwell and Ms. Cruz are joined by Tracy Morgan and Nicolas Cage, his voice almost unrecognizable, playing a mole named Speckles. The other three are guinea pigs, and this foursome is part of an off-the-books experiment run by a renegade government nerd played by Zach Galifianakis. The animals are trying to stop a diabolical scheme involving a consumer-electronics mogul (Bill Nighy) while being pursued by F.B.I. guys who want to shut them down.That will do for plot summary. Other animals include a dumb, neurotic guinea pig (Jon Favreau) and a clever, neurotic hamster (Steve Buscemi). The 3-D application (available in some theaters) has the odd effect of making the animated critters look warmer and more real than the actual people, and it must be said that some of the action sequences are impressively executed and edited. One of the best is a fairly simple gag in which two guinea pigs go rocketing down a suburban street in an old tire. I mean simple as a visual conceit, since a great deal of effort and ingenuity must have been expended in putting this amusing little sequence together.And far be it from me to suggest that some of that work, and the money behind it, might have been spent on a better script, or a different movie. “G-Force,” directed by Hoyt Yeatman, lives up to its promise to provide nearly an hour and a half of semicrude jokes and big effects, pausing for an obligatory scene of heartfelt lesson learning, in which the guinea pigs are encouraged to believe in themselves. Fine. It can’t hurt.But perhaps — getting back to that final showdown between the pets and the raging appliances — there is a deeper message in this film. Maybe it’s a parable about the power of technology, which as we all know can be harnessed for good or for evil. That is, you can build something that will threaten civilization as we know it, or you can make a 3-D action movie about guinea pigs. Or maybe what this film proves is that you can do both.“G-Force” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some intense action scenes and mildly naughty humor.G-FORCEOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Hoyt H.

It tracks their precedent-setting lawsuit against Robert Mugabe, the authoritarian Zimbabwean president, in a regional African court, as well as events on the ground in Zimbabwe: intimidation, threats and violence against the white farmers still holding out after a decade of  land seizures by the government.Many viewers will leave “Mugabe and the White African” thinking that they have seen few, if any, documentaries as wrenching, sad and infuriating, and those feelings will be justified. What has happened (and continues to happen) to the Campbells, the Freeths and some of their white neighbors is not only unjust but also a horrifying, slow-motion nightmare.  That sensation is reinforced by the movie’s political-thriller style, partly a result of the covert filming methods necessary in a country where practicing journalism can get you thrown in jail.It should be pointed out, though, that Ms. Bailey and Mr. Thompson achieve their results largely through the narrowness of their focus. Almost the only voices we hear are those of the farmers, their families and their lawyers. Other viewpoints are limited to a rant by the man, a government minister’s son, to whom the farm has been promised, and Mr. Mugabe’s recorded voice, including his notorious line that he doesn’t mind being seen as a Hitler by the West.It’s possible to honor the suffering of the Campbells and the Freeths and to revile the actions of the Mugabe government and, at the same time, to be uneasy with the emotions the film stirs and to feel that its one-sidedness and its nearly complete lack of historical and cultural context are problems. The farm’s black work force is frequently on screen and is presented as sympathetic to its employers, but the workers rarely speak. It’s impossible to know what their true, probably complex and contradictory feelings are.Mr. Freeth asks why being a white African should be any different than being a white American or a white Australian. It’s a good sound bite, but a moment’s reflection tells you that the comparison doesn’t hold water: the courses of colonialism and racial strife were radically different in America and Australia than they were in Africa. That doesn’t make Mr. Freeth’s cause any less just, but it does mean that “Mugabe and the White African” needs to be approached with care.",0,4542.0,,1

Unless the carbon-based energy sources on which we have relied are replaced with solar and wind power (the movie doesn’t address nuclear energy), we are ruined.Filmed on five continents, “Time to Choose” is divided into three chapters: coal and electricity, oil and gas, and land and food. Hopscotching from country to country, it begins in the United States with scenes of mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia and its destructive environmental effects. Much of the film’s power derives from devastating visual juxtapositions. The glamorous skyline of Shanghai at night is contrasted with daytime images of its smoggy harbor, crowded with ships carrying coal to fuel China’s insatiable energy appetite.The fossil fuel industry and its advocates are seen as the enemy in a David and Goliath battle, and they are not giving up without a fight. The corporate leaders Mr. Ferguson invited to appear in the film all turned him down. Apocalyptic in their foreboding, the images of environmental despoliation — especially in China, Nigeria, Brazil and Indonesia — are more powerful than any words voiced by the film’s soft-spoken narrator, Oscar Isaac.Facts and figures are spewed, and graphics are shown to illustrate the film’s life-or-death view of climate change. Images of the Niger Delta, polluted by international oil companies that have turned Nigeria into a corrupt petro-state, are, in a word, hellish.Somewhat surprisingly, Mr. Ferguson’s two previous documentaries — “No End in Sight,” about the American occupation of Iraq, and “Inside Job,” about the global financial crisis of 2007-8 — were grimmer than “Time to Choose,” which spends roughly half its time examining the rapid growth of clean-energy technology. Its development and improvement have lowered production costs so dramatically that solar and wind power are becoming competitive with fossil fuels.The biggest obstacle to change may be people’s assumptions that global warming is beyond human intervention.In the language of Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, who works closely with Gov. Jerry Brown of California, one of the film’s heroes: “First people deny that they’re part of the problem. Then they deny there’s a solution. Then they tell you that if there is a solution, it’s too expensive.”“Time to Choose” is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes.",1,29233.0,,0

SCOTT,"The Cost of Collusion, Paid in Phony Currency","The Italian writer Primo Levi, looking back on his time in Auschwitz, observed that in the Nazi death camps “the worst,  that is, the fittest,  survived.” “The Counterfeiters,” a brisk, tough new movie from the Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky, is in some ways an illustration of this axiom. Like most films about the Holocaust it is a survivor’s tale, and its protagonist, at least at first, seems long on guile and short on scruple. He is Salomon Sorowitsch, a master forger and a fixture of the Berlin underworld, and his yellow star is overlaid with a green triangle marking his status as a “habitual criminal.”This causes some discomfort among some of the other inmates at the Sachsenhausen camp, where Sorowitsch is recruited for an unusual work detail. An enterprising Nazi officer, who had arrested Sally before the war for falsifying currency, enlists him in a scheme to counterfeit British and American money. The plan — based on the real-life Operation Bernhard — is to destabilize the economies of those countries with large-scale infusions of fake pounds and dollars.In exchange for their labor Sally and his colleagues are given extraordinary privileges: civilian clothing, weekly showers, sheets and pillows on their beds. And this fragile good fortune provides “The Counterfeiters” with its ethical center of gravity. The questions Mr. Ruzowitzky poses are both stark and complicated. How much cooperation with evil is justified in the name of survival? How can the imperative to stay alive compete with the obligations to help others, and to oppose injustice?Sally, played by a remarkable, hatchet-faced actor with the striking name Karl Markovics, approaches these conundrums not with the discipline of a philosopher, but rather with the self-protective instincts of an outlaw. He does, nonetheless, adhere to the rudiments of a thief’s code of honor, surveying every new situation for possible risks and advantages and refusing, under any circumstances, to squeal on a comrade.He thus charts a zigzagging path between two other major characters: Herzog (Devid Striesow), the cynical, jocular Nazi who oversees Bernhard, and Burger (August Diehl), an idealistic prisoner who wants to subvert the plan.Burger, whose wide brow and upright carriage stand in pronounced contrast to Sorowitsch’s darting eyes and spidery movements, is the film’s designated man of principle. A left-wing activist, he was imprisoned for printing anti-Nazi leaflets, and he struggles to maintain a clear view of the political implications of his and the others’ actions. He decides to slow down Operation Bernhard by sabotaging the counterfeiting process, a delay that threatens the lives of his co-workers and brings him into conflict with Sorowitsch, who sometimes seems to view their assignment as a professional challenge more than anything else.But if Sally Sorowitsch is a crook, he is also something of an artist, and Mr. Markovics, without sentimentalizing the character, allows us glimpses of his soul. His performance is a tour de force of concentration and understatement, and it gives Mr. Ruzowitzky’s sometimes schematic narrative a jolt of realism. “The Counterfeiters” is a swift and suspenseful thriller, and perhaps a little too entertaining for its own good. The grim scenes in Sachsenhausen are framed by a visit to postwar Monte Carlo that adds a queasy touch of romanticism to the tale.I suppose that is a built-in dilemma of the Holocaust movie as a genre. Filmmakers either try to take the full, horrible measure of the subject, at the risk of overwhelming or alienating a modern audience, or else, in trying to make the story bearable, they subvert its truth. “The Counterfeiters,” in the manner of its flawed, fascinating hero, tries in good faith to navigate this ethically treacherous ground. That it succeeds more than it fails owes something to Mr. Ruzowitsky’s skill and good sense, and even more to his lead actor’s instinct and conviction.“The Counterfeiters” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some scenes of intense violence, and also some nudity.THE COUNTERFEITERSOpens Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky; written (in German, with English subtitles) by Mr. Ruzowitzky, based on the book “The Devil’s Workshop” by Adolf Burger; director of photography, Benedict Neuenfels; edited by Britta Nahler; music by Marius Ruhland; produced by Josef Aichholzer, Nina Bohlmann and Babette Schröder; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

But his criminal life has a gravitational pull that keeps sucking him back in.

O.K., actually it’s only the fifth feature, but what with the shorts and TV specials and video games, it feels as if there have been so, so many more.The key attributes of the movie, which is directed by Galen T. Chu and Mike Thurmeier, are undemanding and audience-approved. Anthropomorphized prehistoric cartoon animals spout endless contemporary-culture-allusive wisecracks (“You look nothing like your profile picture,” “Hashtag hashtag hashtag,” etc., and ad infinitum), alternating with Hollywood-standard family-values twaddle that is as facile as it is insincerely expressed. Hence, the movie’s actual entertainment value rises considerably during the dialogue-free sequences, most of which involve a manic squirrel, Scrat, chasing his coveted acorn into a spaceship initially encased in a glacier. He inadvertently launches the spacecraft, and flies around in a way that reorders the known universe.“Road Runner”-style gags recycled in computer-smooth 3-D animation still pack some punch, as it happens. A scene in which an electrical storm menaces the movie’s protagonists also generates some visual interest.The wide-ranging celebrity cast of voice talent here makes room for the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson as a version of himself, and Adam Devine as Manny and Ellie’s would-be son-in-law, Julian, who repeatedly refers to Manny as “Bro Dad,” a habit that is precisely as unendearing as it sounds. Eagle-eyed parents can rest easy; the role of Peaches, the object of Julian’s affections, is voiced by Keke Palmer, not the eponymous raunchy performing artist. I consider this a missed opportunity.

Balancing both proves to be challenging.In a sprawling home in Punjab, the families of Kanan (Suraj Sharma), a 26-year-old aspiring rapper, and his longtime girlfriend, Anu (Mehreen Pirzada), prepare for their wedding. But Kanan has his doubts — he thinks he might be too young for marriage — and to make matters worse, his family insists he first participate in a ceremony marrying him to a tree. (In this way, he is told, the hapless Kanan can avoid the usual fate of a manglik, a person born “under a cursed star.”)Soon Kanan is haunted by the glowing ghost of Shashi (Anushka Sharma, no relation to Mr. Sharma), a friendly female spirit only he can see, who has a connection to the tree. His initial terror of, and conversations with, a seemingly nonexistent woman gives his fiancée pause.Just when you think “Phillauri” is becoming a “Ghost Town”- or “Topper”-type romp, it switches gears, as Shashi imparts her own past. Flash back to almost a century ago, when she was a poet, secretly submitting verse to a newspaper under an assumed name. When she meets another poet, Phillauri (Diljit Dosanjh), a dashing ne’er-do-well, they fall into a love forbidden by Shashi’s pious brother. It’s painful to witness the script’s transformation of Shashi at that point from a hardheaded freethinker into a lovelorn obsessive. But things become worse for her: The abuses of British rule — specifically the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1919 — lead to a dire personal loss.We shuttle between eras until the threads converge in a present-day supernatural spectacular in Amritsar, attended by a legion of wraiths. Yes, Shashi’s soul finds peace, and Kanan and Anu become ready for marriage. But by then credibility has been drained and the drama has proved exhausting, unhelped by the listless male leads. (Ms. Sharma and Ms. Pirzada bring the spark here.)Mr. Lal, making his feature directorial debut, clearly understands the camera and special effects. But working from a script by Anvita Dutt that reaches too far in too many directions, he is undone by his own ambition.",0,459391.0,467596.0,0

It avoids the big confrontation or grand statement; doing so allows it to be an effective, if somewhat uneventful, study of the Brooklyn bubble effect.Gina (Melanie Lynskey), who is white, and Mack (Nelsan Ellis), who is black, move from trendy and comfortably diverse Brooklyn so that she can take a new job in a small town in Washington State. Their son, Clark (Armani Jackson), is getting ready to start sixth grade.Their new community has apparently never seen such a family, but the reaction of the locals isn’t hostility, it’s awkwardness. Everyone tries too hard, and no one tries harder than two girls (Miranda McKeon and Oona Laurence) who befriend Clark. They’re eager to fit him into their idea of what a black child should be.Rob Meyer, directing a script by Annie J. Howell, could easily have made this a movie about those reactions, which seem a little last century; the list of towns where a biracial couple is a novelty is fairly short at this point. Instead, he smartly stays focused on Gina, Mack and Clark, who in different ways are thrown out of their comfort zones by the reception they receive. Countless movies have examined what happens when a country mouse goes to the city; this one shows that leaving a gentrified urban oasis for a small-town world can be just as jolting.",0,,,0

God himself (Rishi Kapoor, in a white suit with a Nehru collar) sends help: a mischievous angel, who bikes to earth on a rainbow to save the day, Mary Poppins-style. (And, yes, Virginia, there are  dolphins in heaven.)Filmed in bright, saturated colors with deftly integrated effects and animated flourishes, Kunal Kohli’s enjoyable family comedy “Thoda Pyaar, Thoda Magic”  (“A Little Love, a Little Magic”) has a buoyancy and optimism that trump the predictability of its story.Though feather-light, “Thoda” engages some weighty matters: the Indian family and nation building. In a musical number set in a museum the angel (the always charming Rani Mukherjee) makes history come alive, showing the kids that India’s past is prelude to its great future. And, the film seems to say, that future will be built on strong families. When the businessman (a restrained and effective Saif Ali Khan) scuttles a big deal in Los Angeles to defend the children, he becomes stronger and more human.And as a vote of confidence in the Indian future, this grace note can’t be beat: with a wave of her hand, the angel turns the “H” to a “B” on the Hollywood sign.THODA PYAAR, THODA MAGICOpened on Friday nationwide.Directed by Kunal Kohli; written (in Hindi, with English subtitles) by Mr. Kohli and Rohena Gera; director of photography, Sudeep Chatterjee; edited by Amitabh Shukla; music by Dhankar-Ehsaan-Loy, lyrics by Prasoon Joshi; choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant, Pappu & Malu and Geeta Kapoor; art directors, Aparna Raina, Priya Raghunath and Malini Sharma; produced by Aditya Chopra and Mr. Kohli; released by Yash Raj Films.

Ms. Haysom pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact, but Mr. Soering has maintained that he is not guilty and that he gave a false confession, later recanted, to protect Ms. Haysom, counting on his father’s status as a diplomat to shield him.Over the years, Mr. Soering has won allies who have contended his innocence or argued for his repatriation to Germany, where he holds citizenship. The documentary, which features a lengthy prison interview with him, is hardly the first reconsideration of the case. (In 2010, while serving as the state’s governor, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia recommended approval of Mr. Soering’s request to be sent to Germany, where he would serve in prison, though Mr. Kaine’s successor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, reversed that decision.) The movie’s existence and findings have been mentioned in lengthy examinations of the crime in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.Marcus Vetter and Karin Steinberger’s sprawling documentary probably dives into the weeds too quickly and could have used a tighter edit. Still, drawing on a wealth of courtroom video, the film lays out a persuasive argument for reasonable doubt.Those who contribute information favorable to Mr. Soering include Gail Marshall, a former deputy attorney general of Virginia, and Chuck Reid, one of the original investigators. Mr. Soering comes across as a sincere and canny camera presence. He advises the filmmakers to shoot all they can. “You never know whether this will be allowed again,” he says.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,Kvetch Your Enthusiasm,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one: A guy walks into a meaningless universe. He sees this gorgeous blonde sitting at the bar. It’s obvious she’s never read a word of Dostoevsky, much less Kierkegaard. So he says to her, “Is it meaningless in here, or is it just me?,” and she says, “My place or yours?”I know, I know. It’s an old joke, and I didn’t tell it quite right. But that’s just my point. With material like this — a Jewish intellectual type shrugging his shoulders, looking into the camera, spitting out fancy Latinate words as if he’d just swallowed a thesaurus,  while an eager young actress of the moment flits around looks sultry and clueless — execution is everything. So my problem with “Whatever Works,” the new movie from, duh, Woody Allen, is not that the premise, more or less summed up in the paragraph above, is a wee bit familiar. Rather, it’s that the delivery is off.Mr. Allen’s unwavering belief in an empty cosmos made somewhat less bleak by the charms of old movies, older music and much younger women is one of the few things left we can count on. If the man ever gets religion, then we will know we’re really in trouble. In recent years his hardy epicurean pessimism, temporarily transplanted to foreign soil, has yielded a sharply turned crime drama (“Match Point”) and a snappy sex comedy (“Vicky Cristina Barcelona”). “Cassandra’s Dream” and “Scoop” weren’t terrible either.But Mr. Allen’s imagination has returned to Manhattan after that invigorating European sojourn afflicted by an extreme case of jet lag. In spite of a few up-to-date references — to Barack Obama, red states and gay people, for instance — Mr. Allen seems to have touched down in New York at some hazy time when Zero Mostel, for whom “Whatever Works” was originally written, still ruled Broadway. Those kids, with their crazy rock ’n’ roll! Those artists, with their wacky ideas!Those women! As is often the case they save Mr. Allen (and his on-screen surrogate) from his worst instincts, even as his treatment of them exposes just how low and lazy those instincts can be. Patricia Clarkson and Evan Rachel Wood, as a mother out of Tennessee Williams and a daughter out of “The Dukes of Hazzard,” bring not only feminine sparkle but also acting discipline to what feels, all too often, like a run-through of an unfinished play.The scenes, shot by the excellent Harris Savides, Gus Van Sant’s longtime director of photography, have a static, blocky feel. Their deliberate pacing and the decorous rhythms of the dialogue might charitably be described as classical, given the picture’s occasional evocation of a Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptation from the 1930s. A less generous word might be sloppy, given the near-total absence of the kind of Lubitschean verve of which Mr. Allen, when he’s on his comic game, is capable.To be sure there is a measure of vigor in Larry David’s performance in the central role of existential kvetcher, a formerly eminent physicist named Boris Yelnikoff. Mr. David does a lot of shouting and some antic gesticulating, and even throws himself out a window. But frantic action is not the same as acting, and there is barely a moment in “Whatever Works” in which Mr. David rises even to the level of credible impersonation.Boris hectors the camera, his fellow performers and humans in general, most of whom he regards as “inchworms,” “pygmies” and other endearments, and offers the film’s title phrase as the summation of his cynical world view. But “whatever works” — by which he means, basically, do your own thing, “filch what happiness you can” in the absence of metaphysical order — could also be the slogan of pragmatism, a more optimistic philosophical disposition, and one that would deny Boris both his self-pity and his puffed-up sense of intellectual superiority.Without which there would not be much left, and nothing for Melody (Ms. Wood) to love. She is a homeless Southern waif who follows Boris home one rainy night and, despite his loudly and repeatedly professed lack of interest in her feelings, her opinions, her long legs or her short shorts, falls in love with him. After they marry, things become a bit more complicated, what with the unpredictable nature of desire and the necessity of eking out the hour and a half between opening titles and closing credits.Some of that time is spent in a kind of dinner-theater “Pygmalion,” with the unworldly Melody — who is at first so dim that she can’t recognize Boris’s facetiousness when he says he used to play for the Yankees — taking on her husband’s tastes and crotchets. Other subplots involve the effects of New York living on Melody’s mom, Marietta (Ms. Clarkson), and her dad, John (Ed Begley Jr.), a pair of mismatched Southern stereotypes who blow into the Big Apple from Mississippi.The punch line turns out to be that Manhattan is an island of relative bliss in the bleak and hostile universe, but the tolerant, upbeat note on which Boris ends his ranting is as unconvincing as his habitual dyspepsia. None of it works. Or it works too hard. Whatever.“Whatever Works” is rated PG-13  (Parents strongly cautioned).

His second venture doing double duty as writer and director (“Happy Campers,” 2001, was the first), “Sex and Death” is an unfortunate comedy about sex and love and all those things that can prevent a man from getting from one to the other, including (ostensibly) hot  lesbian sex, (notionally) hot nonlesbian sex, (generically) hot girls licking spoons and hot (teenage) girls in school uniforms. And so it goes until this prince uncharming realizes he wants something, you know, more meaningful.In other words, “Sex and Death” is a hard-boiled fantasy with a squishy center. The man in question is a single guy with the kind of name usually  found next to a couple of X’s, Roderick Blank (Simon Baker), a looker whose bland existence derails when he receives a list naming all 101 women he will bed before he dies. The list puzzles him, as does the revelation of three guys in gray suits, Alpha (Robert Wisdom), Beta (Tanc Sade) and Fred (Patton Oswalt), who hang out in a white room weighing the fate of mortals and have some connection with the roll call. As these three rehearse the all-seeing, all-knowing routine, Roderick takes the opportunity to dump his castrating fiancée and liberate his inner player.The appealing Mr. Baker never manages to find the right tone for the material, partly because he’s been seriously miscast (he radiates too much decency and intelligence for the role), though more because Mr. Waters never establishes a coherent tone for either the character or his situation. As Roderick makes his way down his list, he veers unpersuasively from glib to crude, mawkish and desperate, with a little limp screwball and frantic mugging tossed in. The film generally remains unfunny, but in different registers. What Mr. Waters appears to have been after is the kind of crude romp that brings to mind the hustling likes of Dudley Moore, whose moves could have been synched to “The Benny Hill Show” and probably were.Oh, yes, Winona Ryder, who memorably starred in “Heathers,” shows up periodically as Death Nell, a mysterious vamp with a Black Widow complex and some nasty black heels. I’m not exactly sure what she’s doing in this film, and I don’t believe that Mr. Waters or Ms. Ryder know either.“Sex and Death 101” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,When a Bombastic Young Man Bestrode the Boards of the Mercury Theater,"The action in “Me and Orson Welles” takes place in 1937 during a single hectic week  bookended by two moments of relative tranquillity in which a boy (Zac Efron) meets a girl (Zoe Kazan). In the film’s final scene, as they stroll out of the New York Public Library, the girl, an aspiring writer, bubbles with enthusiasm about the world of music, art and literature that seems to be opening up all around them. So much is going on! So much to be part of!Though specific in its period references — the musical choices in particular are fresh and precise — this movie is much more than an exercise in nostalgia for those storied old days, when Harold Ross edited The New Yorker, Orson Welles bestrode the boards of the Mercury Theater and Brooks Atkinson reviewed plays for The New York Times.Instead, “Me and Orson Welles,” directed by Richard Linklater, with a screenplay (from Robert Kaplow’s novel) by Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo, pays tribute to youthful creative ambition where and whenever it may thrive. The story of a teenager’s sometimes uncomfortable brush with greatness, it is necessary viewing for anyone whose imagination has been seduced by the charms of art.Which can be a painful, disillusioning experience as well as a source of exhilaration. This, at any rate, is what Richard, Mr. Efron’s character, discovers when he stumbles into the Mercury’s production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” directed by a bombastic young fellow who lends his name to the film’s title and to so much else besides. “War of the Worlds” and “Citizen Kane” are still in the future, as are the triumphs and brutal disappointments of Welles’s postwar career, but the ego and the brilliance are in full blossom.They are captured, with a brio and wit that puts most biopic mummery to shame, by Christian McKay, a British actor with a slender résumé and superhuman confidence. His evident relish in the dimensions of this role is a crucial part of the performance. It’s so much fun to play Orson Welles because it must have been at least as much fun to be Orson Welles.Though perhaps not to work with him. “Me and Orson Welles” spends most of its time backstage at the Mercury, as the cast and crew struggle and stumble toward opening night, alternately buoyed and sandbagged by their resident genius, who is not shy about reminding the company members that they are servants to his vision. He showers them with hyperbolic praise — seeing “images of magnificence” in every actor’s eyes — and then crushes them with brutal criticism.His loyal partner, John Houseman (Eddie Marsan), endures it all with amused resignation. The others humor Welles, complain about him, try to compete with him or go to bed with him. They are supporting players in the grand drama of his personality. The only peer he might recognize on the set of “Julius Caesar” is Shakespeare himself.In that production Welles played Brutus — a complicated character, both noble and treacherous. And “Me and Orson Welles” shows him in similarly shaded light, illuminating both his talent and his caddishness. Best of all, the movie allows us to glimpse enough of the rehearsal and performance to see just why the Mercury “Caesar” was a milestone in the history of the modern theater.Art is glorious. The making of art less so. Richard, cast almost by accident in a minor role, learns some hard lessons about the ways of show folk, for whom sincerity is a higher form of pretending. He befriends Joseph Cotten (James Tupper), marvels at George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin), the high-strung British actor playing Mark Antony, and falls in love with Sonja (Claire Danes), who manages the Mercury and dreams of meeting David O. Selznick.Sonja is both ingénue and woman of the world, at once a servant of the muse and a calculating careerist, and Ms. Danes is nimble, likable and smart — words that describe the movie itself. While Mr. Efron may not conjure images of magnificence, he does well as the audience’s surrogate, an eager and affable adventurer in the enchanted realm of the theater.Disenchantment is part of the magic, and “Me and Orson Welles” strikes a persuasive balance between naïveté and cynicism, both of which are necessary to the theatrical enterprise.

Yet even when the film wanes, its subjects still come across as remarkable.In 1939, Waitstill Sharp, a Unitarian minister, and his wife, Martha, were asked by leaders of their church to travel to Czechoslovakia, where they would help Jews, dissidents and others flee persecution by the Nazis. The couple agreed, leaving their young children behind in the United States.Waitstill and Martha “left the comfort of a peaceful, small Massachusetts home in order to go into Europe on the verge of war,” one Holocaust scholar says at the start. “They were motivated from the beginning to go out there into the kingdom of hell and try to get some people out.”Before long the Sharps were living in a war zone and working to outwit the police there. Tom Hanks and Marina Goldman read letters from the couple that recount their exploits.Interviews with those who knew the Sharps are insightful. Yet footage of Nazi rallies and battlefield scenes often have little to do with the Sharps themselves, except to provide perspective on that time. Those visuals are typical of cable TV documentaries — a mention of Paris is sure to include a shot of the Eiffel Tower, while one of New York will have the Statue of Liberty. The tension that arose in the Sharps’ marriage also warrants more exploration than it receives here.In the end, “Defying the Nazis,” directed by Ken Burns and Artemis Joukowsky, a grandson of the Sharps, remains valuable to watch, and commendable for bringing the couple’s story to light. It’s impossible not to admire the Sharps, no matter how their tale is told.",0,,,0

But of all the talents squandered on this lemon, the most painful waste is that of its director, Rodrigo García, whose 2005 film, “Nine Lives,” and television series “In Treatment” revealed him as a writer-director with the sensitivity and insight of a contemporary Chekhov. Here that sensitivity is nowhere to be found.Instead of blaming Mr. García, I would rather point the finger at Ronnie Christensen, whose thudding, suspense-free screenplay mindlessly recycles gimmicks borrowed from “The Sixth Sense” and “The Others.” Mr. Christensen’s previous credits include the obscure television horror movies “Chameleon 3: Dark Angel” and “Monster!”Ms. Hathaway plays Claire, a grief counselor enlisted to conduct therapy sessions with a handful of traumatized survivors from a plane crash that left more than a hundred dead. No sooner have the sessions begun than her patients begin disappearing. But one strangely euphoric survivor, Eric (Patrick Wilson), pursues her ardently and seems to be able to read her mind.During group therapy sessions, suspicious-looking strangers lurk outside her office and peer through the windows. Arkin (David Morse), a sinister airline representative, also keeps turning up in odd places, and Claire’s boss, Perry (Andre Braugher), treats her as if she might need therapy herself.Eric is trailed by a wolflike dog that hovers expectantly outside his door. Hints are dropped that Claire and her patients may be the focus of a conspiracy by the airline to cover up its faulty maintenance.  Even Claire’s kindly neighbor, Toni (Ms. Wiest), is weirdly aggressive in promoting Claire’s  possible romance with Eric.With her wide, frightened Judy Garland eyes, Ms. Hathaway lends “Passengers” a frisson of anxiety. But how much emotional zing can be extracted from lifeless dialogue whose sole purpose is patching together 100 minutes of clichés?“Passengers” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

If you’re the brothers Naatha (Omkar Das Manikpuri) and Budhia (Raghubir Yadav), you opt to take a politician’s advice: one of you — Budhia chooses Naatha — will commit suicide, thus guaranteeing your family a government subsidy.That’s the premise of “Peepli Live,” a fitfully amusing Indian comedy that touches on a hot-button topic — the country’s rash of farmer suicides — as it skewers a hidebound bureaucracy (no one can figure out a way to get money to the brothers that doesn’t involve one of them offing himself) and the predatory news organizations that swoop into the village of Peepli to capture Naatha’s death live.The writer-director Anusha Rizvi, making her feature debut, shoots her story efficiently and with visual panache, but after a compelling setup her script runs out of juice. She gives the newscasters — modern city folk with practiced off-and-on empathy and inane, if occasionally hilarious, ideas about rural life — center stage, though they’re her least interesting satiric target. (They’re also probably what she knows best. She worked for four years at the Indian news channel NDTV.)“Peepli” has no stars, though it was produced by one: Aamir Khan, who took it to Sundance last winter. Still, Mr. Manikpuri and Mr. Yadav ably fill that void as Naatha and Budhia.

VERONGOS,Review: ‘A Moment of Silence’ Follows the Evo Morales Era in Bolivia,"In Bolivia, chewing coca leaves is a centuries-old tradition among native groups. The crop they grow is an anchor of the local economy, as well as a potential source of cocaine for the world market. As such, it was a target of United States eradication efforts, which hurt the growers but formed the basis of a comfortable relationship for the governing class, consisting of descendants of Spanish colonialists. That was the arrangement until 2005, when Evo Morales, a coca labor leader from the Aymara tribe, was lifted to the presidency on the shoulders of the nation’s indigenous majority.President Morales wanted nothing to do with Washington. He came to office backing his constituency and denouncing the violent tactics of his predecessors, who get lots of camera time, some of them from exile in the United States.In “A Moment of Silence,” about the forces that led to Mr. Morales’s winning three terms and the fate of his promises, we hear little from him, except in his speeches.While he delivered a constitution that recognized the rights of native groups, the film asserts that he resorted to the tactics of the leaders he despised. When his proposals undermined his constituency, the people protested, only to be met by government brutality, according to chilling testimony. “What does the president want?” one woman asks. “All these people voted for him.”This ambitious documentary, by Ferdinando Vicentini Orgnani, is largely pleasing to the eye, and it pays close attention to the eloquent activists at its core. Journalists of every stripe provide context, perhaps more than we can digest.There are so many talking heads that yours will spin. Still, seeing the protesters choose to march for weeks (wearing out or abandoning shoes) rather than give unquestioning loyalty is a refreshing reminder during our own presidential campaign.",0,,,0

The twist is that the muscular hero and villain abruptly cease fighting and begin making out. Neil, who is questioning his sexuality, is teased at school, particularly after his composition book is passed around a classroom.Fortunately, Neil’s scribbles catch the attention of Julia (Hannah Marks), who is a year older and just happens to write hot-and-heavy fan fiction of her own. She will teach Neil to assert himself and to have more confidence in his work.This sweet-natured coming-of-age movie, written and directed by Clay Liford, is perhaps more complicated than most by having characters whose sexual orientations aren’t settled. (Julia identifies as bisexual and says that all women are, although her perspective on herself shifts as the film goes on.) But it’s also a bit blah in terms of its filmmaking, as mechanical in its camerawork as it is in telegraphing plot developments. It doesn’t help that Julia, although nicely played by Ms. Marks, is herself written as a kind of fantasy: the worldly, pot-smoking dream girl who used to dress like an elf and, while not exactly free of anxieties, is assured enough to almost always say the right thing.The two friends accompany each other to a Comic Con-like convention in Houston, about three hours from where they live. There, Neil receives further life lessons from an elder statesman of the scene (Michael Ian Black). But for a movie about proud outcasts, “Slash” is a little square.",0,,,1

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘Moana,’ Brave Princess on a Voyage With a Chicken","Moana is the daughter of a chief and will someday inherit her father’s position, but she’s furious when Maui, a tattooed, muscle-bound demigod, calls her a princess. Moana (MWAH-nah) is not only part of a dynastic line but also a girl off on an adventure in the company of a cute animal sidekick (a dimwitted chicken named Heihei). So not just any princess, in other words: a Disney princess. She may be on a quest to save her island and restore ecological balance to the planet, but Moana (voiced by Auli’i Cravalho) is also upholding a brand.It is, as these things go, a pretty good brand. The Disney princess tradition has held onto its charm as it has changed with the times, widening its cultural frame of reference and allowing its heroines to travel down paths other than the one leading straight to matrimony. Moana, bantering with Maui (Dwayne Johnson) like a rival sibling and borne on her journey by the spirits of the ocean and her grandmother (Rachel House), has no need of a prince.In the Disney kingdom, the in-house influence of Pixar has reinvigorated the animation (though some of us may still pine for the classic, painterly Disney visual aesthetic), and the rejuvenation of American musical theater has provided a fresh pool of songwriting talent. “Moana,” directed by Ron Clements and John Musker from a screenplay by Jared Bush, includes a few infectious numbers by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a heart-tugging orchestral pop score by the Disney stalwart Mark Mancina. Buoyant songs by the Polynesian singer and composer Opetaia Foa’i (performed with his band Te Vaka) anchor the film’s cheery globalism in a specific South Pacific milieu.The plot is similarly syncretic, a mélange of updated folklore, contemporary eco-spiritualism and tried-and-true Disney-Pixar formula. Heihei, who beats out an adorable pig for the job of cute animal sidekick on the voyage itself, is a lot like Becky, the addled loon in “Finding Dory.” And the first part of the story, in which Moana’s anxious, protective father tries to keep his daughter from venturing beyond the reef that encircles their island, is a ringing echo of “Finding Nemo.”Once an ecological catastrophe (and her grandmother’s example) persuade Moana to defy her dad, she must overcome her own doubts (and Maui’s skepticism) and prove herself through a series of ordeals. Unlike “Frozen,” which spiked the formula with genuine surprise, “Moana” unfolds more or less as expected. Which is just fine, really. Archetypes are there for a reason: to provide reassurance and encouragement amid the squall and uncertainty of life.There are some touching and amusing zigzags on the way to the film’s sweet and affirmative conclusion. Moana inhabits a bright world of water and sunshine, into which the filmmakers insert a handful of visual and musical showstoppers. The best of these is probably a glam-rock pastiche called “Shiny,” performed by Jemaine Clement in the guise of a greedy giant crab. Mr. Miranda’s motor-mouthed synthesis of hip-hop and show-tune traditions provides jolts of energy and wit, matched by some clever bits of animation. Maui’s tattoos come to life, making his body an inky comic strip within the film’s splashy, colorful cartoon world.And, as usual, you succumb to an enjoyable experience that splits the difference between mythology and merchandising. Moana is an inspiring heroine, a smart, brave and decent young woman whose individual aspirations align perfectly with a larger, world-saving mission. She is also an exuberant and appealing self-marketer, whose likeness will proliferate on school bags and under Christmas trees for a long time to come.“Moana” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A little naughty, a little scary. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes.",0,248752120.0,248757044.0,0

That’s one of the unspoken questions raised, and largely unanswered, by  “National Bird,” Sonia Kennebeck’s elegantly unsettling documentary about the United States’ reliance on aerial combat drones.The weapons themselves, though, demand less of her attention than their psychological impact on three former operators and current whistle-blowers. Identified only by first names (though one full name is visible in a shot of a 2013 exposé in The Guardian), all three were involved in some form of top-secret data analysis and the tracking of targets. Justifiably nervous, they wear haunted, closed expressions as they relate stories of guilt, PTSD and persecution.“It’s like borders don’t matter anymore,” says Lisa, who eases her regrets by doing humanitarian work in Afghanistan. She’s talking about national perimeters, but the film cares more about the dehumanizing expanse between the drone operator and an often indistinct target. This is smartly illuminated by a re-enactment of an attack from an actual transcript, the video game similarities chillingly underscored by the callous conversation inside the virtual cockpit.Equally effective is a moving sequence shot in Kabul, Afghanistan, among the survivors of a 2010 drone attack that killed 23 civilians. But if “National Bird” wants to persuade us that the emotional and collateral damage of this technology is greater than that caused by conventional weapons, it needs to widen its lens. Interviews with military specialists able to elucidate the complex calculus of risk and reward would have been invaluable in balancing the narrative and perhaps clarifying the ethical fuzziness.Even so, there’s a sense that some unwritten human compact has been broken. As an ominously beautiful drone’s-eye camera glides above peaceful American streets, we’re uncomfortably reminded that an invisible death could one day hover over us all.",0,10019.0,,0

O. SCOTT,On the Run From Terrorists and a Disembodied Voice,"“Eagle Eye” is the latest evidence that sometimes, at the movies, more is less. For a while this hectic thriller, directed by D. J. Caruso, hums along efficiently if none too coherently. Some stuff blows up in Afghanistan, and then a lot of cars flip over in Chicago, while two interestingly mismatched pairs of actors with excellent breath control conduct heated arguments on a dead run.Shia LaBeouf, as a scruffy slacker named Jerry, is thrown together with Michelle Monaghan, an anxious single mom named Rachel. Meanwhile Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, to my mind a far more charismatic duo, flash badges and guns and quarrel about jurisdiction.So far, so good. The principals are a bit confused about what’s happening to them, and so is the audience, but that’s as it should be. Are Jerry and Rachel, who have been receiving menacing phone calls from a mysterious woman with an accentless, affectless voice, patsies in a terrorist conspiracy?It seems that way, but then again, why would a terrorist organization with the capacity to hack into cellphone lines, construction cranes, city buses and security cameras need to mess with stressed-out ordinary citizens? Maybe it’s not terrorism at all but some kind of government conspiracy. Or maybe ...I won’t spoil what the makers of “Eagle Eye” (including four credited screenwriters) surely regard as an ingenious plot twist. There’s no point. By the time you learn what’s really going on, you will no longer care. You will instead most likely be occupied in the sleep-delaying exercise of listing all the simpler, better movies this one resembles and in whose company it might have belonged.The basic premise — that Rachel and Jerry are at the mercy of a disembodied voice that knows exactly what they’re doing and can force them to do things they don’t want to — has a certain sinister elegance. Mr. Thornton, as an F.B.I. agent, is an entertaining fountain of profane folksiness. And Mr. Caruso, who showed some decent genre chops in “Disturbia” (also starring Mr. LaBeouf), executes some of the action sequences with flair and agility.But unlike “Disturbia,” which confined itself to a single set and one basic narrative problem — is the guy next door a serial killer? — “Eagle Eye” churns and flails and piles on pointless and improbable complications. Jerry has a dead twin brother. Rachel’s son plays the trumpet. There’s a top-secret explosive weapon, and a top-secret computer application, and a top-secret contingency plan to overthrow the government.Additionally, there is some obligatory mock-topical chatter (“blah blah blah Patriot Act blah blah blah Orange Alert blah blah blah cyberterrorism”), which, far from adding to the atmosphere of tension and suspense, only emphasizes just how farcical and harebrained this movie is.“Eagle Eye” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Few viewers are likely to make it that far, so let’s start where many will stop: the English-language title, whose meaning is never clarified.Instead of a land of the moon, Nicole Garcia’s mostly turgid, occasionally risible period piece, largely set in the 1950s, initially takes us to Lyon, France. Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard) spots a familiar address on a building that prompts flashbacks to a lost love.In her youth, she chases after a teacher with an almost feral abandon, privately licking his copy of “Wuthering Heights.” It’s not clear whether she’s mad, as some think, or whether her longings result from a repressive upbringing. The movie barely seems to decide.Gabrielle’s mother (Brigitte Roüan) arranges for her to marry a Catalan laborer (Alex Brendemühl), who is bizarrely nonchalant about the deal. (At Gabrielle’s request, he agrees never to have sex with her.)But when Gabrielle receives a diagnosis of kidney stones — the subtitles translate the French term “mal de pierres” as “stones sickness” — she travels to the Alps. There, the film offers “A Cure for Wellness” unexpected competition for the most ludicrous 2017 release set in a Swiss spa.Ms. Cotillard can be magnetic even when playing an unplayable character, but when Gabrielle falls for a veteran (Louis Garrel, who has perfected the facial expression of someone looking for another conversation), the chasm between her abilities and her co-star’s is mountainous.",0,45457.0,,1

After three “High School Musical” installments, “Bandslam” and the Fox series “Glee,” “Fame” — the 1980 film that spawned a stage show and a television series or two — was due for a makeover. The new version, like the first, covers four years at a New York performing-arts high school. And while the movie, the feature debut of the choreographer and video director Kevin Tancharoen, suffers from a surfeit of  flash, it nonetheless  offers the undeniable power of young performers pursuing art at peak dexterity.“Fame” revisits some of the original’s sequences, including a spontaneous lunchroom dance jam and an attempted subway suicide. But primarily it offers new predicaments for its students, among them Marco (Asher Book), an easygoing John Mayer look- and sound-alike; Jenny (Kay Panabaker), Marco’s girlfriend and a repressed actress; Neil (Paul Iacono), a goofy film director trying to finance a short; and Alice (Kherington Payne), an upper-crust dancer. Ahead of the pack are Naturi Naughton, as a classical pianist whose father disapproves of her pop-singing aspirations, and Collins Pennie, as an intense rapper-actor from the projects.Codgers can savor the glimpses of the teachers, played self-effacingly by Charles S. Dutton, Kelsey Grammer, Megan Mullally and Bebe Neuwirth, few of whom are flattered by the camera (though Ms. Neuwirth looks great). From the original, only the actress-choreographer Debbie Allen returns, as the principal.The 1980 “Fame,” directed by Alan Parker, melded fantastical sequences with quasi-vérité visuals, brisk editing and urban grime. It also addressed issues like stage mothers, coming out of the closet, racial competition, teenage pregnancy and demands for screen nudity.For grit, the 2009 “Fame” offers a desaturated palette. Alice’s affair with a working-class composer merely glances at class tensions; the most daunting peril is the casting couch. Rebellion? A first-time drinker is inebriated, vomits and vows never to  touch alcohol again.A closing multidisciplinary extravaganza lets Mr. Tancharoen and his cast flaunt their chops, and viewers, as with “Hair” 42 years ago, can celebrate the glorious image of youth in full creative flower. Yet when Ms. Mullally gives a speech about why her character left show business, you’re compelled to ask: Whatever became of Irene Cara and the other stars of the first “Fame”?“Fame” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Not quite fiction but definitely not a documentary, it’s a bit like a “Saturday Night Live” episode devoted to the film theories of North Korea’s Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il.A fictional, and noticeably humorless, South Korean filmmaker (Jung Yoon Lee) appears in short scenes set at a North Korean arts colony (upstate New York stands in for the Korean countryside) where she has enrolled — voluntarily, as far as we know — in search of greater creative freedom than she can find elsewhere. The bulk of “The Juche Idea” consists of the short films she makes during her residency, with titles like “The Tiny Dentures of Imperialism” and “The Winter of Abundance.” (The feature’s title refers to the official state doctrine, pronounced choo-CHAY, roughly translated as self-reliance.)These mix footage from North Korean dramas and propaganda films — swirling dancers, goose-stepping soldiers, Mr. Kim peering into a camera — with Mr. Finn’s own black-comedy inventions. One recurring motif involves juxtaposing quotations from Mr. Kim’s film writings with scenes from North Korean movies that appear to illustrate them; the primary effect of these sequences is to make you wish you could see more of the North Korean films.“The Juche Idea” is meant to be a comedy, one that cuts two ways: mocking the strictures placed on moviemakers in both Communist and capitalist systems. Viewers who don’t share the radical-nostalgist sensibility of Mr. Finn, who teaches at Emerson College in Boston, may find the humor both too rarefied and too obvious. One joke that’s hard to miss sets out his point of view. Asked what it’s like to make artist films in a capitalist country, the earnest South Korean replies:“It’s like building a homemade floating barge in a bay. People are charmed, supportive — offering bits of lumber or carpeting. But when it’s time to launch, no one notices because they’re all watching the cruise ship spread its diesel bilge and raw sewage.”THE JUCHE IDEAOpens on Thursday  in Manhattan.Written, produced, directed and edited by Jim Finn; music by Pauline Oliveros and Neung Phak; art directors, Jung Yoon Lee and Daniela Kostova.

They’re more like pretty children playing woodland games of hide-and-seek while in the throes of extreme puppy love.The film, based on a novel by  Honoré d’Urfé written in the 17th century and set in fifth-century Gaul, is staged as an outdoor pageant in the attractive French countryside. An unseen narrator pushes the story along. In this bucolic never-never land, the actors engage in stress-free agricultural pursuits and spend much of their time debating philosophies of love.As the story begins, the idyllic passion of Astrea (Stéphanie Crayencour), a beautiful shepherdess, and Celadon (Andy Gillet), an androgynously handsome shepherd, shatters after each observes the other apparently flirting with someone else. It is all a misunderstanding. But when Astrea refuses to believe Celadon’s protestations of innocence, he tries to drown himself in a river. He is saved and secretly nursed back to health by a group of possessive nymphs.Hearing no word of Celadon, Astrea assumes he is dead, blames herself and sinks into despair. Celadon is encouraged by a wise older druid to reveal himself to Astrea, but he feels he must obey her dictum to remain out of her sight forever. Such are the inviolable rules of courtly love.Much of the movie is taken up with theoretical questions about the nature of love. Is it the fusion of two souls fated for each other in a celestial union? Or is Hylas (Rodolphe Pauly), a twittery, buffoonish sensualist and advocate of promiscuity, the truth-telling realist? Not in this movie, in which he appears as a ridiculous clown surrounded by simpering groupies.“The Romance of Astrea and Celadon” flickers to frivolous life in its final third, when Celadon agrees to disguise himself as a woman so he can approach Astrea without her knowing his true identity. That she can’t keep her paws off the cross-dressed Celadon is proof of the fusion-of-two-souls theory, which Mr. Rohmer, now 88, seems  to espouse heartily.If the connections between this detached, dreamy fable and Mr. Rohmer’s refined contemporary examinations of young love in “Six Moral Tales” are obvious, the characters in “The Romance of Astrea and Celadon,” pretty as they are, are historical phantoms with little flesh-and-blood substance. There are hugs and kisses galore but little actual desire.Mr. Rohmer has suggested that “The Romance of Astrea and Celadon” will be his final film, and its view of love is the far-sighted perspective of a die-hard moralist gazing at the foolish world from an Olympian altitude, or perhaps from another planet.THE ROMANCE OF ASTREA AND CELADONOpens on Thursday in Manhattan.Directed by Eric Rohmer; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Mr. Rohmer, based on the novel “L’Astrée” by Honoré d’Urfé; director of photography, Diane Baratier; edited by Mary Stephen; music by Jean-Louis Valéro; production designers, Marie Dos Santos and Jérôme Pouvaret; produced by Philippe Liégeois and Jean-Michel Rey; released by Koch Lorber.

SCOTT,Review: ‘In the Fade’ Is a Tale of Grief and Violence in Modern Germany,"“In the Fade,” the new film by Fatih Akin, is divided into three parts. The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to “Law & Order” fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.Mr. Akin, whose previous features include the explosive “Head-On” and the sprawling, wrenching political melodrama “The Edge of Heaven,” observes his characters and their social environment with a rigorously measured mix of intensity and detachment. Katja, in the days and weeks after the attack, spirals through stages of grief, shock and despair. Surrounded by relatives, friends and in-laws, and visited by pushy, polite detectives, she seems desperately, furiously alone. Because her husband, Nuri (Numan Akar), was a Turkish immigrant and a former drug dealer, the police raise the specters of Islamist terrorism and gang activity. Katja is adamant: “Nazis killed my husband.” She has the grim satisfaction of being right.If the first section of “In the Fade” provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life — the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism — the second part zeros in on the gears of the country’s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous.But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back?That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie’s final section, which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as “In the Fade” should be reaching its starkest, sharpest point, as Katja’s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis, Mr. Akin’s focus seems to waver, and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling, when it wants to be devastating, and the political and personal sides of the story, rather than illuminating each other, fight to a stalemate.Ms. Kruger, however, who won the best actress award at Cannes in May, leaves a vivid, haunting impression. Katja, who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability, struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone, the world is dislodged from its axis, and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again. Dwelling in her sorrow is agonizing, but moving on might be even worse.",0,,,1

This will become an asset when the family moves to Florida to further the tennis aspirations of Jake’s younger brother (a delightful Wyatt Smith). Enrolled in a high school where social status is determined by the ability to render peers unconscious with your bare hands, Jake finally discovers the therapeutic benefits of breaking faces.Manifesting all the nuance and insight of a music video, “Never Back Down” plays like a pop-psychology seminar on fathers and sons. As Jake, his schoolyard nemesis (Cam Gigandet) and his martial-arts mentor (a slumming Djimon Hounsou) work out their daddy issues on one another, the movie speeds up and slows down as though controlled by a director in the grip of competing medications.

Instead of Cold War chess moves in the mode of “Funeral in Berlin,” it serves up the ostensible threat of Islamist terror. Racine is an undercover C.I.A. agent posing as an employment counselor in London. She’s loath to do fieldwork because she feels responsible for not thwarting a terrorist strike in Paris years ago. But she’s pulled back in by the prospect of a horrifying biological attack. She needs to interrogate — “unlock” in spy-speak — a courier whose message could set the plan in motion, or stop it.And here the movie goes very old school, piling on spy thriller tropes: double crosses; chases; a stock taciturn white-haired would-be assassin (who, conveniently enough, can’t quite draw a bead on our heroine); an eager recruit who might as well be nicknamed Dead Meat; and dialogue like “I’m thinking I’m the only friend you’ve got.”I suppose this went down easily enough for me because I grew up with this kind of stuff, and can surrender to it as a kind of cinematic comfort food. But still. For those not so inclined, the entertainment value could conceivably be derived from the brisk, no-nonsense direction by Michael Apted, and the talents of what they used to call “an all-star cast” — in this case, Michael Douglas, Toni Collette, John Malkovich and Orlando Bloom.",0,,,0

Desperate to neutralize the technology in his brain, along with its billionaire creator (Michael C.

(Mr. Neveldine and Mr. Taylor may share the directing instincts of a nerd on house arrest, but they could have a lucrative future in the renewable-energy field.)Edited to invoke grand mal seizures (the opposite of what you might expect from an editor named Doobie White), “Gamer” is happiest when shadowing the rear of Amber Valletta (playing Kable’s wife and a reluctant sexbot avatar).

The story has a boilerplate quality to it — father with a drinking problem; a pair of polar-opposite brothers — yet a standout performance by Theo Rossi (“Sons of Anarchy”) as the black sheep of the family overcomes a lot of the film’s flaws.The title refers to the car culture that took hold among Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles and elsewhere, centered on custom-made vehicles built low to the ground and outfitted with hydraulic lifts. Miguel (Demián Bichir), a pivotal member of a car club called the Coasters, is preparing his vehicle for a high-stakes competition. His reluctant assistant is his younger son, Daniel (Gabriel Chavarria), who would rather be honing his considerable skills as a graffiti artist than working on cars.Miguel once hoped that Daniel’s brother, Francisco (Mr. Rossi), would be the one to aspire to lowrider greatness, but Francisco ended up in prison instead. He completes his long sentence just before the big car competition, and both Daniel’s and Miguel’s lives are complicated by his reappearance. Also complicating things is that Miguel has remarried since the boys’ childhoods; Eva Longoria is underused as his current wife.There’s nothing subtle about this examination of cultural and generational clashes, and sometimes the director, Ricardo de Montreuil, and the screenwriters, Elgin James and Cheo Hodari Coker, veer into cliché land. They do a nice job, though, of slipping in explanatory tidbits to help along those unfamiliar with the lowrider world.",0,6155650.0,6179955.0,0

O. SCOTT,Bright Young Things in Love and Pain,"“Brideshead Revisited,” Julian Jarrold’s strenuously picturesque adaptation of the novel by Evelyn Waugh, conducts a whirlwind tour of the quadrangles of Oxford and the canals of Venice, always returning to the grand country house of the title, impersonated with lapidary dignity by Castle Howard. At Brideshead, Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode), a young man with artistic ambition and no special pedigree, falls under the spell of an aristocratic Roman Catholic family, conceiving first a “romantic friendship” with the dissolute, epicene younger son, Sebastian Flyte (Ben Whishaw), and then lusting, in his understated English way, after Sebastian’s sister Julia (Hayley Atwell).It is impossible to avoid mentioning that this story has been told on screen before, in a mini-series that was broadcast on PBS in 1982 and that holds up remarkably well. That version had a cast of first-rate British actors, some of them already known to American audiences (Claire Bloom,  Laurence Olivier) and others whose fame was about to take wing (notably Jeremy Irons, who played Charles). Mr. Jarrold’s rendition, with some fine British actors of its own, notably Michael Gambon and Emma Thompson as Sebastian and Julia’s estranged parents, is necessarily shorter and less faithful to Waugh’s book, and also, for what it’s worth, more cinematic. It is also tedious, confused and banal.But first let’s look at the pretty pictures. The earlier adaptation was shot in a functional style that favored expository clarity over visual expressiveness. Mr. Jarrold, free of any such constraint, goes for tilted frames and asymmetrical, poetic compositions. The cinematographer, Jess Hall, renders Gothic interiors in a chiaroscuro as rich and smooth as béarnaise sauce. And the clothes, the accents, the accessories! Ah, yes. England between the wars. Storm clouds gathering on the horizon, old chap. Lots of smoking and tuxedo-wearing in the meantime.It is not Mr. Jarrold’s fault that this landscape has been so heavily trodden over by others. But he and the screenwriters, Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock,  can be blamed for finding so little new or interesting to say about it, and for systematically stripping Waugh’s novel of its telling nuances and provocative ideas. His “Brideshead Revisited” focuses on Charles’s successive  infatuations with Sebastian, whom he meets on his first day at Oxford, and then with Julia, whom he encounters during a summer visit to Brideshead. In both relationships Charles is both passive and opportunistic, masking his prurience and what Sebastian and Julia’s mother, Lady Marchmain, calls his “hunger” with an air of sympathy and good manners.Charles is a complicated character, who causes a lot of trouble in the Flyte-Marchmain family even as he pretends to be a detached observer of its internal drama. The role calls for a mix of diffidence and magnetism — Charles is a shy, stoical seducer — but Mr. Goode shows all the charisma of a stalk of boiled asparagus molded into the likeness of Jeremy Irons. The film can’t explain why Julia or Sebastian would conceive a risky, tempestuous passion for Charles other than that Waugh seemed to think they might.Mr. Whishaw, an able enough actor, falls into easy, caricatural  indications of alcoholism and homosexuality, trembling and pouting and occasionally pulling himself into an attitude of doomed, fragile nobility. Ms. Atwell, by far the best thing about the film, manages to endow Julia, always the most enigmatic figure in the story, with a credible sense of internal conflict. Julia, like her mother, is headstrong and intelligent but, in large part because of her mother’s baleful influence, radically limited in her choices and chances.About that mother. Ms. Thompson  as usual is impeccable, but Lady Marchmain’s monstrosity betrays the weakness of Mr. Jarrold’s grasp of Waugh,  or perhaps his high-minded intention to improve on the old master’s unfashionably reactionary and bothersomely contradictory views about society and religion. Lady Marchmain, in this “Brideshead,” is a nearly allegorical figure of religious fanaticism and rigid piety. Her pathological devotion to her faith is what drove away her husband and deformed her children.Her dogmatism makes her Charles’s foil and provokes him, for once, to take a stand. At dinner he declares himself an atheist, and he and his hostess spar through clenched teeth over matters of the spirit. But the argument, as Mr. Jarrold stages it, carries no sense of intellectual conviction or historical context. It’s more like Dr. Seuss than Evelyn Waugh: The star-bellied sneetches had bellies with stars, and the plain-bellied sneetches had none upon thars.In Waugh’s book  — and, I’m compelled to add, that fine old mini-series it was made into — religious commitments and social relations were part of a thickly detailed, complicated and ancient lived reality. The long experience of English Catholics as a religious minority, the subtle gradations of class in the British university system, the crazy quilt of sexual norms and taboos governing the lives of young adults: all of this is what makes “Brideshead Revisited” live and breathe as a novel. None of it registers with any force in this lazy, complacent film, which takes the novel’s name in vain.“Brideshead Revisited” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual content.BRIDESHEAD REVISITEDOpens on Friday  in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas and Chicago.Directed by Julian Jarrold; written by Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock, based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh; director of photography, Jess Hall; edited by Chris Gill; music by Adrian Johnston; production designer, Alice Normington; produced by Robert Bernstein, Douglas Rae and Kevin Loader; released by Miramax Films and BBC Films.

Several dozen professional and nonprofessional actors audition onscreen for roles in the movie you’re watching, which is pegged to the 1996 murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty-pageant contestant from Boulder, Colo., who became a post-mortem media sensation. Her murder remains unsolved, which hasn’t stopped its exploitation. The director Kitty Green’s big idea here is to explore the tragedy and its aftershocks through the reactions of actors playing those involved in the case, including JonBenet’s parents. Some girls — smiling, dressed and made up as little beauty contestants — play JonBenet.Ms. Green doesn’t bother with the usual nonfiction signposts; there is no accompanying text or voice-over to serve as a guide. Instead, she records one performer after another on various soundstage sets who usually sit or occasional stand facing the camera, reciting (or reading) dialogue or holding forth on the real case. When speaking freely, some offer theories, a few darkly sensationalistic and sinister; a few theorists seem reasonable, but others come across as preposterous. Some seem to sympathize with the Ramseys, while others voice biases against the family. Some participants appear detached; still others register as deeply engaged, speaking about the case with an air of authority.Ms. Green moves from actor to actor, moment to moment smoothly, sometimes with vaguely sinister lighting, camerawork and music. The vibe is vaguely Errol Morris lite, though several setups suggest she also admires the fine-art photographer Gregory Crewdson, known for his moody, staged tableaus of suburban and small-town surrealism. It’s a handsome package that never transcends the banality of its ideas, most of which involve how different people, including from Boulder, were affected by the case. This is somewhat interesting for 30 or so minutes but grows grindingly obvious as we’re reminded again and again that people have feelings and opinions, some dubious.For the most part, Ms. Green does not obviously engage with her participants, but instead lets them talk into the camera. Every so often, a performer drifts or rushes into an apparent digression, as when one, who self-identifies as a “sex educator,” pulls out a few of his flogging whips and begins twirling them. It’s the kind of moment that another director might have cut. Ms. Green, by contrast, seems to believe that this moment adds something (outré humor, perhaps), but she doesn’t indicate what it might have to do with the rest of her movie or with the Ramsey case. This forces viewers to fill in the uninteresting blanks using her earlier cues and their own imaginations.That kind of filmmaking reserve or perhaps simply coyness is a stale tactic, one that too often gestures at nonexistent complexity. It’s a familiar game — call it theorizing by proxy for meaning by proxy — in which a filmmaker waves toward an idea, say, Brecht’s concept of the alienation or estrangement effect, without doing any actual hard, intellectual work. “Casting JonBenet” is filled with such ritualistic gestures that signal the movie has things of merit to say about assorted well-trod themes: identity as performance; performance as identity; the reproduction of gossip; the impact of media sensationalism; the sexualization of young girls; and that biggie, the United States. The only substantive conclusion, though, is that murder can be endlessly exploited.The question of whether the movie exploits JonBenet’s death is obvious; of course it does. The better question is whether it’s meaningful exploitation. To that end, consider the scene in which a few boys performing as JonBenet’s 9-year-old brother try to smash a melon with a flashlight while wearing goggles and rain gear. A couple succeed, and one boy eats a bit of melon. The idea, presumably, is to see whether one child could smash another child’s head in. The ridiculousness of the scene — and the melon — suggests that Ms. Green believes there’s something absurd about all of this, including the desire to know what happened. It also suggests that she lacks compassion. Vulgar in the extreme, the scene invites us to laugh, which is probably easier to do if you ignore the child who died.",0,,,0

Ms. Lorenzen travels far and wide for vignettes about yarn artists, showing off their work as they talk about it and the material they love.Toshiko Horiuchi MacAdam has made a climbing apparatus out of yarn for playgrounds in Japan. A Polish artist called Olek outfits performers in eerie-looking crocheted bodysuits. And Tinna Thorudottir Thorvaldar is an Icelandic yarn bomber, a sort of graffiti artist who works in yarn.“Feminine energy is rosy, soft, warm and colorful,” Ms. Thorudottir Thorvaldar says, contrasting that with the male-dominated energy of cities, gray and full of sharp edges.The film touches on but leaves underexplored the idea that yarn is a largely feminine art form that unites women across cultures and continents. And it makes only a cursory mention of the relationship between handicrafts, art and utilitarian art. But never mind. This much is clear by the film’s end: More yarn would mean a more festive world.

O. SCOTT,"Review: ‘The Secret Life of Pets’ Amuses, but Misses Opportunities","First things first: “The Secret Life of Pets” is preceded by a short film starring the Minions, in which those irrepressible yellow gelcaps take up landscaping so they can purchase a blender. You may regard this extra little cartoon as a bonus or a tax, depending on your level of Minion tolerance. Mine reached its end around 90 seconds before the movie did. But in any case, Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures are determined to keep selling toys and Halloween costumes, and it’s pointless to protest the merchandising of manufactured cuteness.Part of the Minions’ ostensibly universal charm lies in the fact that they speak no known language, but rather a chirpy, vaguely Spanish-inflected patois. “The Secret Life of Pets,” Illumination’s newest feature, relies on the more conventional sound of celebrity voices, mostly belonging to people who are professionally funny on television. Children may not be all that familiar with many of them, including Louis C. K., who plays the main character, a dog named Max. Louis C. K., on his television projects and in his stand-up, tends to work on the blue end of the spectrum, trafficking in melancholy as well as profanity. His presence here may be a gift to his own children, and to their college funds. It might also provide a measure of consolation to gloomy, sensitive middle-aged dads who need to sense a kindred soul on the other side of the screen.Similarly, Hannibal Buress (a dachshund), Jenny Slate (a fuzzy white lap dog whose exact breed I could not identify) and Lake Bell (a cat) might be here not because kids will recognize them from “Broad City” or “Obvious Child” or “In a World” but because youngish parents might want to feel a little bit cool at the multiplex on a Saturday afternoon. No shame in that! Fans of “Modern Family” will be happy to hear Eric Stonestreet as a big furry dog. Fans of Kevin Hart who want more after “Central Intelligence” and “Ride Along 2” will enjoy his impersonation of an angry bunny. Albert Brooks is a grumpy raptor. That sentence was a pleasure to write.There is also a guinea pig, some other birds, lizards and even a few human beings. But this is mostly a dog story, full of capers and complications arising from the arrival of Duke (the big shaggy one voiced by Mr. Stonestreet) into the household Max shares with Katie (Ellie Kemper), his millennial owner. There is rivalry and resentment and eventually friendship. “The Secret Life of Pets,” written by Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch and directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud, is like one of those picture books about how to deal with a new baby, but with talking animals.Which is, all in all, pretty good fun. Talking-animal cartoons generally are, if they have even a modest quantity of wit or cross-species insight. And while this movie never achieves — and does not really aim for — the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of “Zootopia,” it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit.As the title suggests, the conceit is that when we humans are away, our furry, scaly, feathered companions get up to all kinds of mischief. They visit one another’s apartments, they dance and flirt and play loud music and then, when we return, pretend that they’ve been waiting for us the whole time. Except for the cats, of course, who make a great show of not caring.ImageTiberius, voiced by Albert Brooks, left, and Gidget, voiced by Jenny Slate.CreditUniversal PicturesHere I should say that, while Ms. Bell’s purring vocalizations are beyond reproach, the film is clearly the work of dog people, and traffics — like nearly every other movie in its genre — in some tired anti-feline stereotypes. I could go on about this, but I’m not supposed to let my political opinions affect my reviews. And I’m not biased. Dogs are fine. I have shared my home and opened my heart to a few of them. But they’re also just too easy, with their wet noses and broad pink tongues and eagerness to please. Cats are demanding. Complex. A more daring movie would have ventured beyond fat, pampered house cats and scrawny alley predators in its depiction of them. Representation matters.Speaking of politics, the house pets encounter an underground militant organization led by Mr. Hart’s adorably fuzzy, implacable little rabbit. He steals the movie, of course, and helps it ascend to a level of anarchic delight. The animated action is bouncy and frenetic, and if the story becomes a little too busy, it moves quickly and makes room for a barrage of jokes and even some character development. Ms. Slate’s Gidget the lap dog evolves from a lovestruck princess (pining for Max) into a fierce and resourceful action heroine. Max himself grows less self-involved. Everyone gets home safely.Like the “Despicable Me” movies, which put Illumination on the map (and spawned those furshlugginer Minions), “The Secret Life of Pets” is adequate animated entertainment, amusing while it lasts but not especially memorable except as a catalog of compromises and missed opportunities. Among those are the New York setting, a potential wonderland of glamour, filth and imagination that is rendered as blandly as if the movie had been shot on a back-lot set.“The Secret Life of Pets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Fewer poop jokes than you might expect. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.",0,368305960.0,368384330.0,1

In the late 1990s, a Dutch couple, Martin Verfondern and Margo Pool, post-hippie types looking to carve out a place for themselves far from the modern-day rat race — to get off the grid, as some say today — found an isolated village there whose name, Santa Eulalia, has over the years been compressed to Santoalla. At the opening of this documentary with the same name, directed by Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer, it’s plain that things did not work out as planned for the couple: Home-video footage shows Martin approaching a neighbor who calmly raises the handle of a farm tool and brings it down on the camera, causing the recording to go black.Ms. Pool narrates this chronicle, talking about how her husband disappeared in 2010, as Mr. Becker and Mr. Mehrer jump around in time. The couple are initially portrayed as sympathetic. Their only neighbors in Santoalla are the Rodriguez family, made up of the quiet patriarch, Manolo (he’s the camera smiter); the chatty, religious wife, Jovita; and their two sons, the voluble Carlos and Julio, who suffers from mental disorders.At first these families get along reasonably well. As the filmmakers introduce more archival footage, Mr. Verfondern comes across as less laid-back as he initially seemed. His plans for developing his land into some utopian retreat often run afoul of the Rodriguezes, and a dispute over shared forest areas leads to a courtroom battle. Soon the families aren’t even speaking to each other. Then Mr. Verfondern vanishes, seemingly without a trace. At this point the narrative deliberately goes slack as Ms. Pool weighs her options. “Santoalla” ends with the mystery solved. The threads that remain hanging imbue this peculiar story of paradise lost with a tragic resonance.",0,,,1

Several of those are full of energy, even when delivered by the lone actor in this film adaptation of a one-man play.Aaron Davidman, the writer and performer, toured with the theatrical show for years before adapting it to the screen. In the film, he embodies more than a dozen men and women affected by decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.Perhaps because of the show’s stage pedigree, Mr. Davidman emphasizes large emotions at the expense of smaller moments, a choice that works best in scenes like one in which a rabbi describes his fury with those he believes have warped his religion or when a Palestinian explains his people’s long-term commitment to overcoming what he sees as Israeli oppression. Dylan Kussman, the director, places Mr. Davidman alternately in front of an audience, in an empty theater and in a desert, and through sharp edits and angles fosters a sense of immediacy.Still, there’s no getting around that this is a filmed version of a one-person play, with all the shortcomings inherent in such a project, and without the magic that live performance can generate. Sometimes the effort here is more admirable than exciting.Mr. Davidman ends up not far from where he begins — his first line is “It’s complicated.” But that doesn’t mean nothing is gained. The stories in “Wrestling Jerusalem” help to humanize issues too often spoken of in terms of land and politics. Every step forward, no matter how slight, is worth something.",0,,,0

Still, there are dividends. A documentary like “By Sidney Lumet,” for instance, gives you a chance to hang out with a favorite filmmaker, to listen to him talk about his life and work, to hear the cadences and occasional cracks in his voice. True, there are moments when you wish you were watching one of his movies instead, but there’s something to be said for a tribute that inspires you to revisit the films and again seek out “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” “Serpico,” “Q&A” and his masterpiece, “Dog Day Afternoon.” (Mr. Lumet died in 2011 at 86.)“By Sidney Lumet” began as on-camera interviews shot and produced in 2008 by Daniel Anker and Thane Rosenbaum for the PBS show “American Masters.” After Mr. Anker died in 2014, Nancy Buirski was brought in to turn these interviews into a movie. (Mr. Rosenbaum stayed on as a producer.) It must have been a tough gig to resist and to finish, just because of its subject. Yet while it’s no surprise that Mr. Lumet can spin a tale, these murky-looking, less-than-flattering sit-downs are irritatingly suboptimal, particularly given that he was so great at telling intimate stories about men in shadows.Mr. Lumet spent a lifetime in show business, a path that began in New York’s Yiddish theater. His father, Baruch Lumet, was an actor, his mother, Eugenia Wermus, was a dancer, and the $35 a week that the family made from acting on a Yiddish radio show, “The Rabbi From Brownsville” helped them survive the Depression. The younger Lumet was on Broadway by 1935, in “Dead End,” though not as one of its famous kids; he did play a dirty-faced angel in the 1939 film “One Third of a Nation,” a social realist fantasia. These early years are some of the most engaging parts of “By Sidney Lumet,” and they’re sketched in through the interviews and with distinctive archival photos and film clips.Mr. Lumet lived one of those exciting 20th-century American lives that seemed to hitch a ride on every artistic and political wave, with no dull acts or minor characters. He was a child member of the Group Theater; as a teenager he performed alongside Lotte Lenya. When his first movie, “12 Angry Men” (1957), opened, he was 32 and a seasoned theater and TV professional, having worked with Max Reinhardt, Walter Bernstein, Abraham Polonsky and Yul Brynner, then a CBS director who helped Mr. Lumet break into TV. Over a half-century, he directed more than 40 movies — or pictures, as he called them — including critical and popular triumphs as well as misfires that are largely ignored here.“By Sidney Lumet” gets a lot of this in as it jumps from topics and skips around in time, from past to present and back again. It serviceably sketches in his personal life, landing harder on themes (fathers and sons) than on details, a balance that would be fine if it didn’t produce some nagging questions, including about women (his mother and wives). The largest problem is that Ms. Buirski has a fixed idea about his work that flattens it, as underscored by her choices in film clips, notably from “12 Angry Men” and its big speeches. Mr. Lumet comes across as a mensch, but he was also a complex artist whose often literally dark films were filled with shadows, rage and spit, not just nobility.“By Sidney Lumet” is not rated.

VERONGOS,Review: ‘Harry & Snowman’ Recalls a Man and a Horse of Powerful Haunches,"The Snowman of Ron Davis’s documentary “Harry & Snowman” is a horse that melts the heart. Purchased in the 1950s for $80 off a truck bound for the slaughterhouse, Snowman became a champion show jumper. And that was only one surprise in the long friendship that began when this scruffy white gelding locked eyes with Harry deLeyer, who raised horses and taught riding at a girls’ school in Long Island.On camera, Mr. deLeyer says he felt an immediate connection with Snowman. A Dutch immigrant — the movie shares tantalizing tidbits about his past in the underground in World War II — Mr. deLeyer tells of hiding Jews in the cellars of family barns in the Netherlands.When we meet him, Mr. deLeyer is pushing 86 and still riding. As a young man, he looked dashing in his riding clothes, as seen in archival footage. His daughter Harriet deLeyer explains that the horses always took priority over his eight children. So did her father’s career. “A lot of times the kids went without so that he could have,” she said.This film skillfully challenges our expectations by unfolding Snowman’s abilities one at a time: In summer he is a swimming water taxi for a passel of deLeyer children; in winter he pulls them on skis.And once his rarest talent is shown, he soars. As Snowman takes the highest jumps, gathering his haunches, he extends himself until his body is almost vertical, as if he were climbing a mountain.In the film, a student of Mr. deLeyer’s recalls some of his advice: “Throw your heart over the top, and your horse will follow.” “Harry & Snowman” makes you want to do the same.",1,,,0

Or you could think of it as a crazy story about a stalker who sweet-talks a little girl whom he later seduces when she’s a teenager only to then knock her up and emotionally, psychologically and spiritually knock her down again and again, as he hopscotches naked across the time-space continuum.Of course one woman’s romantic fantasy can be another’s gas-lighted nightmare, which is why it’s easy to read Audrey Niffenegger’s chart-busting novel in such dramatically different ways. A chronological confusion, it turns on a contemporary romance between an unwilling time traveler, Henry, and the woman he marries, Clare. In the novel the romance comes across as airy and coy and unpersuasive. But what feels light on the page   can seem exceedingly ponderous once a filmmaker transposes those words into the visual realm. It is, after all, one thing to read about a naked guy talking up a 6-year-old girl while he’s hiding in some bushes. It’s another thing entirely to watch the big, strapping, healthy Eric Bana groping the greens.It isn’t his fault. Indeed, watching Mr. Bana frequently strut his seminude stuff, nimbly avoiding the full-frontal reveal even as he flashes some discreet cheek, is one of the few pleasures afforded by this often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation. A sometime librarian, Henry has been born with a genetic anomaly that causes him to take abrupt hops across time, losing his clothes in the process. He first meets Clare (a frumped-up Rachel McAdams) when he’s 28, and she’s a 20-year-old art student. She’s new to Henry, but she knows and adores him because he has been regularly visiting her since she was 6, popping in and out of her life, though always when he was older. (Got that?)Much like Henry, the novel jumps all over the timeline and unfolds through alternating he-said, she-said, first-person voices. Notably it’s Henry who first describes an early, crucial encounter between his 36-year-old self and the  self-possessed 6-year-old Clare, which shrewdly puts you right inside his (innocent) head. First-person narration in novels can make you feel intensely close to a character, as if you had crawled into another being. In the book you’re not only by Henry’s side when he’s hiding in those bushes: you’re also on his side, or at least that’s the idea. This means that by the time the 6-year-old Clare describes a similar  encounter pages later, the potential ick factor has already been  defused.On the screen, however, because the camera hovers vaguely between her point of view and Henry’s — and because the director Robert Schwentke lays a heavy hand on every nuance and has made a dirge about love instead of an ode — the scene wobbles between unpersuasive comedy and outright creepiness, as does much of the movie. It’s instructive that when the book isn’t drooping under the weight of its metaphor (Men! They’re always leaving!), it makes room for pleasure amid the trauma. Ms. Niffenegger grasps the melodramatic truism that tears sting the strongest when the audience feels as if it had lost something, which helps explain her sales. By contrast, the filmmakers (the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin) shroud the movie in foreboding as Henry looks for some clothes, and you search for your smile.“The Time Traveler’s Wife” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

946,2010-05-05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:11,A. O. SCOTT,"An Eccentric Life, From Polio to Punk","Great musicians have uniquely fascinating lives, but their film biographies are all alike. The latest illustration of this paradox — definitively mocked in “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” a few years back — is “Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,” a dutiful and admiring film about Ian Dury, one of the more eccentric stars of British punk rock. The film, directed by Mat Whitecross and written by Paul Viragh, hits the usual narrative marks: childhood trauma, artistic struggle and triumph, family upheaval and substance abuse. Its flashes of style are sometimes lively but more often seem, like the slavish period décor, to be desperate attempts to overcome the built-in inertia of the genre.This is a shame, since “Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll” sets out to celebrate a wild man in a crazy time. Dury, who died in 2000 at 57, had been kicking around for a while, but with the arrival of punk his eccentric, anarchic blend of underdog anger and music-hall mischief suddenly made sense. While the song that gives this film its name was banned by the BBC, “New Boots and Panties!!,” Dury’s debut album with his band, the Blockheads, was an international hit and remains one of the liveliest musical artifacts of its time.There is no doubt that the filmmakers harbor great affection for Dury, his music and his milieu. And in Andy Serkis, the British actor best known for lending his voice and skinny frame to the computer-generated Gollum in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, they have found a performer impressively able to convey Dury’s impish charm, as well as the less appealing aspects of his personality.The formidably gifted supporting cast includes Olivia Williams as Dury’s wife, Betty; Naomie Harris as Denise, the young music fan who was his muse and live-in lover; Ray Winstone as a flashback-dwelling father; and Toby Jones as the authority figure who would spur young Dury’s rebellion. Dury’s childhood polio and subsequent disability form the dramatic core of the film, but his struggle with the disease and its aftereffects also gives the movie an element of sentimental predictability.A gifted, restless man overcomes adversity and wrestles with demons, testing the patience of those who love him and earning the audience’s admiration through sheer talent and force of will. That is Ian Dury’s life story, perhaps, but it could be anyone’s, and somehow this well-intentioned film cannot help but turn an uncompromisingly original artist into a formula.SEX & DRUGS & ROCK & ROLLOpens on Wednesday  in Manhattan.Directed by Mat Whitecross; written by Paul Viragh; director of photography, Chris Ross; edited by Peter Christellis; music by Chaz Jankel; production designer, Richard Bullock; costumes by Joanna Eatwell; produced by Damian Jones; released by Tribeca Film.

Hex takes the form of Josh Brolin, who can play tough and hard but here is playing tough and funny while wearing a face that looks like a bowl of Hamburger Helper as whipped up by Chester Gould. Hex was scarred, both physically and psychologically, by another Confederate veteran, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), who has emerged to wreak ruin on a united nation he despises.Though it has bad word of mouth, “Jonah Hex” is generally better, sprier and more diverting than most of the action flicks now playing, “The A-Team” included. The director of “Hex,” Jimmy Hayward, whose first feature was the animated children’s movie “Horton Hears a Who!,” isn’t Sergio Leone, but he maintains a lightness of touch throughout, a welcome change from the lugubriousness that tends to weigh down so many big-screen adaptations of comic books. The cast is weird and slightly confusing — Aidan Quinn, Will Arnett and a very good Michael Fassbender — if solid. As the requisite hooker, Megan Fox has about 15 minutes of screen time, but she fills out the Victorian hooker clothes that make the most of her swelling, perspiring bosom.There’s also a horse and an excellent dog with which Mr. Brolin has terrific chemistry.Jonah Hex” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The pulpmeister of the horror lollapalooza “What Ever  Happened to Baby Jane?” certainly knew how to build a grand showcase for his corrugated divas (Bette Davis and Joan Crawford), while the hapless Jon Avnet hasn’t a clue what to do with his (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro). In “Righteous Kill” these two godheads of 1970s cinema go macho-a-macho with each other — furrowing brows, bellowing lines, looking alternately grimly serious and somewhat bemused  —  in a B-movie (more like C-minus) duet that probably sounded like a grand idea when their handlers whispered it in their ears.Mr. De Niro and Mr. Pacino have squared off only once  before on the big screen, in Michael Mann’s 1995 thriller, “Heat,” in which they spent most of the film in separate story lines, joined only by the parallel editing and a late-act, disappointingly anticlimactic meeting at a diner. They share far more face time in “Righteous Kill,” playing well-seasoned New York City Police Department detectives and long-term partners who take turns clucking at each other like hens while swaggering around town like gamecocks. True to strut, pouf and wattles, Mr. Pacino’s cop goes by Rooster, while Mr. De Niro is just Turk, which doesn’t appear to be short for Turkey, though it sure does help to pass the time if you think about it.Time, alas, doesn’t so much pass in “Righteous Kill” as crawl, despite the usual overcutting, which tries to pump energy into the inert proceedings. Mr. Avnet, whose last movie was the clunker “88 Minutes” (one of Mr. Pacino’s worst), is not a natural director, to put it kindly. His handiwork is most evident in the unsteady tone, though to be fair it’s always hard to know who deserves most of the blame for this kind of star-struck, suit-crammed (eight producers, three executive producers, one co-producer) mush. Suffice it to say that everything from the camera placement to the cheap use of the consistently good, lamentably underemployed Carla Gugino is shoddy. (Note to Mr. Avnet: Yes, Ms. Gugino has breasts, but, really, her acting is more interesting.)Like most actors, Mr. Pacino and Mr. De Niro need a strong hand, some kind of visionary authority to put them in their best light and prevent them from leaning on the tics and tricks  —  Mr. Pacino tends to turn up the volume, while Mr. De Niro glowers until he looks ready to pop  —  that now too often mar their performances. “Righteous Kill,” a clutter of recycled cop-movie and serial-killer film clichés (it’s hard to believe that the screenwriter, Russell Gewirtz, also wrote “Inside Man”), is far from their worst effort. And the two have some nice moments with each other and some of the other actors. Mr. Pacino seems to be genuinely moved during his final showdown with Mr. De Niro, or maybe he’s just a sweet sentimental fool.“Righteous Kill” is rated R.

A champion of Modernist Los Angeles architects, Mr. Shulman, who died at 98 in July, greatly advanced their reputations with his expansive, exquisitely composed images. Mr. Bricker’s supple, streamlined film should do much to advance Mr. Shulman’s.Mr. Shulman’s big break came in 1936, from Richard Neutra, who had him document his creations. Mr. Shulman’s talents were also sought by the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe.Later we meet many of Mr. Shulman’s prosperous colleagues and supporters still living: Frank Gehry (who says Mr. Shulman got him his first client), Ed Ruscha, Tom Ford, the actress Kelly Lynch and the screenwriter Mitch Glazer. At times it seems as much a tour of well-to-do Los Angeles and Palm Springs as a portrait of its subject. (An amusing historical montage, which races through the origins of California Modernism, may baffle those uneducated on the subject. But this film is not for them.)Mr. Shulman comes across as buoyant and endearingly confident, cognizant of his place in architectural history. He lived long enough to survive postmodernism, a trend he disdained, and to be the founder of the Julius Shulman Institute at Woodbury University in Burbank, Calif.Although it commends its subject for his environmental concerns, “Visual Acoustics” is not about political causes; it’s about lovely photographs of graceful buildings and those who can afford the real estate. But it does pay proper respect to a deserving artist.VISUAL ACOUSTICSOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Directed by Eric Bricker; written by Mr. Bricker and Phil Ethington; narrated by Dustin Hoffman; directors of photography, Aiken Weiss and Dante Spinotti; edited by Charlton McMillan; music by Charlie Campagna; produced by Mr. Bricker and Babette Zilch; released by Arthouse Films.

Bouncing on the dance floor like a lead balloon, this heaving blob of a character, known as Sugar Bear, opens a gaping fissure with each collision and ends up squashing a bystander flatter than a pancake.A loan shark and drug lord with a cuddly name, Sugar Bear spends his days stuffing his face with Krispy Kreme doughnuts and pumpkin pie, a package of sugar by his side. Mr. Grier ultimately steals the movie with a tour-de-force parody of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” from “Dreamgirls,”  in which “You’re gonna love me” becomes “You’re gonna feed me.”In a Zac Efron caricature that’s almost as funny, the decidedly un-macho son (Brennan Hillard) of the basketball coach at Music High School, where much of the movie takes place, flounces happily into the street, trailed by admiring fellow students as he crows a version of “Fame” whose title exclamation has been changed to “Gay!”Between production numbers, “Dance Flick,” directed by Damien Dante Wayans from a screenplay he wrote with four other members of the Wayans clan (Keenen Ivory, Shawn, Marlon and Craig), pieces together a ridiculous generic story. Like every other Wayans family farce, it has a 10-second attention span.In the early scenes the plans of its heroine, Megan (Shoshana Bush), a ferociously ambitious ballet hopeful, are interrupted by a car crash that kills her mother on the way to a Juilliard audition. Even this tragedy (which is later re-enacted as a comic ballet) is played for laughs, as rescue workers ignore the mother trapped under the vehicle and greedily scoop up leaking gasoline.“Dance Flick” offers a nonstop barrage of jokes and quotations from movies and television that are all the funnier if you know the sources, although familiarity is not required. Besides “Dreamgirls” and “High School Musical,” references include “Flashdance,” “Step Up,” “Save the Last Dance,” “You Got Served,” “Stomp the Yard,” “Black Snake Moan,” “Twilight,” “Hairspray” and Heather Mills in “Dancing With the Stars.”The Wayans style, established in the first two “Scary Movies,” relies on the density of jokes that push the acceptable bounds of taste to keep the comedy aloft. A free-for-all of  gross-out humor, “Dance Flick” lets racial and sexual jokes fly. Amy Sedaris is especially funny as the school’s tart-tongued dance teacher, who has a prominent anatomical abnormality. The drama teacher, Mr. Moody (Marlon Wayans), teaches his male acting students to react by punching them hard in the face or kissing them full on the mouth.Megan auditions for Juilliard, writhing to Rick James’s “Super Freak,” which is not exactly what the judges had expected. She eventually lands in Music High School, where she is befriended by Charity (Essence Atkins), a single mother who blithely stashes her infant in her locker during school hours. The child’s father, Baby Daddy (Shawn Wayans), appears now and then and generously provides a snapshot of himself so his son can see his face every morning. Megan begins a fraught romance with Charity’s brother, Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.), a leader of a dance crew that is in debt to the villainous Sugar Bear.The cramming together of so much potentially offensive humor has a reverse effect. In a watchdog culture where candid remarks and clothing choices are continually weighed on the Internet as to whether so-and-so or such-and-such is going too far, “Dance Flick” exhales the rank humidity accumulated in a climate of obsessive caution. Its belly laughs leave you feeling liberated and not guilty; I repeat, not guilty.“Dance Flick” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). For all its off-color humor, it is very careful to stay within limits.

That rural town was light-years away from the Manhattan home of the CBS studio, where Orson Welles was retelling H. G. Wells’s novel “The War of the Worlds” in an infamous radio production on Oct. 30, 1938. Those unaware that the broadcast was a work of fiction fell for Wells’s story of an alien invasion. Fear that it was real quickly set off a panic.In Jody Lambert’s lighthearted comedy “Brave New Jersey” panic is positive, pushing people to say or do things they may have never done under ordinary circumstances. Out of the ensuing chaos, the town’s bashful mayor (Tony Hale, from “Veep”) is forced to assert himself, and a pastor’s faith is challenged, as is the relationship between a schoolteacher and her new fiancé.Through its many cheerful characters, “Brave New Jersey” emanates an upbeat attitude of a James Stewart kind. With its warm filters and costumes, the movie emulates a period film, but its sharp digital cinematography is at odds with its softer, vintage aesthetic.Mr. Lambert, who wrote the screenplay with Michael Dowling, aims for a modest, old-fashioned yarn about a time when people believed in the news media. Even when word gets out that the Martian invasion announcement was just part of a radio show, not everyone listens as intently as they did to the original radio program and gossip. The film’s narrative simplicity can be charming or frustrating, depending on your feelings about awkward dialogue and overreacting actors.",0,14105.0,,1

Please Help.,"Here’s the pitch: A child with brain cancer writes letters to God and thereby touches the heart of an embittered, hard-drinking postal carrier. Even an untrained eye can see right away that a story with that much emotion in its central plotline would require restraint and subtlety to be brought credibly to the screen.Restraint and subtlety, alas, were not in the arsenal of the filmmakers behind “Letters to God,” a Christian-theme movie that opened on Friday and is loosely based on the story of Tyler Doughtie, whose father, Patrick, helped write and direct the drama. Tanner Maguire plays the impossibly beatific Tyler; Jeffrey S. S. Johnson is the mailman; and Robyn Lively is the boy’s widowed mother.Mr. Johnson and Ms. Lively are both pretty good, and with a more nuanced approach could have made this a powerful film. But the movie seems interested only in pushing every button in sight as quickly as possible: school bullying, alcoholism, sibling neglect, absentee fatherhood, thrilling soccer game, triumphant stage performance and on and on.There is a genuine issue in the story that cries out for exploration: how do people of faith deal with inexplicable adversity, beyond a vacant-eyed “It’s God’s will”?The filmmakers show that they know that this issue exists, because in the movie’s strongest scene, Ms. Lively’s character voices it. (“I just wish everyone would stop quoting the Bible to me,” she barks at her mother. “It’s not curing my son.”) But the film then races on, as if afraid of the challenge of going deeper; there’s another button waiting to be pushed up ahead.“Letters to God” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested) because of some potentially upsetting hospital scenes.",0,1121000.0,2848587.0,0

O. SCOTT,"A Guy, His Psychic and a Jealous Ghost","For what it is — a romantic comedy about the rivalry between a jealous ghost and a flaky psychic for the love of a veterinarian — “Over Her Dead Body” is not bad. Eva Longoria Parker, as Kate, the ghost, represents the control-freak/ice-queen end of the female comedic spectrum pretty well, while Lake Bell as Ashley, the psychic, is perfectly lovely on the sweet, scatterbrained end. In the middle is Henry the vet, played by the winningly smirky Paul Rudd, and there are sidekicks drawn from the usual storeroom: the kooky sister (Lindsay Sloane) and the gay male best friend (Jason Biggs).There is no question that this movie, the first feature directed by Jeff Lowell, whose screenwriting credits include “John Tucker Must Die,” could be much worse. But it also could have been, with a little more effort, a lot better. The cast members are talented and game, but they struggle with some borderline-incompetent direction and a series of humorous situations that are less than fresh. I mean, sure, it’s always hilarious when a beautiful woman is squirted in the chest with mustard, or when Mr. Biggs’s arm catches on fire. But an extended bout of flatulence and a dessert-flambéing mishap don’t really yield big laughs. For good measure, there’s also an elderly priest and an overweight dog.Near the end the guy rushes to the airport to catch the girl. This stunning plot development seems to have been designed either to elicit sympathy for the striking writers by giving a foretaste of the inferno of cliché into which their continued absence will plunge us all, or else to undermine that sympathy with a brazen display of hackdom. But maybe I should give Mr. Lowell a few points for originality, since this is to my knowledge the first rush-to-the-airport climax to feature a talking parrot riding in a taxi.And I liked Ms. Longoria Parker, in a curve-hugging white dress, as the desperate housewife from hell. Or whatever zone of the afterlife Kate arrives at after an errant ice sculpture fatally disrupts her wedding to Henry. Possessive and controlling even in death, she tries to keep Ashley away from her erstwhile man through a campaign of annoyingness rather like the one Reese Witherspoon used against Mark Ruffalo in the jealous-ghost romantic comedy “Just Like Heaven.”Ashley fights back rather half-heartedly, and the whole movie feels lazy and underdeveloped, in spite of the best efforts of the actors. Mr. Biggs, victim of a preposterous and unfunny plot twist, lends his knack for ungainly physical comedy, but Mr. Rudd is stranded in his own sarcasm. Ms. Bell works hardest of all and proves to be thoroughly charming in what amounts (I hope) to an audition for a better movie sometime in the near future.“Over Her Dead Body” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

(Bad Idea!)","In “Get Out,” an exhilaratingly smart and scary freakout about a black man in a white nightmare, the laughs come easily and then go in for the kill. The writer and director, Jordan Peele (of the comedy sketch show “Key & Peele”), knows how to make shadowy streets into menacing ones and turn silences into warnings from the abyss. His greatest stroke in “Get Out,” though, is to have hitched these genre elements to an evil that isn’t obscured by a hockey mask, but instead throws open its arms with a warm smile while enthusiastically (and strangely) expressing its love for President Obama.Those arms and smiles all but engulf Chris (the British actor Daniel Kaluuya, going deep in a breakthrough performance), a photographer with a sweet pad, adorable dog and equally frisky, adoring girlfriend, Rose (a perfectly cast Allison Williams, from the HBO show “Girls”). The story opens with them preparing for a long weekend with her parents. “Do they know I’m black?” Chris gently asks. They don’t, but Rose assures him not to worry, and off they go into the countryside and narrative complications. Mr. Peele, making his feature debut, sets a cozy, innocuous scene complete with coos and loving glances, a tranquillity that shatters with an eerily inopportune deer crossing.By the time Chris and Rose pull up to her parents’ house — a stately brick building with imposing white columns and rocking chairs on the front porch — ripples of unease have disturbed the calm. The nicer Rose’s parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), behave, the greater the ripples. They don’t blink at him or his race (Ms. Keener is a virtuoso of the deadeye stare), but instead adopt the forced geniality of people who seem anxious to hide their discomfort. Missy’s the watchful one, while the voluble Dean cozies up to Chris, dropping embarrassing slang and relating an odd story about Jesse Owens, the black Olympian who shocked Hitler.ImageMr. Kaluuya in “Get Out.”CreditUniversal PicturesMr. Peele is best known for his work with Keegan-Michael Key on their titular comedy sketch show, where politics mixed freely with the laughs. Together they starred in the 2016 comedy “Keanu,” a lampoon of action cinema that was a (slack) piece with the movie love that was a mainstay of their show. In one memorable bit from the show, heckling cinephiles voice their complaints (“this movie has an inconsistent visual language!”); in another, two friends realize that the reason the zombie hordes aren’t attacking them is they’re flesh-eating racists. “Get Out” expands on, and considerably deepens, a similar idea by turning white racism into disquieting genre shivers.But Mr. Peele is after more than giggles and shocks; he’s taking on 21st-century white racism and its rationales. The opener — a black man talking on a cellphone on an empty suburban street — briskly sets the tone, unsettles the mood and announces Mr. Peele’s way with metaphor. He’s working within a recognizable horror-film framework here (the darkness, the stillness), so it’s not surprising when a car abruptly pulls up and begins tailing the man. You may even snicker because you think you’ve seen this flick before. Except that when this man anxiously looks for a way out, the scene grows discordantly disturbing because you may, as I did, flash on Trayvon Martin.It’s a jarring moment that might have been catastrophic for the movie if Mr. Peele didn’t quickly yank you back into its fiction. (He’s got great timing, no surprise.) There’s relief when the offscreen world recedes just then. Yet part of what makes “Get Out” both exciting and genuinely unsettling is how real life keeps asserting itself, scene after scene. Our monsters, Mr. Peele reminds us, are at times as familiar as the neighborhood watch; one person’s fiction, after all, is another’s true-life horror story. ” For his part, Chris, separated existentially, chromatically and every other way, spends so much time putting the white world at ease that he can’t recognize the threat coming for him.Mr. Peele knows that threat, plays with it and eviscerates it with jokes and scares, only to top it off messily with full-on Grand Guignol splatter. But some of his finest, most genuinely shocking work is his quietest. One of the best scenes I’ve seen in a long while finds Chris talking with one of the parents’ black servants, a maid, Georgina (a fantastic Betty Gabriel). Chris confesses that he gets nervous when around a lot of white people, an admission that Georgina answers by advancing toward him with a volley of “no, no, no,” cascades of tears and a smile so wide it looks as if it could split her face in two. Something has gotten under her skin and it’s frightening.",1,175428355.0,175484140.0,0

It’s also short, a combination that pretty much gives you all that you could want from a pulp fiction in which Mel Gibson plays a grizzled loner inking skin in a spot called the Missing Link Tattoo. He’s Link, of course; first name John. A former bad, bad man with a wild beard and a deep well of cynicism, John lives in a trailer parked on one of those picturesquely godforsaken southwestern landscapes where John Ford-style homesteaders once circled the wagons. The dream of the Old West dies hard, especially in the movies.Directed by Jean-François Richet, “Blood Father” is based on a novel of the same title by Peter Craig, who shares script credit with Andrea Berloff. The movie is basically one of those rescue missions in which two people end up saving each other, in this case John and his long-missing daughter, Lydia (Erin Moriarty). She reappears in his life after having made a splashy, gory entrance with some heavily armed gangbangers and an excitable number in a suit, Jonah (Diego Luna). Things go south, as they must, and she high-tails it back to Dad. It’s a tense reunion — John is sober, she snorts powder — if flecked with comedy. Their laughs take a timeout when the gangbangers show, guns blazing.Mr. Richet directed the 2005 remake of John Carpenter’s exploitation thriller “Assault on Precinct 13,” which in turn was modeled on Howard Hawks’s “Rio Bravo.” Mr. Richet clearly loves this hard-boiled material as much as he does old films. “Blood Father” is a tight, blunt 88 minutes of hard talk, fired bullets and spit-shined genre conventions. In short order it flips into a road movie when John and Lydia are forced to flee, a narrative turn that allows Mr. Richet to root around in a sandbox filled with the usual classic playthings: cool rides, ribbons of lost highway, the motel that becomes a deathtrap, the spooky deserts haunted by the ghosts of film cowboys and Indians past.Mr. Gibson makes a persuasive derelict John Wayne with a loose, energetic performance, finely tuned comic timing and an amused, self-aware “Lethal Weapon” glint. As the guns come out, that glint grows harder and Mr. Gibson’s body almost seems to as well, as if he were developing muscle as needed. It’s such a strong performance that in moments, despite Mr. Richet’s attention to detail — the shiny chrome, the desperados, the pretty sun-kissed color — the movie all but fades, leaving only Mr. Gibson. Ms. Moriarty works well as the little lost girl who may not want to be found, and there’s nice support from William H. Macy, but “Blood Father” is Mr. Gibson’s show.“Blood Father” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bullets and blood. Running time: 1 hour 28 minutes.",0,,,1

The result is the cinematic equivalent of combining every paint color on a canvas: a murky mess.When Jamie (Elizabeth Rice), a Chicago reporter, learns that Anna, her sister, has died in Singapore, she heads there to investigate. The police show her a video of Anna asphyxiating herself. But Jamie soon finds that Anna may have encountered a demonic entity in her home, which might also threaten Anna’s young daughter, Katie (Adina Herz). As it happens, Anna’s house has a history of family homicide. And other grisly deaths around the city seem connected as well.I could recite a list of the hoary supernatural-invasion clichés on parade here, but suffice it to say that the only innovations appear to be garments flying off an outdoor clothesline and, um, a suspicious deep-sea-diving helmet.Through two investigating priests (Colin Borgonon and Adrian Pang), we learn that a plot is brewing to resurrect the biblical Tower of Babel; evidently, binary code has become the one planetary language that the Bible warned us against. And a monster, the leviathan, is on its way, too. It all leads to the possession of Katie and a demon-eviction ceremony featuring, yes, the spinning-head effect straight out of “The Exorcist.”“If you never believed in God, now’s the time you do,” a priest says.

If his unadorned high-art allusions can make him an acquired taste, his latest farce, “The Son of Joseph,” is his most accessible film since “The Living World,” from 2003.Divided into five sections, each named after a biblical episode, “The Son of Joseph” is a fanciful repackaging of the Nativity (the media notes, perhaps seizing on Hollywood’s zest for recycling, call it a “reboot”): A sullen teenager, Vincent (Victor Ezenfis), raised by a nurse (Natacha Régnier), learns his father is a vain publisher, Oscar (Mathieu Amalric), who can’t even keep track of how many children he has.Stalking Oscar at his hotel office (Mr. Green appears as the concierge), Vincent meets Joseph (Fabrizio Rongione), Oscar’s kind, disinherited brother. Joseph accompanies Vincent to the Louvre and teaches him about art and life. He may even be a match for Vincent’s mother. (Her name, it turns out, is Marie.)Mr. Green’s taste for frontal compositions and clipped editing sometimes recalls the filmmaker Robert Bresson, although Bresson wasn’t known for his throwaway humor. (Probably not many teenagers’ bedrooms include replicas of Caravaggio’s “The Sacrifice of Isaac,” and Maria de Medeiros has a funny role as a perpetually confused literary critic.)“The Son of Joseph” can be trying in its whimsy, yet it builds to a lovely finale that evokes the Bible, the French Resistance and the surreal.",1,28753.0,,1

From the moment Moores (Linus Roache), an arrogant British planter in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala, hands a gun to his loyal manservant T. K. (Rahul Bose), you can be certain that the weapon will be discharged and lives destroyed.Moores has a grand scheme to build a road into the jungle, the better to transport spices for export, but it must be completed before the monsoon season. Some of the most visually striking scenes in the lavish, beautifully photographed film, which was made on location in Kerala, show a virtual army of laborers from the nearby village hacking down trees and digging the road. It isn’t quite slave labor, but almost.“Before the Rains” is adapted from “Red Roofs,” the longest of three unrelated stories in the Israeli director Dany  Verete’s 2002 film, “Yellow Asphalt,” which explored the collision of modern customs and tribal traditions in contemporary Israel. In that movie a wealthy Jewish farmer who has an affair with his Bedouin housekeeper forces his assistant, a Bedouin tribesman, to initiate drastic damage control once the relationship is detected. With a screenplay by Cathy Rabin, “Before the Rains” has been to moved to colonial India in 1937. The transition from one culture to another is seamless.Moores, played by Mr. Roache with a cunning charm that masks an authoritarian severity, is carrying on a passionate affair with his housekeeper Sajani (Nandita Das), a beautiful, naïve woman who commutes from the village to work at his nearby ranch. One afternoon they are accidentally spied making love at a waterfall by two young boys from the village, who report seeing Sajani with an unidentified man.When her husband, Rajat (Lal Paul), interrogates her, Sajani’s evasive replies drive him into a fury and he savagely beats her, which under tribal law is within his rights. Since Moores’s wife, Laura (Jennifer Ehle), has recently arrived from England with their son Peter (Leopold Benedict), Sajani has already become someone to be kept hidden, although Moores still swears he loves her.But when Sajani shows up wounded at his door in the middle of the night, he insists she leave as soon as possible. The next day he hands her money and entrusts her to T. K., who is ordered to make sure that she leaves. Before departing, she asks Moores one last time if he loves her, and after a pause, he coldly answers no.“Before the Rains” doesn’t dawdle in sentimentality. As much as you sympathize with Sajani’s hopeless plight —  she is a pariah with nowhere to go —  the film is a dispassionate study of how power, when threatened, ruthlessly exercises its prerogatives. For as long as he can get away with it, Moores  lies to his wife about the reasons for the escalating turmoil. Nowadays it’s called stonewalling.The movie’s most compelling figure is the unfailingly loyal T. K., who is instructed to violate native  customs  in a desperate cover-up. A stoic, taciturn man who loves his boss too much, he is a lost soul who has foolishly imagined he could keep one foot in the tribal world and the other in the modern.But for all his ability at navigating between the two, T. K. is as naïve in his way as Sajani. The movie is too sophisticated to make Moores  an evil caricature. He is simply the embodiment of the kind of power that when endangered reveals its true nature.“Before the Rains” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

That the United States thwarted him is largely because of the black athletes who receive their due in Deborah Riley Draper’s deft and comprehensive documentary “Olympic Pride, American Prejudice.” As the movie makes clear, racial politics played a major role, both domestically and abroad.The film documents the efforts of the N.A.A.C.P. and Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York, among others, to boycott the Games. And the hurdler Tidye Pickett and the sprinter Louise Stokes had reason to stay home, having endured racial indignities at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. But as Ralph Metcalfe Jr., son of the 1932 and ’36 Olympian, puts it on camera, the prevailing attitude was, “Let’s get over there and dust those Germans, who think they’re better than us.”The 18 black athletes, who experienced a celebrity in Berlin denied them in America, took home eight gold medals, four alone for the runner and media darling Jesse Owens. Some returned home to a bleak future; one was reduced to sweeping streets, using his Olympic jacket for warmth.The villain here is Avery Brundage, the United States Olympic Association president, who trusted the Nazis’ vow to include a Jew on their team (they later reneged) and who dropped the American team’s two Jewish members before a track event Hitler attended.Carl Lewis and many other former Olympians testify to the fortitude and accomplishments of their predecessors, whose triumphs on the field portended the civil rights victories of future decades.",0,,,0

The film never comes fully to term, as it were: the visual style is sitcom functional, and even the zippiest jokes fall flat because of poor timing. But, much like the prickly, talented Ms. Fey, it pulls you in with a provocative and, at least in current American movies, unusual mix of female intelligence, awkwardness and chilled-to-the-bone mean.Ms. Fey is of course best known for working in television, on “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock.” Until now her biggest movie role was the uncomfortable but earnest high school math teacher Ms. Norbury in the comedy “Mean Girls,” which she also wrote.  (“You all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores,” Ms. Norbury warns the mean girls and their female prey. “It just makes it O.K. for guys to call you sluts and whores.”) Like a lot of comedies “Mean Girls”  has its devilish cake and eats it too, wagging an unpersuasive finger at the very cruelty it skillfully deploys. Ms. Fey may not want girls to call one another sluts, but she’s all too happy to call them that herself.There’s often a degree of sadism in this kind of comic one-two punch, and while some performers appear to direct the cruelty inward — think of Jerry Lewis and Ben Stiller wringing squirmy, uneasy laughs out of the humiliations rained down on their characters — that doesn’t seem to be Ms. Fey’s style. Certainly it isn’t what she’s called on to do in “Baby Mama,” in which she plays a snappy, sardonic individualist who, much like Ms. Fey herself, works in a male-dominated industry (here, as an executive in an organic grocery chain similar to Whole Foods) and favors the kind of sexy librarian look (high-heeled shoes, low-cut blouses and dark-frame glasses) that signals there’s a hot body to go along with that feverishly smart brain.“Baby Mama,” which was written and directed by the newcomer Michael McCullers, yet another “Saturday Night Live” alumnus, opens with Ms. Fey’s character, Kate Holbrook, eyeballing babies like a hungry wolf. Everyone has a pitter-pattering Tater Tot but Kate, who lives alone in her generically appointed Philadelphia apartment (the film was also shot in New York)  and has few contacts outside her job, extended family and wisecracking doorman, Oscar (Romany Malco). Basically she’s Rhoda with thinner thighs, which I guess means that she’s Mary Richards. But this being 2008 and not the women’s-liberated 1970s, it isn’t enough for Kate to be a swinging single: she wants a baby and she wants it now. Enter Angie Ostrowiski (Ms. Poehler).At 36 Ms. Poehler is at least 10 years too old for the role, as the softly focused close-ups suggest, but she’s a pip. She’s the ball that bounces against Ms. Fey’s formidable wall, a nonstop, joyfully watchable whirligig. Drawn in broad, often crude strokes, Angie is dumber than the usual dumb blonde so beloved of the movies largely because she’s also coded as white trash, a kind of urban Daisy Mae, complete with short shorts, wads of chewing gum and a tag-along buffoon, Carl (Dax Shepard). If Angie works at all, it’s because Ms. Poehler puts a sweet spin on her character’s gaffes, whether she’s yelping in horror at the unfamiliar taste of water or squatting in a sink when nature makes an untimely call.There’s more, though not much, mostly some amusing nonsense from Steve Martin as Kate’s boss, a belligerently New Agey entrepreneur with an unkind ponytail.  Greg Kinnear also shows up now and again as Kate’s inevitable love interest, perhaps so things don’t overheat when Angie moves in. Not that anyone need worry about this female odd couple, given that Ms. Fey, who doesn’t have the acting chops that might invest her character with some personality, has been forced to play it straight and narrow. The close-up medium of television is more forgiving of those comics who tend to stand in the middle of the frame as if they had just been planted. But unlike Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, Ms. Fey doesn’t even have a funny voice.That’s too bad, because she is genuinely funny. And if there’s anything the movies could use it is funny women, especially those who earn laughs by keeping their clothes on and their dignity (more or less) intact. Under the old Hollywood system, the studio boss might have ordered up a dance coach for Ms. Fey, maybe a few lessons on how to walk across a set or move her upper body once in a while. She might not have been able to rip loose as a writer-performer, which makes the idea of her developing a simultaneous on-and-off-screen presence all the more tantalizing. Real funny women — Mae West, Elaine May — come along every few decades, so the timing seems right. But the clock is ticking.“Baby Mama” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Its first-time writer and director, Mark Webber, doesn’t immediately reveal the story’s structure or his intentions: he simply places you among some dozen characters — children and young adults of different colors and with differing economic contexts — without introduction. A young boy buys a soda in one scene, an older boy explains the benefits of a vegan diet in another; one man sells pot while another sells colonics.These are a few  of the souls  finding and losing themselves in a neighborhood in uneasy transition alongside a bohemian wife (Naomie Harris) who steals puffs off blunts in between yoga poses and a poor mother (Rosario Dawson) trying to care for her asthmatic son. In time, themes (financial distress, self-medication, existential isolation) emerge from their lives, and seemingly casual moments begin to take larger shape, much as the dots in a pointillist painting do as you step back from the canvas. Though some  of his visual choices can seem arbitrary (the  long shots tend to feel more like art-cinema tics than formally organic), Mr. Webber, working with the talented cinematographer Patrice Lucien Cochet, persuasively transforms a group of portraits into a group portrait.As the story’s design and Mr. Webber’s intentions come into focus, it becomes evident that this is yet another of those multistranded narratives that have come into vogue again. In some  recent films of this type, most of which come with a veneer of politics and invariably embrace humanism, the characters are connected by a gun (“Babel”), ethnic and racial tensions (“Crash”) and immigration (“Crossing Over”). Yet what binds them isn’t just that they’re all hurting human beings joined by their common pain, but that the filmmaker also wants you to know that they’re all hurting human beings and he feels their pain. Mr. Webber at least offers a solution, as  evidenced by a man who spray-paints the word “revolt” in letters so large they fill the entire frame.Even so, no matter how ostensibly profound their differences, the characters in all these movies end up hoisting the exact same banner for the filmmaker. In the case of “Explicit Ills,” this banner-carrying becomes literalized when the  characters  take to the streets in the final scene during an organized demonstration, a neighborhood of atomized individuals transformed into a coalition of the righteous and united on behalf of medical care, housing and peace. It’s a beautiful message: surely there’s no arguing with “Hey, hey, ho, ho, poverty has got to go!” But there is much to argue with, and much to regret, about a film whose director thinks he needs to drop an anvil on our heads when art would suffice.“Explicit Ills” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Physical violence, recreational drug use and some health-care horror.EXPLICIT ILLSOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Mark Webber; director of photography, Patrice Lucien Cochet; edited by Jay Rabinowitz; music by Khari Mateen; production designer, Michael Grasley; produced by Mr. Webber, Liz Destro and Sol Tryon; released by Peace Arch Entertainment.

963,2010-01-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:10,STEPHEN HOLDEN,"Poet in Exile, Still Gripping His Memories","Late in “A Room and a Half,” a rich, heady fictionalized biography of the exiled Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, the middle-aged Brodsky ruefully reflects in a voice-over about how children are in a desperate hurry to leave the nest.“And one day a man realizes that the nest is gone,” muses the poet (Grigoriy Dityatkovskiy, the oldest of three actors playing Brodsky). “The people who gave him life are dead. He realizes that the only real thing in his life was that nest.”In the movie, unlike real life, Brodsky — who died in New York in 1996 at 55 — magically gets to return to that nest in his final days. Sailing triumphantly up the Neva River, he visits the one-and-a-half-room apartment in St. Petersburg that holds his most cherished memories, and inhales his past.If his regretful observation about leaving home encapsulates the theme of the film, directed by the noted Russian animator and documentarian Andrey Khrzhanovsky, it doesn’t capture its vitality. “A Room and a Half” swirls documentary footage, fictional re-enactments and brilliant, witty animated drawings into a phantasmagoric, playful secondhand memoir.With its unabashedly nostalgic glow, the film belongs to what might be called the “rosebud” school (after “Citizen Kane”) of film biographies that locate the essence of a life in childhood memories. Recurrent images in the film are visual representations of the family’s house cat. The youthful Brodsky (Evgeniy Ogandzhanyan) is shown conversing with his father in meows and later subverting the solemnity of a school anthem sung by a chorus by substituting cat cries for words. He later confides to a friend that he wants to be reincarnated as a cat in Venice.Another image is a crow. In the imagined afterlife, he envisages his loving, rough-hewn parents, Sasha (Sergei Yursky) and Masva (Alisa Freindlich), as two crows perched side by side, observing him. Mr. Yursky and Ms. Freindlich give wonderfully robust performances.Some of the animated sequences — of winged horses and flying sleds, of Brodsky as a farm animal on all fours drawing a cart — suggest Chagall. Other, more elegant pictures — of pianos and other musical instruments flying in formation while framed against the heroic architecture of St. Petersburg — are closer to Magritte’s surrealism.All are connected to specific memories in which the mundane transforms into the visionary. With voice-overs excerpted from Brodsky’s poems and essays, “A Room and a Half” is one Russian artist’s attempt to channel the sensibility of another, using every resource available. Transcending the limitations of conventional screen biography, it wants nothing less than to uncover Brodsky’s poetic essence.Despite its moments of pathos and its expressions of homesickness, “A Room and a Half,” is an uplifting comedy. Like Fellini’s screen reminiscences, it is suffused with a hearty appreciation of the world’s absurdity, along with a hungry appreciation of its beauty. Visually, it is an ode to St. Petersburg (its museums, architecture and statuary are lovingly  photographed), and to the Neva River, which runs by the city.But as factual biography, “A Room and a Half” is sketchy. The film is more interested in the young Brodsky’s early interest in food and sex (stimulated by sculpture and the human form shown in art books) than in the specifics of his education and employment. There is an amusing scene of the adolescent Brodsky being rebuffed by a series of girls as he makes his first fumbling romantic overtures behind a curtain in his parents’ home.Movies also mattered. “For my generation, free thinking starts with Tarzan,” he says, half-jokingly, and we observe a Russian film audience riveted by a clip of Johnny Weissmuller.Later scenes show Brodsky as a young man (Artem Smola) carousing with his peers as they euphorically debate politics and literature. Even in the Soviet Union in the late 1950s and early ’60s, it seems, hope and excitement pervaded the air, at least for the student class.At the same time, Brodsky was precociously aware of the imminent demise of a certain kind of intellectual seriousness in the world. “Our generation is the last that cared for cultural values,” he says prophetically. “We’re the last generation that knows what civilization is.”“A Room and a Half” recreates a scene from the 1964 Soviet trial in which Brodsky was denounced as a militant anti-Socialist sponger and parasite and was sentenced to work for two years in a rural village. After he moves to America in 1972 (he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987 and was named United States poet laureate in 1991), the movie thins a bit. There is a sad little account of his parents’ futile efforts to gain permission to visit their son abroad.As much as he misses his homeland and the city in which he grew up, Brodsky is harshly critical of the culture he left behind. “This is the main tragedy of Russian life: the people’s colossal disrespect for each other, along with contempt and lack of compassion,” he declares.And yet, at least in his dreams, he goes back.A ROOM AND A HALFOpens on Wednesday  in Manhattan.Directed by Andrey Khrzhanovsky; written by Yuriy Arabov and Mr. Khrzhanovsky; director of photography, Vladimir Brylyakov; released by Seagull Films.

Goyer,  “The Unborn” does inflict harm elsewhere, notably on its hapless lead, the wincingly thin Odette Yustman as a hapless  college student, Casey Beldon, who when not prettily posing in her underwear is screaming and screaming and sometimes running from a veritable laundry list of horror staples: creepy little children, creepy little ghost children and lots of creepy and crawly and slimy bugs.Even creepier is Mr. Goyer’s use of the Holocaust as an atmospheric backdrop for his generic tale, which after many detours, shrieks and mild boo moments  finally snakes back — in murky flashback — to Auschwitz and Josef Mengele’s experiments on twins. As it turns out, poor Casey is a twin, a condition that, for generational reasons, has attracted a shape-shifting dybbuk, which in Jewish mythology is the demonic spirit of a dead person that takes possession of the living. This dybbuk, which at its most nifty twists its head 180 degrees Linda Blair-style, can be rooted out only with the help of a Holocaust survivor (Jane Alexander, with numbers inked on her arm) and an exorcism performed by an accommodating rabbi (Gary Oldman in a skullcap).Best known for his screenplays, including the first “Blade” movie (he shares a story credit on “The Dark Knight”), Mr. Goyer isn’t without visual or thematic ideas. The use of scores of the shiny, amber-colored potato bugs, also known as Jerusalem crickets, is a nice, shivery touch here, particularly when they are scuttling toward Casey and her wide-open, yowling mouth. And the dog with the twisted head could star in its own hound-of-hell sequel.Yet the film teeters so perilously and routinely at the edge of camp, both with some of its casting choices and some unfortunate dialogue (the repeated warning that “Jumby wants to be born now”), that it’s hard to know if Mr. Goyer wants to make us howl with fear or laughter.“The Unborn” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

SCOTT,"The Ghost Down the Hall Is Scary in Spanish, Too","“The Orphanage,” a diverting, overwrought ghost story from Spain, relies on basic and durable horror movie techniques. Give a competent director a gliding camera, creepy music and a dim hallway lined with doors, and a decent scare is likely to follow. No matter how many times you have seen similar tricks, the sudden apparition of a child at the end of that hall — especially a child in a weird, anachronistic costume — is likely to make you jump a little in your seat. So when a distraught Laura (Belén Rueda) stumbles down the corridor and comes face to face with a boy whose shorts and knee socks are accessorized by a burlap sack covering his face, you are likely to be nearly as terrified as she is.Even though “The Orphanage” is Juan Antonio Bayona’s first feature film, there is no doubting his skill. But like his patron Guillermo del Toro (who is both producer and “presenter” of this movie), Mr. Bayona is interested in using the horror genre to explore emotions beyond mere fright. Though there are plenty of sudden jolts and eerie atmospherics, “The Orphanage” is ultimately concerned with grief, remorse and maternal longing.As a rule, if these emotions are credible, the lapses of logic and plausibility that haunt nearly every exercise in supernatural cinema will melt away. Metaphysical leaps can be forgiven if the underlying melodramatic architecture is sound; this is why no one pushes too hard against the premises of “The Sixth Sense” or “The Others,” two movies whose blending of the creepy with the weepy “The Orphanage” recalls.Most of the ingredients are present: a sensitive mother (Ms. Rueda); an angelic, endangered child (Roger Príncep); and a spooky house in the middle of nowhere. The child, Simón, has been adopted by Laura and her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), who have the perfectly sensible idea of moving to the orphanage where Laura grew up and turning it into a home for sick children. What could possibly go wrong?But then Simón starts talking about imaginary friends, in particular one named Tomás, and a sinister old lady shows up claiming to be a social worker. And before you know it, Geraldine Chaplin, the honorary fairy godmother of Spanish cinema, stops by to lead a séance.I won’t say what she sees, since I don’t want to spoil any surprises. The twists in Sergio G. Sánchez’s script, though fairly conventional in themselves, are deftly executed by Mr. Bayona.But in spite of his agility, and the sincerity of Ms. Rueda’s performance, “The Orphanage” never quite achieves the intensity it is clearly aiming for. You experience an occasional shudder, but not the deep, resonant unease that makes for a truly memorable nightmare.“The Orphanage” is rated R (Under 17 requires an accompanying parent or adult guardian). Its violence is more cruel than graphic, but potentially upsetting all the same.THE ORPHANAGEOpens in Manhattan on Friday.Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona; written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) by Sergio G.

How best to discourage young people from this kind of thoughtless cruelty?

What really gets their attention, though, is that he seems to know everything about them, including what they had been doing only moments earlier. Soon he’s feeding them video that shows he is also menacing their loved ones, including Sam’s girlfriend, Peyton (Bella Dayne), the only character here you might remotely care about.The writer, Joe Johnson, and directors, Damien Macé and Alexis Wajsbrot, have a few surprises, but not enough to make this anything other than a formulaic story of teenagers behaving badly and getting what’s coming to them.",0,,,0

But — surprise — the fifth “Transformers” movie, “The Last Knight,” is far from the worst in this continuing experiment in noisy nonsense based on Hasbro toys. That is thanks largely to two words: Anthony Hopkins.What Mr. Hopkins, a knighted Emmy and Oscar winner, is doing in a “Transformers” movie is unclear, but he brings a goofy dignity to the enterprise that elevates this chapter over its recent brethren. The storytelling is also an upgrade. For one thing, we finally are given a believable explanation for the purpose of Stonehenge.Mark Wahlberg, who joined the franchise in the fourth film, the unwatchably long and convoluted “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” is back as the scruffy inventor Cade Yeager.As this story opens, Cade is one of the few humans who still has some affection for Autobots, the robotic immigrants from outer space who mean well but whose war with the Decepticons has resulted in all sorts of havoc on Earth. The rest of humanity is still annoyed with them for wrecking a perfectly good city, Chicago, earlier in the franchise.Autobots and Decepticons transform into motor vehicles and other things, a special-effects sight that apparently never grows old for fans of the series. And they have what seems like an ever-changing back story. The one conjured here involves Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin and the Dark Ages, which is where Mr. Hopkins’s character, Edmund Burton, comes in.He’s a sort of keeper of the Arthurian/Transformers legend, and he knows that a long-forecast climactic battle is coming for control of Merlin’s staff, an ancient relic that has formidable powers when wielded by the right person.In this case that person is Viviane (Laura Haddock), a British scholar who is skeptical of the Round Table tales and is also just the right age to be a potential romantic interest for Cade. As for Stonehenge, well, without giving away too much, let’s just say that invaders from space are coming to suck the life out of our planet, and the great monument is not merely the clunkiest calendar ever made.Also in the mix are Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the military man from the previous movies; Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael), Cade’s jokey sidekick; and Izabella (Isabela Moner), the obligatory cute kid. The best touch, though, is Cogman (the voice of Jim Carter), Edmund’s robotic butler, a sort of C-3PO with a temper (as a robot who aims a C-3PO joke at him finds out).This movie series can only wish it had the depth and coherence of the “Star Wars” franchise, but the homage is nice, and Cogman and Edmund have some witty moments, something the more plodding sequels lacked.Michael Bay again directs, and he and his writers (Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan are credited with the screenplay, and those three along with Akiva Goldsman with the story) put more humanity and less clanking into this installment. Mr. Bay seems to rein in his tendency for high-speed pursuits and robotic clashes somewhat, and he varies the vroom-vroom car-chase stuff by throwing in a submarine chase.But don’t worry; if for some reason the drawn-out and incoherent battle scenes are what you liked about the earlier films, the climactic one here is still both of those things. The movie is shorter (by about 15 minutes) than the last one, though, and considerably more bearable.",0,130104634.0,130168683.0,1

More unusual, a note tells us that the film doesn’t support or dispute any specific interpretation of ancient Indian civilization. This disclaimer probably isn’t necessary. From its first scenes, the movie, set in 2016 B.C., makes its intentions known: This is a hero’s tale, not history.In those opening scenes, Sarman (the green-eyed pinup Hrithik Roshan) has a David-like victory over an enormous crocodile, whose superior strength is no match for Sarman’s cunning, courage and well-placed trident. All in a day’s work: We soon learn that Sarman is his village’s go-to man in life-threatening crises.Like all good heroes, Sarman is an orphan (he lives with his aunt and uncle). He doesn’t have a lightning bolt on his forehead, but he has a dream — of a unicorn, which is a clear sign of something ominous, as we see in the worried eyes of his aunt and uncle.Our country boy soon goes off to the big city, Mohenjo Daro, a place he is told is ruled by greed. There he partakes of the polyglot marketplace, witnesses injustice, sees magnificent beasts (horses, brought by traders from Bukhara) and meets … a girl, the Chosen One, played by Pooja Hegde. (Chosen for what, you may wonder: her role consists of being fought over by men.)The real Mohenjo Dara, in what is now Pakistan, comes complete with historical mysteries: why was this city abandoned and why did the Indus Valley civilization, which dates from the third millennium B.C., fade? Whoever the residents of Mohenjo Daro were — and that’s not clear — they had “a reverence for the control of water,” as an article in National Geographic says. They had good drainage. And pools.“Mohenjo Daro,” written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, isn’t really interested in how the city worked, or in its ancient bells and whistles.

One exception is Christine, a young woman with  multiple sclerosis who is  played by the French actress Sylvie Testud. Tucked into a wheelchair, her limbs immobile and hands tightly curled, Christine looks around her — at the other visitors, the helpful aides, the strange locale — with a gaze that seems at once incurious and beatific.Situated in southwest France north of the Pyrenees, Lourdes is thought by Roman Catholics to have been where the impoverished 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous saw the Virgin Mary in 1858. She was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933 and by Hollywood a decade later when her story was turned into the 1943 kitsch classic “The Song of Bernadette,” with Jennifer Jones. Millions now visit Lourdes annually to attend services and drink from and bathe in the grotto waters,  thought to have healing powers. It’s been claimed that the water can cure, though, as the Lourdes Web site, lourdes-france.org, puts it: “For a modern mentality, it is difficult to say that something is ‘inexplicable.’ They can only say that it is ‘unexplained.’ ”One of the pleasures of this intelligent, rigorously thoughtful, somewhat sly film is that it takes place in the space between the inexplicable (no explanation is possible) and the unexplained (enlightenment might be around the corner). Its director, Jessica Hausner, an Austrian working here in French, wants to explore  the mysteries of life, not its certainties. One great mystery, of course, is faith itself, how people come to believe what they do and how those beliefs affect not just their thinking and feelings but also their bodies. For Christine, who speaks most profoundly through the eerie quiet of her nearly inert form — and then later through a possibly miraculous physical transformation — belief is inscribed on the body itself.The film, which was shot on location in Lourdes — one scene features Cardinal Roger Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles, leading a prayer service — is largely organized around the rituals of pilgrimage. Christine, who’s closely assisted by a young woman (Léa Seydoux) who feeds and helps dress her, is pushed here and there.  In one scene Christine visits the grotto, her attendant lifting her curled hand to the stone wall. Another time she visits the baths, where grotto water is poured on her head. In between, she eats and sleeps and has encounters with others (including Bruno Todeschini and a very good Elina Löwensohn).  Wherever she goes, a shop selling religious souvenirs can usually be seen in the background.Contrary to expectation, these repeated images of the souvenir shops don’t function as overt critiques, and there’s nothing in the film as crude as an indictment of the commodification of faith. Ms. Hausner, whose earlier titles include “Lovely Rita,” is more interested in the forms that faith takes, in its individual and collective ebbing and flowing. The mesmerizing opening image — a steadily framed and angled overhead shot of a cafeteria — immediately sets her parameters. As the camera holds on the image, men and women, some in wheelchairs, begin to stream in, as if carried along by some unseen force. They’re merely being seated for a meal, but the elevated angle of the shot and the way everyone drifts in together, as if each were part of a single organism, creates a sense of a collective purpose, a unified calling.The few religious conversations in the film mostly take place at the edges of the story, among the other pilgrims, including a few women who serve as something of a humble Greek chorus. Together they help make up a convincing world inhabited by believers and skeptics whose ideas are largely voiced in asides and through their actions. In a wonderfully choreographed bit, a member of the Order of Malta, a religious group, tells a joke in which the Virgin Mary is the (mild) punch line. Meanwhile, in the background, Christine is secretly wheeled out the door  by her roommate, an older woman with a lopsided mouth, Mme. Hartl  (Gilette Barbier),  who seems to think that her own fate is tied to the handicapped woman.What happens to Christine is mystifying, simultaneously  (as they say at Lourdes) inexplicable and unexplained. Ms. Testud, a tiny actress with an often oversize and ferocious screen presence, delivers a minutely detailed performance that telegraphs a world with a thrust of her chin, a widening of her eyes. Save for the last astonishing shot of Christine’s face — now a whirlwind of expressive feeling — Ms. Testud keeps her performance generally muted, perhaps to help safeguard Ms. Hausner’s secrets. There is, after all, so much that we can’t and don’t know. As one woman says at the end of the film, during a short discussion of God, we do not know who’s in charge. And then this same woman asks a question that puts her spiritual question into comic relief: what, she wonders, is for dessert? Mysteries, as Ms. Hausner attests, abound.LOURDESOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Jessica Hausner; director of photography, Martin Gschlacht; edited by Karina Ressler; production designer, Katharina Wöppermann; produced by Mr. Gschlacht, Philippe Bober and Susanne Marian; released by Palisades Tartan.

For a while, this slow-burn approach by the writer and director, Simon Stone, works: Stabilized by mostly unimpeachable performances, the movie hugs the rails of credibility more tightly than its melodramatic material deserves.Set in a declining Australian logging town, the drama swirls around Christian (Paul Schneider), a grumpy prodigal son. Returning home after 15 years in the United States, Christian is a newly sober drunk dragging an arsenal of anger and resentment. Its object is his father, Henry (Geoffrey Rush), owner of the town’s recently shuttered sawmill and imminent bridegroom to his significantly younger and absurdly gorgeous housekeeper (Anna Torv).Separated from his long-suffering wife, Christian is made even grumpier by the marital happiness of an old school friend, Oliver (Ewen Leslie, terrific), whose familial contentment acts as a goad. Devoted to his wife and teenage daughter (Miranda Otto and a wonderfully expressive Odessa Young), Oliver, with his energy and positivity, is unprotected from Christian’s vindictiveness; he’s a mirror that Christian can’t wait to crack.Reworking his stage adaptation of Ibsen’s play — a study of weaponized truth — Mr. Stone concocts a predictable stew of ancient transgressions and undeserved recriminations. The characters don’t have conversations so much as helpfully recite their back stories, and the long-buried secret is soon so obvious that the movie’s last-act hysteria feels forced and a little ridiculous.Not to mention unearned, as the script barely sketches its characters before expecting us to care about their fates. Henry, in particular, is an indistinct patriarch whose charms, if he has any, remain hidden. And the great Sam Neill, as Oliver’s father, brings quite astonishing nuance to a role that requires him to do little more than care for injured wildlife.Picking up the slack, the director of photography, Andrew Commis, communicates despair through melancholy tracking shots of lonely woods and isolated homesteads, boarded-up businesses and packing-up families. But the intimacy needed for the tragedy to resonate is mostly lacking, and Mr. Schneider is unable to make Christian more than an instrument of combustion: Having clumsily lighted the movie’s fuse, he slides into the wings. By ensuring that everyone is as miserable as he is, he proves far more reprehensible than any of the people whose lives he has so callously ruined.",0,26376.0,,0

An aspiring master of the universe who works at the Miami headquarters of a food-processing giant, Lucy is dispatched to an underperforming branch in New Ulm, Minn.,   to oversee slash-and-burn operations. After a few minutes of listening to her running off at the mouth, you may never again want to hear “dialogue” used as a verb.But the good citizens of New Ulm, including the hunky local union representative, Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.), will have none of her highfalutin double talk. In the movie, directed by Jonas Elmer from a screenplay by Kenneth Rance and C. Jay Cox, they thaw her frozen heart with tapioca, home baking and handmade valentines. As she warms to Ted, a bearded widower with a 13-year-old daughter, she even loses her contempt for men who drink beer.The story contains the nub of a workable concept. What could be more pertinent than a yarn in which an arrogant, number-crunching city slicker regains her humanity when faced with decent, hard-working everyday folks in the provinces? But “New In Town” has no idea of  how to play its cards. From their regional accents to their cutesy-poo vocabulary (lots of okey-dokeys), the Minnesotans whom Lucy encounters are ludicrous parodies of the characters in “Fargo.”  You feel as if you are watching creatures more exotic than Snow White’s seven dwarfs.In particular Lucy’s tapioca-obsessed secretary, Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), acts as though she had been instructed to exponentially multiply the mannerisms of Frances McDormand’s police officer in “Fargo.”  Playing Stu Kopenhafer, the plant manager whom Lucy summarily fires, J. K. Simmons —  outfitted in what appears to be a modified fat suit —  struggles to maintain some dignity.The calm, all-forgiving Ted, whom  Lucy has repeatedly insulted, comes to her rescue after she swerves into a snowdrift to avoid hitting a cow. During a crow-hunting expedition  she accidentally shoots him in the buttocks, and the next day the smirking workers show up  at the plant wearing targets on their backsides. That’s about as witty as “New  in Town” gets.Lucy, for her part, brings a little Miami sophistication to New Ulm. She supervises a makeover for Ted’s daughter on the eve of a school dance. Just as the plant is about to be closed, she comes up with an emergency rescue plan that involves Blanche’s secret recipe for tapioca. The movie doesn’t bother to show how the plan is executed in record time.Watching Ms. Zellweger’s joyless performance, you have to wonder what happened to this formerly charming actress who not so long ago seemed on the verge of becoming a softer, more vulnerable  Shirley MacLaine. As a corporate climber, her edge is all in her clacking heels, not in her bland performance. She is equally unconvincing as a cozy, born-again everyday person with a sense of community responsibility. And where is her most appealing mannerism, her dimpled smile? In a performance that operates as if on automatic pilot, it has faded away.“New in Town” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Wearing flowing black robes, a  bonnet  that squats on her head like an upside-down Easter basket and the kind of  spectacles Mr. Pickwick probably wore to read his papers, Ms. Streep blows in like a storm, shaking up the story’s reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy. The performance may make no sense in the context of the rest of the film, but it is — forgive me, Father — gratifying nunsense.Although the play, which pivots on accusations of child molestation, was first staged  in 2004 —  two years after the Roman Catholic Church  sex-abuse scandals erupted in America —  it unfolds at a  historical remove in 1964. Sister Aloysius (Ms. Streep), the principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx, comes to suspect that her supervisor, Father Flynn (a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest or worse in one of their charges, Donald (Joseph Foster II), the school’s first and only black student. Shored up by the tentative suspicions of a younger nun, Sister James (an unsteady Amy Adams), Sister Aloysius begins circling Father Flynn, going in for the kill. Sister James has doubts. Sister Aloysius has, well, none.As its title announces, “Doubt” isn’t about certainty, but ambiguity, that no man’s land between right and wrong, black and white. This gray zone paradoxically can be  easier to grapple with on the stage, where ideas sometimes range more freely because they are not tethered to representations of the real world. Mainstream moviemaking, with its commercial directives and slavish attachment to narrative codes, by contrast, isn’t particularly hospitable to ambiguity. It insists on clear parameters, tidy endings, easy answers and a world divided into heroes and villains, which may help explain why Mr. Shanley’s film feels caught between two mediums and why Ms. Streep appears to be in a Gothic horror thriller while everyone else looks and sounds closer to life or at least dramatic realism.Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, “Doubt” essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach. So does Father Flynn, a character who for a long stretch appears above reproach: a good, caring, forward-thinking man whose only crime seems to be tolerance. When he suggests that the school add a secular song to its Christmas lineup as a way of reaching out to the community, Sister Aloysius reacts as if he had suggested  human sacrifice instead. That he seems to embody the spirit of reform handed down by Second Vatican Council, which ended in 1965,  makes him all the more sympathetic.Directing from his own script, Mr. Shanley chips away at this sympathy, pulling the story and your feelings this way and that. One of the most eccentric moments in the film occurs when Father Flynn, after admonishing some male students about their dirty fingernails, shows off his long, carefully manicured nails. Mr. Shanley complicates this feeling of gender ambiguity   later when Father Flynn, having gone to Sister Aloysius’s office for a meeting, sits behind her desk without asking permission, an assertion of power that opens a fissure in his easygoing facade and says more about the church and gender than any of their increasingly heated exchanges. Mostly, though, the characters talk, and Mr. Shanley throws a frame around  their heads.Words make the world go ’round  here through repetitions, indirection, allusion as well as a cunning deployment of the barely said and the flat-out unspeakable. (The word “pedophilia” is never uttered.) When Sister James tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn has “taken an interest” in Donald, the words reverberate like a struck bell. Later, when Donald’s mother (Viola Davis, shaking the film up with a few extravagantly mucousy minutes) explains to Sister Aloysius why she wants to keep her son at school, no matter what the truth about the priest, her words resonate partly because they remain veiled by shame, propriety, fear, inequality, pain. What are you telling me? Sister Aloysius demands of the stunned mother, though it’s clear they both know the answer.Mr. Shanley has nothing deep to say about the church and its sex scandals, and he’s still largely using words and more words, despite the tilted camera angles and pretty pictures. But the words are good, solid, at times touching. His work with the actors is generally fine, though it’s a mystery what he thought Ms. Streep, with her wild eyes and an accent as wide as the  Grand Concourse, was doing. Her outsize performance has a whiff of burlesque, but she’s really just operating in a different register from the other actors, who are working in the more naturalistic vein of modern movie realism. She’s a hoot, but she’s also a relief, because, for some of us, worshiping Our Lady of Accents is easier on the soul than doing time in church.“Doubt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Most of the throwaway witticisms drop from the pursed lips of Hugh Grant, playing Paul Morgan, a New York lawyer with Oxonian airs reluctantly transplanted to a tiny Wyoming town as part of the federal witness protection program.After he and his wife, Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker), a high-end New York real-estate broker, accidentally see the murder of an international arms dealer and are spotted by the killer (Michael Kelly), they have no choice but to be whisked away to cowboy country under the pseudonyms Paul and Meryl Foster. Their hosts, the laconic, growly voiced United States Marshal Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott) and his rootin’-tootin’ cowgirl wife, Emma (Mary Steenburgen), teach the effete city slickers the simpler, more wholesome ways of the West. They also show these spoiled, high-maintenance neurotics how to have a relationship. Their secret? Just shut up and make it work!The sleeping arrangements in the Morgans’ temporary refuge are dicey because of one major complication: Paul and Meryl have separated. Meryl won’t forgive her husband for a one-night stand, despite his pleading and groveling to be taken back. As she harangues him about his breach of trust, you are acutely aware that the shelf life of Carrie Bradshaw and her knockoffs is on the verge of expiration. Despite Ms. Parker’s strenuous efforts to charm, Meryl comes across as a shrill, self-centered middle-aged nag. Behavior that appeared kooky and cute at 34 seems pathologically immature a decade later.Mr. Grant is more at ease, possibly because of his previous association with Mr. Lawrence, who wrote and directed “Music and Lyrics” and “Two Weeks  Notice,” in which Mr. Grant also starred. In the work of Mr. Lawrence, whose other credits include collaborating on the screenplays of the two “Miss Congeniality” films, you know what you’re getting: comedy with mostly likable, broadly drawn characters; tart, nonthreatening social satire with sharp enough teeth to leave an impression while not breaking the skin; and well-timed, modestly sophisticated repartee.In plunking upscale blue-state urbanites into red-state territory, “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” adroitly avoids condescending to either side. The movie’s sole political reference is its mention of the 14 Democrats in the overwhelmingly Republican town. That statistic is dropped by Wilford Brimley, playing a grouchy geezer at a local cafe who takes offense when Meryl asks him to direct his cigarette smoke away from her table. “We’re not fond of city people telling us how to live,” he grumbles.Once in Wyoming, Meryl, a vegetarian and a member of PETA, finds herself surrounded by stuffed animal heads in a house whose refrigerator is crammed with meat.Emma, a whiz with a shotgun and an ax, jokes that for her the acronym stands for People Eating Tasty Animals.Wyoming nights are so quiet that Paul remarks, “I thought I heard my cells dividing.” Consuming a hearty breakfast of bacon, eggs and pancakes makes him worry that he should have an angiogram. He is pathetically inept at chopping wood. The kickback from shooting a gun sends him to the doctor. Such jokes come with enough regularity that just as the movie seems about to fall asleep, a mild comic jolt wakes it up.“Did You Hear About the Morgans?” belongs more to the Wheelers than to its title characters. Mr. Elliott, 65, is everybody’s senior-cowboy fantasy: the Marlboro man three decades later, still oozing laid-back virility. Ms. Steenburgen’s Emma suggests an older, wiser, more grounded Sarah Palin type, comfortable in her skin and her Western gear.“Did You Hear About the Morgans?” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The jokes are thin, the computer animation is wanting and the inane plot is a series of set pieces strung together.The critters, led by a dour squirrel named Surly (Will Arnett), are in danger of losing their city park home thanks to an egomaniacal mayor (Bobby Moynihan) with a Texan accent who plans to build a shoddy amusement park over the sanctioned greenscape.You don’t need to see the first “Nut Job” movie to follow the sequel’s nonsensical plot and the script’s preference for bottom-shelf puns. The film’s meanspirited tone picks on both creatures and humans, like construction workers for being illiterate, animals almost too dumb to survive and the wicked rich.Apart from Mr. Arnett’s Surly, no other animal gets more than a few scraps of screen time, including Jackie Chan as the leader of a Chinatown mice gang and Bobby Cannavale as a dimwitted pup. Surly’s relationship with his love interest, Andie (Katherine Heigl), plays out like a Goofus and Gallant comic strip in which he does things the easy way while she moralizes about the importance of hard work and coddles Surly through his tantrums.The director Cal Brunker, previously a storyboard artist for “Despicable Me,” does not bring the warmth of that movie to this effort. Mr. Brunker, who wrote the script with five other people, fashions “Nut Job 2” as its own dull amusement park ride, where slapdash animation, a dismal story and a score by Heitor Pereira repeated ad infinitum makes for few thrills.",0,,,1

In the fictional city of Annam, where nearly everyone is on the take, Han (Jung Woo-sung), a detective, casts his lot with the corrupt mayor, Park Sungbae (Hwang Jung-min), who wields violence without mercy from behind a dignified, bespectacled facade.But no sooner has Han successfully pressured a witness into refusing to testify against Park — and framed a drug addict for the accidental death of a fellow cop — than he is co-opted by a prosecutor (Kwak Do-won) who wants audio evidence that will put Park away.The arrangement catches Han in a vise grip between two masters, both ambitious, brutal and happy to lie. The mayor, who at one point offers to cut off his own arm, makes an especially implacable and chilling nemesis. Treating evidence of betrayal almost as a dare, he regards each attempt on his crown as a dual challenge: first to vanquish his enemies, then to spin it into good public relations.Although two uses of the Blind Boys of Alabama’s version of “Way Down in the Hole” may conjure memories of the “The Wire,” this largely diverting potboiler isn’t interested in sociological scope. As the suspense slackens and blood starts spilling nearly to the point of self-parody, it almost seems designed as a test of mettle — for both the filmmakers and the audience.",0,174501.0,,0

O. SCOTT,Convulsions of a Family and an Abandoned Country,"The subjects addressed in “The Betrayal (Nerakhoon),” a documentary by Ellen Kuras, could hardly be more enormous: war, revolution, the abandonment  of a nation and the scattering of its citizens. But the film, though it includes old news clips of the war in Laos and of American presidents discussing that country’s fate, is distinguished by an intimate mood and a lyrical tone. It is quiet, contemplative and impressionistic, which makes the story it has to tell all the more powerful.That story belongs to Thavisouk Phrasavath, who is credited as Ms. Kuras’s co-director and who provides on-camera and voice-over narration. The son of a Laotian military officer who was part of the American-backed government, Mr. Phrasavath and his family fled their homeland not long after the Communist Pathet Lao insurgents came to power in 1975. After Mr. Phrasavath’s father disappeared into a re-education camp —  for a “seminar,” in the chilling local euphemism — Mr. Phrasavath, his mother and most of his sisters and brothers made their way to Thailand and then to the United States, where they were deposited in a tough, gang-ridden section of Brooklyn.Ms. Kuras first met Mr. Phrasavath around that time, and one of the most remarkable aspects of “The Betrayal” is a narrative span rare in documentaries.Film shot almost a quarter-century ago flows into more recent images. Some middle years are missing, giving the film a haunting sense of discontinuity and intensifying the surprise of its unexpected turns. Mr. Phrasavath and his mother seem to age before our eyes, as he grows from a sullen adolescent with big 1980s hair into a sober and contemplative middle-aged man and she is pared down by time into a tough, weary matriarch.A complicated, sometimes tragic chronicle emerges in “The Betrayal,” but the film is driven less by chronology or plot than by the expressive counterpoint of words, music and images. Ms. Kuras, making her debut as a director, has had a long and distinguished career as a cinematographer (her credits range from Tom Kalin’s “Swoon” to Michel Gondry’s “Be Kind Rewind”), and while “The Betrayal” is in some respects a memoir, it is also a work of visual art. The collaboration of the co-directors seems to consist precisely of the synthesis between his memories and her eye.The result is imperfect, but its roughness is entirely consistent with the way the filmmakers understand the traumatic experiences of displacement, loss and deprivation. The title, which at first seems straightforwardly to refer to the American government’s abandonment of its Laotian proxies, takes on deeper, sometimes contradictory meanings as “The Betrayal” (in Lao, “Nerakhoom”) unfolds. It refers to the actions of Mr. Phrasavath’s father, and also, more obliquely, to the loss of cohesion and identity suffered by exiled Laotians as their children drift into violence and materialism.Mr. Phrasavath and Ms. Kuras address these complicated issues, and the feelings they evoke, with a patience and tact that sometimes feels a little too detached. But their purpose, finally, is not to traffic either in despair or easy uplift, but rather to write a film essay that takes account of pain, resilience and the sheer strangeness of recent history.THE BETRAYAL (NERAKHOON)Opens on Friday in Manhattan.Written and directed by Ellen Kuras and Thavisouk Phrasavath; director of photography, Ms. Kuras; edited by Mr. Phrasavath; music by Howard Shore; produced by Ms. Kuras and Flora Fernandez-Marengo; released by Cinema Guild.

Add a daughter (Mr. Garcia’s real-life daughter, Dominik Garcia-Lorido) who’s stripping instead of studying and a teenage son (Ezra Miller) who fantasizes about feeding doughnuts to fat women and you have a household that, even by current comedy standards, strains credulity.But the writer and director, Raymond De Felitta (who made the similar but superior “Two Family House”), is just warming up. Into this dysfunction comes Tony (Steven Strait), a sponsor-seeking parolee and Vince’s long-lost illegitimate son. By this point, anyone unaware that Tony will be the catalyst for a contrived — and supremely noisy — group hug/confessional probably hasn’t been to the multiplex in a very long time.Set in the tiny fishing community at the northern tip of the Bronx, “City Island” is softened by some sweet, low-key moments between Vince and a fellow acting student (a very good Emily Mortimer) and by Mr. Garcia’s embodiment of disappointed middle age. In Vince’s permanently wounded eyes the desire for change is as clear as the movie’s commitment to conformity.“City Island” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Afterward, while admiring handsome German fans with a fellow choir member — “30 years ago, they’d be waving ‘Heil,’” Sephi says — she is confronted by a Polish woman (Katarzyna Gniewkowska) who calls her father, now a gynecologist in Jerusalem, a murderer.Sephi’s sister, Nana (Nelly Tagar), a magazine editor, is eager to investigate. Suddenly, the past is omnipresent. Thomas (Rafael Stachowiak), a West German composer who happens to be the Polish woman’s son, becomes a visiting teacher at Sephi’s Jerusalem music academy, with ambiguous intentions toward her. Nana receives a diagnosis of spleen cancer, which she is convinced is cosmic revenge for a sin their father will not reveal.Expecting a big surprise might be missing the point. Mr. Nesher, who wrote the screenplay, is less interested in twists than in a broad subject, intergenerational reconciliation. (The finale is pointedly set against President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt’s bridge-building address to the Knesset in November 1977.) “Past Life” is a page-turner that transforms into a clarion call: always compelling, but slightly stifled by noble intentions.",0,,,0

By day he performs small repairs in a boutique hotel in San Francisco; by night he inhabits a tiny room with Etienne, his beloved dwarf hamster. Surrounded by elaborate, repurposed-toilet-roll structures created for Etienne’s enjoyment, Richard is a doughy man-child whose adult-movie mustache fails to mask his innocence. So when Etienne is declared terminally ill — in one of the most bizarre veterinary-office scenes in movie history — Richard packs him into his bike basket and sets off to show him the world. Or at least the Northern California coastline.Written and directed by Jeff Mizushima, “Etienne!” is an enormously likable peculiarity, a shambling road trip that effortlessly marries a guileless tone to knowing observations. A series of offbeat encounters — a backpacker-scientist collecting slug slime (Thibault Debaveye); two traveling musicians (Great Northern’s Rachel Stolte and Solon Bixler) with a broken-down van; a pinhole-camera expert (Caveh Zahedi) in need of an assistant — lead Richard finally to Elodie (Megan Harvey), a recent dumpee on a journey of her own.Gliding on peaceful ocean vistas and plaintive indie ballads, whimsical conversations and tinkling French ditties, “Etienne!” encourages us to brake for sunsets and smell the daisies. “Slime is a natural anesthetic,” says the scientist. So is the companionship of a kindred soul, whether blessed with two legs or four.ETIENNE!Opens on Friday  in Dumbo, Brooklyn.Written, directed and edited by Jeff Mizushima; directors of photography, Tim van der Linden, Eric Kim and Mr. Mizushima; music by Mark Bächle; produced by Giacun Caduff, Joel David Moore, Jeremy Boreing and Kurt Schemper; released by Circus Road Films.

981,2017-03-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:26,RACHEL SALTZ,"Review: In ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania,’ Boy Meets Girl (and Learns to Respect Her)","Recent Bollywood movies have tried out, hesitantly and conservatively, versions of the Modern Woman: Heroines can have careers; they can live alone in the big city; they can even (if very rarely) have sex before marriage.But marry, it seems, they must. Shashank Khaitan builds his romantic comedy “Badrinath Ki Dulhania” (“Badrinath’s Bride”) around a self-possessed heroine — Vaidehi (Alia Bhatt), whose dreams may be ill-defined but don’t necessarily include marriage.Vaidehi is up against a lot: The first scenes of “Badrinath” remind us comically, but baldly, that baby boys are still considered assets while girls are liabilities. (Instead of the usual note that no animals were hurt during its filming, this movie starts with a disclaimer about the 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act.)Badrinath (Varun Dhawan), the fellow who falls for Vaidehi — at a wedding, of course — comes from a well-to-do family in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, that practically screams patriarchy. (His mother and sister-in-law are mainly silent; his father is a scowling tyrant with a sadistic streak.) Badrinath may be a notch or two above Vaidehi socially, but as she points out to him, he’s not her equal: She’s smart and ambitious; he’s neither. He is, though, sweet and persistent. Reader, she agrees to marry him.Complications ensue, including a second-act detour to Singapore, where Vaidehi is studying to become an air hostess. (This is the best career Mr. Khaitan could dream up for his heroine?) Badrinath turns up in Singapore, too, and it’s on this non-Indian ground that the movie hammers home its point: A real man is one who respects women, or in his case, learns to. (And, yes, it’s sad that the movie’s simple moral has currency in present-day America as well as in India.)If “Badrinath” ends up being less about female empowerment than about schooling gents on a cardinal rule, its pop comes from Ms. Bhatt. Hindi cinema conventions and Mr. Khaitan’s script may constrict Vaidehi’s options, but Ms. Bhatt cannot be contained. Without ever falling into the clichés of spunky Bollywood heroine, she effortlessly embodies that admirable thing: a modern woman.",0,,,0

Whether it and the movie in general are too intense for younger children is something parents need to ask themselves. A PG-13 rating is sometimes an overreaction to a curse word or two, but here it’s a useful caution.The central human character is a 12-year-old, Conor O’Malley (Lewis MacDougall), who as the movie opens is having one heck of a nightmare: He and his mother (Felicity Jones) are in a churchyard as the ground begins collapsing around them, and she is in danger of being sucked away into an abyss. No subtlety or pussyfooting around here; we soon learn that the mother is fatally ill and in the midst of a drawn-out death.If the opening moments are striking, what comes next is even more so: Conor’s imagination calls forth a monstrous yew tree that talks in the voice of Liam Neeson. It is one impressive cinematic creation, and it leads Conor on a journey intended to help him confront the realities he faces and his innermost thoughts about them.Those realities, by the way, do not merely involve his dying mother. He is being bullied at school. He has issues with his father (Toby Kebbell), who left the family years ago and started another far away. His grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) wants him to come live with her, but he finds her cold and off-putting.That’s a lot to load onto one boy — too much, really. The story (by Patrick Ness, from an idea by Siobhan Dowd) seems to be trying to check every box on the Things That Might Trouble a Child list, when really “dying parent” is quite enough.To “overstuffed” you could also add “overblown.” Yes, children can have vivid imaginations, but Conor’s visions seem almost too big for his preteen head, an inner kiddie landscape as dreamed up by a special-effects studio.That said, the film, directed by J. A. Bayona, certainly dares to be darker and more substantial than the average family movie. The monster, who Conor soon realizes is there to help, not harm him, tells the boy three stories, none of them delivering pat messages or answers. It’s a short course in the complexities and contradictions of life.“There is not always a good guy, Conor O’Malley,” the tree tells him at one point, “nor is there always a bad one.”The goal is to induce Conor to tell his own story — that is, to admit to himself what he really feels and wants. When he finally does — Mr. MacDougall is quite good, by the way — a climactic scene more frightening than all the ones before brings the boy some closure, or at least some understanding of how to cope with a world that can be harsh.It’s a catharsis painted with bold, noisy imagery, one that makes death an overwhelming tsunami. If you prefer to view dying as a natural part of life, a step in a cycle, this film will feel discordant and perhaps counterproductive. But visually it will certainly stick with you, and your children.",0,3730982.0,3740823.0,1

But either way, it’s lovely to watch.This biopic, subtitled “The Courage of Knowledge,” highlights about six years in the life of the great scientist of the title (played by Karolina Gruszka). It starts in 1905 when she and her husband, Pierre (Charles Berling), go to Stockholm to give their Nobel Prize lecture, then moves through his death and toward Marie winning her second Nobel. Those years were eventful, and Ms. Gruszka seems to be in constant, breathless motion, even when only maneuvering around a laboratory.Such continuous activity, and an overcommitment by the film’s director, Marie Noëlle, to stage nearly every frame in what seems to be the utmost flattering angle and pose, sometimes distracts, making it tough to delve into the character’s beautiful mind as she’s either traveling to meet Einstein (Piotr Glowacki) on the beach, having a scandalous affair with the mathematician Paul Langevin (Arieh Worthalter) or trying to overcome the sexism that’s palpably infuriating for being so ever-present.Still, if we don’t always know what drives Curie, we see the determination itself. That’s enough to keep the film moving along. Just as smartly, Ms. Noëlle, who wrote the script with Andrea Stoll, highlights Curie’s success as a result of hard work and personal struggle rather than simple, and stereotypical, “eureka!” moments. There’s a lot of labor and conflict shown here, and rarely have they looked so good.",0,,,1
984,2008-07-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:08,A. O. SCOTT,"Forge a Unity of Purpose, Then Conquer the World","“Mongol” — or, as I prefer to think of it, “Genghis Khan: The Early Years” — is a big, ponderous epic, its beautifully composed landscape shots punctuated by thundering hooves and bloody, slow-motion battle sequences.Directed by the protean and prolific Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov (who wrote the script with Arif Aliyev), it is, among other things, a stubborn defense of old-fashioned, grand-scale moviemaking. (It is also an old-style international co-production financed by some fairly new players in world cinema, including companies in Kazakhstan and Mongolia.) Without irony or digital effects “Mongol,” the first installment in a planned trilogy, tells the story of a solitary man’s rise to a position of great power.Mr. Bodrov follows his hero, a young warrior named Temudgin (played by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano), from boyhood to the eve of world conquest in 1206, when he would become the Genghis Khan known and feared by millions. There are some gaps in the narrative, but the portrait that emerges is of a reformer and a unifier, a leader who consolidates rival tribes and factions and who modernizes some of the traditional Mongol ways.At his side in these efforts are a few allies and, above all, his wife, Borte (Khulan Chuluun), to whom he is betrothed as a child and to whom he remains loyal in spite of many setbacks and temptations. When she is kidnapped by marauding Merkits,  Temudgin musters a small army to bring her back, a mission that astonishes his friend Jamukha (Honglei Sun). “What Mongol ever went to war for a woman?” he wonders.Jamukha, Temudgin’s blood brother and semicomic sidekick, eventually becomes his enemy for reasons that are somewhat obscured in the fog of Mongol custom and legend. But the two of them are nicely matched foils, with Jamukha’s levity and braggadocio dispelling some of the sober gloom that gathers around his friend.“Mongol” moves solemnly across the decades, accumulating rich ethnographic detail and enough dramatic intrigue to sustain a viewer’s interest through the slower stretches. While it takes a sympathetic view of  young Genghis Khan — whose name, in the West, is a synonym for rapacity — it does not force him into conformity with modern sensibilities. His world feels authentically raw and refreshingly archaic, and also strangely beautiful.MONGOLOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Sergei Bodrov; written by Arif Aliyev and Mr. Bodrov; directors of photography, Sergey Trofimov and Rogier Stoffers; edited by Zach Staenberg and Valdis Oskarsdottir; music by Tuomas Kantelinen; production designer, Dashi Namdakov; stunt choreography by Zhaidarbek Kunguzhinov and Jung Doo Hong; produced by Sergey Selyanov, Mr. Bodrov and Anton Melnik; released by Picturehouse.

O. SCOTT,"Back to the ’80s, for Assorted Hookups in a Wasteland of Privilege","Graham (Jon Foster) and Martin (Austin Nichols) are sitting in a Porsche parked in the hills overlooking Los Angeles. Graham is doing a lot of coke. Martin has been doing Graham’s mom, and also Graham’s girlfriend, Christie (Amber Heard), and also — as he points out just in case we were having trouble identifying the naked blond bodies piling up in various beds — Graham. But such doings are not on Graham’s mind. He is in a moral crisis: “I want someone to tell me what’s good. And I want someone to tell me what’s bad.” He goes on to ask what happens if there’s no one around to tell you what’s good and what’s bad.One thing that happens is a movie like “The Informers,” of which Graham and Martin are but two of a dozen or so principal inhabitants. They are neither the most messed up nor the least interesting characters to  surface in Gregor Jordan’s puzzling and tedious adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s book of short stories. But these two golden boys, like everyone else in this wasteland of privilege and hedonism —  “Los Angeles, 1983,” we’re told, in case we were having trouble placing the palm trees, the asymmetrical top-heavy haircuts and the post-punk soundtrack — are not so much characters as symbols of, well, of some pretty bad stuff.The corruption of innocence? The death of feeling? The bad vibes of a decade whose emblems (other than the haircuts and the music) are Ronald Reagan and AIDS? Yes, all of that. And some other stuff I probably forgot about. But so did they.The entitled young in this world favor cocaine, cigarettes and group sex. Their parents prefer alcohol, prescription medicines and adultery. The children regard the parents with icy contempt. Occasionally a flicker of guilt passes over a parental face, but it just may be that the parents are being played by seasoned actors, many with careers going back to the ’80s, and so can sometimes inject a grain or two of nuance into the glazed, dazed, dull surface of the film.Kim Basinger is in it, playing Graham’s mom. Also Billy Bob Thornton (as her husband, a movie-studio bigwig), Winona Ryder (as his mistress, a television newscaster), Chris Isaak and, alarmingly if also amusingly, Mickey Rourke. Mr. Rourke plays one of the few nonwealthy people in “The Informers.” He drives a van, sports some strange facial hair and kidnaps a child.Why? For the same reason that a hyperbolically drugged-out rock star (Mel Raido) punches a sweet-faced groupie from Nebraska. To shock us with our inability to feel especially shocked by anything. In Mr. Ellis’s book — not one of his best, but not without interest — the numb plainness of the prose at times achieves a morose clarity, and the deadpan, brain-dead dialogue is tweaked with satire. Nearly every time Mr. Jordan, working from a script by Mr. Ellis and Nicholas Jarecki, tries for similar effects, he goes badly awry, so that you snicker when the movie is trying to be poignant and groan when it aims to make a joke.From an opening scene that looks, intriguingly enough, like a Billy Idol video shot by  Antonioni, “The  Informers” moves through a few rounds of passionless coupling and passive-aggressive conversation, never provoking a reaction more intense than mild irritation or moderate boredom. The performances run the gamut from twitchy to catatonic, and the stoned stiffness of the actors seems to have less to do with the affectlessness of the characters than with their own confusion.“The Informers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sex, drug use and violence. And it’s still boring.THE INFORMERSOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Gregor Jordan; written by Bret Easton Ellis and Nicholas Jarecki, based on the novel by Mr. Ellis; director of photography, Petra Korner; edited by Robert Brakey; music by Christopher Young; production designer, Cecilia Montiel; produced by Marco Weber; released by Senator Distribution.

O. SCOTT,Sidekick Tries to Tow a Sequel,"What sidekick has not dreamed of stepping into the limelight? After dinner in their split-level cave, Betty and Barney, convinced that they were the modern stone-age family, must have fantasized about pitching “The Rubbles” to the suits at Hanna-Barbera. And surely poor, neglected Robin is at this moment lolling around somewhere in the Bat Cave sketching lobby posters for “The Boy Wonder,” which will never make it to a theater near you. And while we’re at it, how come students of literature are never forced to read a book called “Sancho Panza”?An implicit answer might be found in “Cars 2,” which takes the bold, arguably generous and ultimately calamitous step of pushing its lovable, goofy second banana to the center of the action. That would be Mater, the garrulous, snaggle-toothed, dimwitted tow truck voiced by Daniel Whitney, better known as Larry the Cable Guy. This may be Mater’s finest hour. It is certainly his longest.Lightning McQueen, the red racecar who speaks in the gee-whiz cadences of Owen Wilson, is still around, of course, as are some other residents of Radiator Springs, the Southwestern desert town surrounded by tail-fin rock formations where the first “Cars” took place. But they (Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin and the Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger, among others) are very much in the background. Most of “Cars 2” takes place far from Radiator Springs — in Tokyo, Paris and London — and Lightning’s racing exploits are secondary to the improbable adventures of Mater.These include a falling out with Lightning, an identity crisis (every animated character needs one) and an action-packed espionage caper with a couple of suave Britons. One is a retro-cool, Bond-style sports car named Finn McMissile (Michael Caine), and the other is a sexy, Emma Peel-like coupe called Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).There is a lot of zooming around, some stabs at gearhead humor, and a soupçon of environmental concern, thanks to a subplot involving a petroleum magnate (Eddie Izzard) who is using car races to promote his new alternative fuel. The villains are a pack of thuggish lemons led by a diabolical scientist (Thomas Kretschmann).Mostly, though, there is Mater, who tags along with Lightning on the grand prix circuit before falling in with the secret agents. Through it all, he talks and talks and talks, mangling idioms and missing the point in an exaggerated drawl that would make even the cast of “Hee-Haw” wince. As if to prove that certain groups have escaped the protection of political correctness, the Southern-fried Mater is dumb, excitable and puppy-dog loyal, his idiot-savant automotive expertise grounded in humble, blue-collar simplicity. I doubt anyone will protest much, but Pixar has now found its redneck Jar-Jar Binks. Such a proud moment.Even without Mater’s nattering — or the florid Italian sing-song of John Turturro as Lightning’s European rival (compare Sacha Baron Cohen in “Talladega Nights”) — “Cars 2” would be, by far, the loudest Pixar feature yet. The whine of engines and the rattle of gunfire (surprisingly frequent in a G-rated film) compete with the nonstop yakking to such an extent that Michael Giacchino’s score has to strain and blare to be heard. Perhaps after the exquisite silences in “Wall-E” and “Up,” the Pixar team wanted to open up the valves, kick up some dust and make some pop culture noise, leaving the poetry to someone else. Or maybe the company was tired of turning out one masterpiece after another and decided to coast for a while.“Cars 2” is certainly built to move merchandise — this series may surpass even the “Toy Story” films as an effective advertisement for licensed playthings — but it is notably lacking in soul or sublimity. Nearly every other Pixar fantasy, however extravagant, has been tethered to a recognizable human reality. But unlike “Toy Story” or “Ratatouille” or “Wall-E” or “Monsters Inc.,” the “Cars” movies have no human characters, and somehow this robs them of a crucial dimension of magic. It may be intriguing to imagine what our toys do when we leave them behind, but there is something irreducibly grim about an entire planet ruled by mass-produced consumer goods whose producers and consumers are nowhere around.But maybe I’m misinterpreting the movie and underestimating Pixar’s capacity for subversiveness. Maybe “Cars 2” is a dystopian allegory for an era of ecological anxiety.Or maybe not. I should add that it is not entirely without charm or wit. Directed by John Lasseter (with Brad Lewis credited as co-director) from a script by Ben Queen, “Cars 2” lavishes scrupulous imaginative attention on its cosmopolitan settings. The Tokyo sequences are especially gorgeous, a vibrant tribute to the anime aesthetic, streaked with neon and teeming with inventive pop cuteness.That city, and everywhere else on the globe where this busy, swift-moving picture touches down, turns into a video-game backdrop once the wheels start spinning. There is some ingenuity in this, but the visceral immediacy of arcade-style racing games does not come through, in spite of the skillful application of 3-D.And “Cars 2” illustrates one of the pitfalls of that format, which is that if the 3-D is unobtrusive enough that you don’t really notice it, you may as well forego the disposable glasses and the surcharge that comes with them.CARS 2Opens on Friday nationwide.Directed by John Lasseter; Brad Lewis, co-director; written by Ben Queen, based on a story by Mr. Lasseter and Brad Lewis; directors of photography, Sharon Calahan (lighting) and Jeremy Lasky (camera); music by Michael Giacchino; production design by Harley Jessup; produced by Denise Ream; released by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Studios.

And not because of the lip-smacking speculations surrounding Ms. Knox’s eight-year battle with the Italian legal system after being charged with the 2007 murder of a housemate and fellow exchange student, Meredith Kercher. Rather, the directors, Brian McGinn and Rod Blackhurst, have produced a tightly edited, coherently structured and ultimately moving reassessment that burrows beneath the lurid in search of the illuminating.Their tactic is simple: Deep-dive into the crime’s physical evidence (including previously unreleased police and television footage) and give the key players sufficient time to explain, redeem or indict themselves. What emerges is less a portrait of an accused killer than a glaring revelation of unprincipled journalism and unapologetic sexism. Inflamed by the smug moral certitude of the chief prosecutor, Giuliano Mignini, and by the smutty insinuations of reporters like Nick Pisa — a former contributor to The Daily Mail of London who marvels that anyone would expect fact-checking in the race to the front page — the public was all too eager to embrace rumor over reason.Not the directors, who spotlight a possibly contaminated crime scene, shaky forensic evidence and abusive police interrogations. They also show how we judge attractive young women who dare to stray from what we consider appropriate social behavior. And Ms. Knox, now a self-possessed advocate for the wrongly convicted (after being exonerated in 2015 by Italy’s highest court), fully understands how her quirky personality abetted the tabloid narrative.That narrative, though, makes “Amanda Knox” a savage denunciation of the way entertainment imperatives have corrupted the news media. At this singular moment in our political history, the resonance is deafening.",1,,,0

O. SCOTT,The Unsentimental Education That Preceded a Life of Fashion,"True to its title, “Coco Before Chanel” chronicles the early life of the woman who would become perhaps the single most influential figure in 20th-century fashion. But the film, directed and co-written by Anne Fontaine, bears less resemblance to a standard-issue biopic (like, say, “La Vie en Rose,” to take a recent French example) than to a novel by Émile Zola or Theodore Dreiser. With a mixture of brutal candor and tender sympathy, it charts the rise of an ambitious, difficult woman, taking note of the obstacles and opportunities offered by her time, place and circumstances.The tale begins in an orphanage, where the Chanel sisters, Gabrielle and Adrienne, have been deposited by their father. An inkling of Gabrielle’s eventual vocation is provided when the audience is directed to notice her noticing the stitching on the nuns’ wimples, but for the most part Ms. Fontaine avoids the easy prefiguring that deadens so many film biographies.She also steers clear of the kind of literal-minded psychologizing that finds the germ of future greatness in childhood trauma. Gabrielle and Adrienne, grown into Audrey Tautou and Marie Gillain, wind up in a provincial music hall, singing mildly naughty songs — one, about a lost dog named Coco, provides the nickname with which Gabrielle becomes famous — and trying not to be mistaken for the prostitutes who also frequent the place. Gabrielle, chain-smoking and sarcastic, confronts the world, and the men in it, with a wariness that borders on hostility.She is, from the start, a complicated, frequently uncharming character, and Ms. Tautou’s fierce and sinewy performance represents a decisive break with the dimpled-pixie typecasting she has been struggling against since “Amélie.” One fact of Gabrielle’s life is that a woman without money or status  can only acquire them by attaching herself to a man, ideally as a wife but more plausibly as a mistress. And so Adrienne finds a baron to keep her, while Gabrielle, after some combative flirting, hooks up with a playboy in uniform, a worldly and cynical fellow named Étienne Balsan (Benoît Poelvoorde).The relationship between them is affectionate, exploitive, transactional and unpredictable, and it is the most interesting aspect of “Coco Before Chanel.” With a mixture of impulsiveness and blunt premeditation Coco shows up at Étienne’s country mansion, where she installs herself as his mistress. His treatment of her is alternately gallant and appalling. For a long time he sequesters her in a back room and instructs her to eat in the kitchen, where she won’t be seen by his high society friends.But Coco crashes their parties, befriending a flamboyant actress named Emilienne (Emmanuelle Devos) and catching the eye of an English businessman known as Boy Capel (Alessandro Nivola). His soulful sensitivity makes him appear to be everything Étienne is not, and he offers Coco and the film a vision of true love.Ms. Fontaine indulges this romanticism but also points out the loose strings and sticking points. Boy, Coco’s ideal lover, is also something of an adventurer, a serial seducer whose only advantage over Étienne may be that he has better looks and better game. As far as acting is concerned, Mr. Poelvoorde wins. He plays each facet of Étienne’s repellent, gracious, selfish and sad personality with dazzling relish.In any case, such judgments are not really on the movie’s agenda. Rather than take a moralizing or pitying view of its characters, who live according to the social mores of their era and the logic of their desires, Ms. Fontaine examines them with curiosity and compassion.The result is an unusually vivid and convincing account of the historical past, composed in the present tense. Though its mood and methods are different, “Coco Before Chanel” shares with Jane Campion’s “Bright Star” — another new anti-biopic — a fascination, at once intense and dispassionate, with the lives of women in earlier centuries. Coco and Fanny Brawne, the heroine of Ms. Campion’s film, are not victims of oppression or paragons of resistance but rather individuals, made not of ideology or wishful thinking but of flesh and blood.And clothes of course. Both Fanny and Coco start out as seamstresses with an eye for novelty and a keen aesthetic sense. Coco disdains corsets, sometimes dresses in men’s garments, and adapts simple hats and fisherman’s shirts to marvelously chic effect. The blossoming of her ambition, as much as her love life, drives the story forward, and turns “Coco Before Chanel” into a costume drama worthy of the name.“Coco Before Chanel” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and a lot of cigarettes. No nudity, though, which would be a distraction from all those lovely clothes.COCO BEFORE CHANELOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Anne Fontaine; written by Ms. Fontaine and Camille Fontaine, with Christopher Hampton and Jacques Fieschi, adapted from the book “L’Irrégulière ou Mon Itinéraire Chanel” by Edmonde Charles-Roux; director of photography, Christophe Beaucarne; edited by Luc Barnier; music by Alexandre Desplat; production designer, Olivier Radot; produced by Carole Scotta, Caroline Benjo, Philippe Carcassonne and Simon Arnal; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

That muddy moment tells you exactly where you’ll be during the movie’s next hundred-plus minutes: toddling back and forth between the toilet and a sandbox stocked with inflatable sex dolls.The bodies swapped belong to the daddy, Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman), and his bachelor buddy, Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds). They have been best friends since third grade, though the movie offers no indication of any underlying kinship. A successful corporate lawyer in Atlanta, gunning for a partnership, Dave is a dour workaholic with an attractive, high-strung wife, Jamie (Leslie Mann), and three young children. He is so uptight that he blanches when a colleague raises an eyebrow over his necktie’s double Windsor knot.Mitch, an unemployed actor whose major credit is a role in a bologna commercial, is an extreme caricature of what used to be called a “toxic bachelor.” Still, he has no dearth of ravenous partners. It is a perfect role for Mr. Reynolds, Hollywood’s ranking male bimbo, whose infantile Mitch is so vacantly chirpy that he remains blissfully unaware that his lustful, foul-mouthed remarks to women might be the tiniest bit offensive.Kvetching about their petty discontents one drunken evening while urinating side by side into a public fountain, Dave and Mitch declare that they would like to live each other’s lives. With a lightning flash, Atlanta momentarily blacks out. When the lights return, the brooding expression on the face of the fountain’s statue has become a smirk.The next morning they discover that their idle wish has come true. When Dave turns to the mirror, he sees Mitch, and vice versa. Discovering that the magic fountain has been removed, they panic. Until it is restored in a new location, they’re stuck.The body-swapping premise, which is stale to begin with, isn’t explored with any depth, unless you find meaningful Freudian subtext in the movie’s relentless anal fixation. But the premise at least sets up a farce that surpasses “The Hangover” in gleeful crudeness and profanity. The similarities between the two movies aren’t coincidental: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore have written both. David Dobkin, the director of “The Change-Up,” is best known for “Wedding Crashers.”Once inside Dave’s body, Mitch is a criminally careless surrogate father who plunks his twin babies on a kitchen counter, where they clutch at knives and meat cleavers, reach into food processors, and explore electrical outlets. To Jamie’s chagrin, her husband advises their oldest daughter to lash back at a bullying fellow ballet student. “Violence is good,” he declares. Jamie has no idea what has happened to him. She knows only that something is terribly wrong.Mitch, in inappropriate golf clothes, swaggers into Dave’s law firm, where he derails a deal with a high-powered Japanese company with his frat-boy language and joshing racism. But he does manage to make a promising connection with Sabrina (Olivia Wilde), a luscious legal associate.Dave, cowering inside Mitch’s body, auditions for a “lorn” (light pornography) movie and is instructed to do nasty things to its grotesque, surgically altered female star.The big questions: Will Mitch, who has always secretly coveted Jamie, have his way with her? And in the end, whose penis belongs to whom?Mr. Bateman and Mr. Reynolds play together reasonably well, although their age difference (Mr. Reynolds is several years younger) is glaring. If both are adept comedians, neither has the wherewithal to begin to impersonate the other’s body language and thereby raise the farce to a higher comic level.Inevitably succumbing to schmaltz, “The Change-Up” turns cloying in its perfunctory later scenes, in which each friend comes away from the ordeal having absorbed useful life lessons while in the body of his polar opposite. No matter how diligently “The Change-Up” scrubs itself, it leaves behind a faint if unmistakable scent from its initial eruption.“The Change-Up,” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, relentless profanity and scatological humor.THE CHANGE-UPOpens on Friday nationwide.Directed by David Dobkin; written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; director of photography, Eric Edwards; edited by Lee Haxall and Greg Hayden; music by John Debney; production design by Barry Robison; costumes by Betsy Heimann; produced by Mr. Dobkin and Neal H.

O. SCOTT,Joke Is on the Siblings of a Modern Holy Fool,"“Our Idiot Brother” blends two of the staples of modern screen comedy: it’s a bittersweet, indie-ish study of grown-up sibling relations, and also a raucous celebration of male immaturity. At its center are three sisters — variously wanton, manipulative and unfulfilled — and their sweet, goofy man-child of a brother. At first it is the brother’s inability or refusal to behave like a grown-up that seems to be the big problem, but by the end he functions as a kind of holy fool, exposing the hypocrisy and unhappiness of everyone around him.This shaggy innocent is named Ned, and if he were played by anyone other than Paul Rudd, he would be utterly unbearable. A cheerful hippie living in a bohemian-rural stretch of upstate New York, Ned is so dim and trusting that he sells a bag of weed to a friendly-seeming police officer in uniform. Released on parole, Ned goes home to find that his erstwhile lady friend, Janet (Kathryn Hahn), has taken up with Billy (a taller, dimmer, red-headed version of Ned, played by T. J. Miller). She also refuses to give up custody of Willie Nelson, a sandy-haired canine version of Ned, who turns out to be a handy plot device at several crucial points.So Ned, homeless and dogless, journeys to Brooklyn, crashing with each of his sisters and upending their metropolitan routines with his cheerful, guileless, earthy spirit. The first stop is Park Slope, fertile ground for sociological clichémongers, where Liz (Emily Mortimer) lives with her husband, Dylan (Steve Coogan), and their two small children in a grotto of brownstone self-righteousness. Their marriage is as hollow as their ostentatiously paraded “values,” and Ned promptly subverts their household order by turning their 7-year-old son, River (Matthew Mindler), onto the joys of YouTube, play-fighting and Inspector Clouseau.If Liz is the stereotypical anxious mom, Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) are no less familiar types, from other movies if not precisely from real urban life. Miranda is an ambitious, insecure careerist, angling for a big break at Vanity Fair (where Evgenia Peretz, one of the screenwriters, is a contributing editor).Natalie, living in a communal crash pad and tiptoeing toward commitment with her serious-minded lover, Cindy (Rashida Jones), is an artist’s model aspiring to be a stand-up comedian, or a performance artist, or something that involves standing up and talking about herself in a dimly lighted, sparsely peopled room.Efficiently directed by Jesse Peretz (Ms. Peretz’s brother, evidently quite capable), “Our Idiot Brother” is a thin, unconvincing movie made likable by the charm and skill of its cast and by a script (by Ms. Peretz and her husband, David Schisgall) peppered with wit and insight.Mr. Coogan is as much a master of genial hostility as Ms. Mortimer is of emotional vulnerability, and the two of them add credibility to their warmed-over characters. It is always nice to see Ms. Banks and Ms. Deschanel, but Miranda and Natalie are more ideas than people, and the performers are stuck being gratingly energetic (Ms. Banks) and exasperatingly slack (Ms. Deschanel).Ms. Jones, given less to work with, does more than most of her counterparts, and when Cindy is around, you might wish that the projectionist would change the reels and show a movie about her instead of all these other tiresome folks.A handful of scenes — a visit to a cultish self-help seminar, a family game of charades with Mom (Shirley Knight), a profile interview gone off the rails — are sharp, funny and surprising. But the filmmakers mostly look for humor in obvious, picked-over places. Can we please have a moratorium on private-school interviews? Like yoga classes (which this movie blessedly leaves alone), they are hard in real life and suspiciously easy in movies.And far too much in “Our Idiot Brother” is much too easy, including the soft, sentimental indulgence it lavishes on Ned and the satirical barbs it flings at his sisters. “You’ve ruined our lives,” they complain, almost in chorus.But, in fact, Ned’s mellow, agrarian authenticity has only revealed the bad faith on which those lives are based. Against all the posturing, duplicity and empty ambition, he upholds simple virtues of fidelity, professional ethics and common-sense parenting. This dude, who had seemed at first glance to be a lesser Lebowski, content to tend his garden and smoke a few nice buds, turns out to be a curiously retrograde paladin: the reluctant scourge and benevolent protector of bossy, wayward and otherwise messed-up women.And for all its sweetness, this movie leaves behind the sour taste of unexamined male entitlement. However clever those sisters may be, they cannot do it for themselves. Even if he’s an idiot, brother knows best.“Our Idiot Brother” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

O. SCOTT,A Ballad for Those Lost in Love and in Pride,"“This was in Texas,” a title at the beginning of “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” tells us, but we would most likely have figured that out before too long. We are in a land of courteous lawmen and soulful outlaws, skinny women in plain dresses and squinty-eyed killers in black hats. These folks ride around in battered pickup trucks and peek out through the screen doors of peeling clapboard farmhouses. Occasionally one of them will aim a rifle or a pistol in another’s direction. An older fellow says “howdy.” What other state could it be?The period setting of this moody, western-ish crime drama, written and directed by David Lowery, is a bit harder to place, though the shape of the cars and a briefly glimpsed television set suggest the late 1960s or early 1970s. Not that it matters much. We could just as easily be in the 1870s or the 1930s, since the themes of violence, honor and sacrifice are as unchanging as the big, cloud-swept sky. This is a landscape of archetypes, where individual stories take on a mythic, even metaphysical resonance.The story here begins with two young lovers, Bob (Casey Affleck) and Ruth (Rooney Mara), quarreling and then making up in a meadow flooded with amber late-day sunlight. Ruth tells Bob that she’s pregnant, and then he goes off to commit a robbery. A shootout at a remote farmhouse leaves Bob’s partner dead and a deputy wounded by a bullet from Ruth’s gun. Bob takes the rap and goes to prison, leaving Ruth to raise their daughter, Sylvie, and wait for his return. The deputy, Patrick (Ben Foster), looks in on Ruth and Sylvie from time to time, and seems, in his polite way, to be interested in taking Bob’s place. Mr. Lowery strums the chords of this ballad with skill and sincerity. (The musical score, by Daniel Hart, is too often busy and insistent when the film needs it to be plaintive and spare.) “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” moves fluidly and gracefully through situations that are hauntingly understated, as well as some that test the limits of credibility.But the film’s problems have less to do with the plausibility of its narrative than with the studiousness and solemnity of its mood. Strong emotions — desperation, dread, desire — are indicated but not really communicated, and everything happens in a hazy atmosphere of humorless homage and exquisite good taste.The tale of Bob, Ruth and Patrick — and secondary characters like Skerritt (Keith Carradine), Bob’s reluctant surrogate father, and Sweetie (Nate Parker), a saloonkeeper who gives Bob some aid and comfort — could have been a pulpy chronicle of lust and greed, or a Cormac McCarthy-esque exercise in backwoods humor and existential mischief. These are decidedly not the angles Mr. Lowery chooses. Instead, the wonder-of-nature cinematography (by Bradford Young) and the fluid editing betray a heavy debt to the work of Terrence Malick, though with little of Mr. Malick’s intellectual gravity or visionary ambition.Authenticity is rarely a fair standard for judging movies, which always depend on overt and invisible artifice. But this film’s longing for just that quality — for a simple, elemental truth that will be both specific to its time and place and ripe with deeper meanings — is precisely what makes it unconvincing.",0,200000.0,,1

There’s even an auto teetering on a cliff as the driver tries to yank the passengers out just in time.Fortunately, there are seasoned actors in villainous roles, in this case a persuasively sleazy John Cusack and the formidable Australian Jacki Weaver (who received Oscar nominations for “Animal Kingdom” and “Silver Linings Playbook”). They play a pair of child traffickers assisted by an underdrawn moll (Veronica Faye Foo) and henchman (Jandres Burgos). And there’s the appealing Rachelle Lefevre (from “Under the Dome”) as the wife of a Chicago toy designer (a bland Ryan Phillippe) to bring a spry, coltish energy to the efficient, if routine, goings-on.The plot? Mr. Phillippe and Ms. Lefevre’s characters seek to adopt a 7-year-old Haitian earthquake survivor (an adorable Briana Roy), only to find themselves ensnared by a shady operation that brokers an “adoption” for hefty fees and then “reclaims” — essentially, kidnaps — the youngster and leaves town with the money.A message before the closing credits cites the widespread incidence of child trafficking, but any social import is lost.

Takua Pa, the place is called, and a woman named Na (Anchalee Saisoontorn) calls it home.Na works at a rundown but well-scrubbed hotel that doesn’t see many guests these days until the arrival of Ton (Supphasit Kansen), a handsome young architect overseeing a beachfront development. Na and Ton play their parts — she, the curious, reticent housekeeper; he, the shy, grateful guest — but another game is afoot, slipping around the edges of their customary roles. The faintest blush, a lingering look, a gift of oranges from the market, a conversation that goes on a little longer than normal. They’re falling, ever so softly, in love.Mr. Assarat shelters this budding romance with surpassingly lovely filmmaking, easing into and out of scenes with an unrushed tempo that lets each emotion, thought and subtle effect flower, then fade away. His frames are meticulous without being fussy and his camera movements suave and suggestive, delineating the sentiment of the moment with precision and grace.You could call such camerawork Jamesian, for the elegance with which it traces the contours of experience — or perhaps, given the context, Apichatpongian is the better term. The mellow bliss and aesthetic delicacy of “Wonderful Town” recall the work of the ingenious Thai cinéaste Apichatpong Weerasethakul, creator of idiosyncratic romances like  “Tropical Malady” and “Syndromes and a Century.” Mr. Assarat shares with his compatriot an elegant, intuitive ease coupled with prodigious formal control, though  of a less experimental bent than his better-known colleague.As in one of Mr. Weerasethakul’s beguiling narratives, where time and space are mercurial creatures and mythical beasts pad through the forest, the air in “Wonderful Town” feels charged with weird energies, as if something strange and possibly menacing is about to erupt. And so it does, in a single word, uttered by Ton in pillow talk with Na: “Tsunami.”That beachfront property, adjacent to a ruined building rumored to be haunted; that lonely hotel that used to bustle with tourists; that aspect of something submerged in Ton’s physical carriage and expression — these are remnants of the cataclysmic storm from 2004 that claimed thousands of lives in Takua Pa.Another remnant cruises the streets, psychic ruin on wheels: a crew of disaffected teenagers prowling about on motorcycles, displaced, trouble-seeking, adrift, fated to break forth the tensions beneath the film’s placid surface.“Wonderful Town,” by its third act, is a title drowning in irony. Wondrous, nevertheless, is Mr. Assarat’s sustained command as he guides his material into darker waters. It’s no small feat to pull off as sweet and sensitive a romance as that between Na and Ton, and something rarer yet to suffuse such affections into a poem of wounded landscape.WONDERFUL TOWNOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Written (in Thai, with English subtitles) and directed by Aditya Assarat; director of photography, Umpornpol Yugala; edited by Lee Chatametikool; music by Koichi Shimizu and Zai Kuning; production designer, Karanyapas Khamsin; produced by Soros Sukhum and Jetnipith Teerakulchanyut; released by Kino International.

It’s not, yet despite a lackluster start, this documentary redeems itself by the finale.Set initially in Lahore, Pakistan, the film follows the Sachal Jazz Ensemble, a scrappy group of musicians working in a place where a love of the arts can cost you your life. Though the city was once bustling with performers, a strict Islamic government took control decades ago and stifled artists.Restrictions have eased recently, but there is still a real threat of violence. Such oppression has also reduced the numbers of players and audiences, further disheartening musicians there.Early scenes in “Lahore” outline the history and introduce the Sachal players. That can be interesting though uninvolving, and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Andy Schocken, the directors, provide too few details on the Pakistani instruments and musical forms we hear.As the ensemble’s fame grows through Internet videos, it is invited to the United States to perform with Wynton Marsalis and his band. Almost immediately, what had been a flat story turns energetic and captivating; the Pakistani musicians’ worries over their skills are palpable, and their doubts visible on their faces. Once they arrive in New York, the stresses that arise during rehearsals with their American counterparts can bring to mind the tension in another jazz film, “Whiplash.”It gives away nothing to say that the trip is (mostly) a triumph for the Sachal players. The scenes shown from their Jazz at Lincoln Center concert are delightful enough to have you wish for three or four more songs. It’s a far cry from that slow-going beginning, and well worth the wait.

She runs a sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo for orphaned and otherwise rescued bonobos, and the film portrays her first efforts to release some of them back into the wild.But the film is not a documentary; instead it is, the screen credits say, “freely adapted from an original idea by Claudine André and the true story of Beni,” whatever that means. Beni, a particularly inquisitive bonobo, comes to the sanctuary as a very young orphan. As he grows, we hear his thoughts via a cloying voice-over, and they’re very human.The practice of attributing the emotions and aspirations of people to wild animals is questionable, but it’s not uncommon in nature films and TV shows, especially those trying to appeal to children. For grown-ups, at least, it’s distracting here, and you’re never quite sure how much of what you’re seeing actually occurred. But none of that diminishes your admiration for Ms. André and the staff members at the sanctuary as they labor to preserve bonobos, one animal at a time.",0,,,1
996,2016-09-09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:25,A. O. SCOTT,Review: ‘Author: The JT Leroy Story’ Renders a Literary Charlatan,"It’s sometimes said that forgers of old-master paintings are accomplished artists in their own right. A successful fraud — even if it’s ultimately uncovered — requires discipline, hard work and talent, and it’s hard not to feel at least a grudging respect for charlatans who fool the public and especially the experts. We don’t call them con artists for nothing.In the literary world, things are a little different. The peddlers of false memoirs and fishy identities are rarely celebrated for their ingenuity. “Author: The JT Leroy Story,” a new documentary by Jeff Feuerzeig (“The Devil and Daniel Johnston”), is a curious attempt to redeem, at least partly, the reputation of a notorious hoax. JT Leroy, whose fame flickered for about a decade starting in the mid-1990s, was both a writer of overtly autobiographical fiction and an entirely fictional character. “He” was a complex and compelling creation: an H.I.V.-positive underage gay hustler with a history of drug addiction and sexual abuse who infused grim tales of degradation with lyricism and a kind of holy innocence.Ostensibly still a teenager when he started publishing his stories, JT Leroy appeared in public as a soft-spoken waif in a blond wig, dark glasses and baggy, androgynous clothes. Earlier he had struck up intense friendships, conducted entirely over the telephone, with well-known writers and other celebrities. JT Leroy’s face belonged to a young woman named Savannah Knoop. His voice — both on the page and on the phone — was the creation of Laura Albert, who is the main subject and primary source in Mr. Feuerzeig’s film. She tells the story of her creation with a touch of humor, a measure of candor and very little regret. Ms. Albert doesn’t like to think of JT Leroy as a hoax, preferring the loftier word “myth.”To some extent she has a point. But rather than investigate the meaning of the Leroy myth, “Author” allows Ms. Albert to revise and perpetuate it. She describes JT — the initials stand for Jeremiah Terminator — as a persona that grew out of her own history of pain and marginality. As a survivor of abuse, bullying and mental illness, she says, she found in the frail and dreamy JT a viable alter ego, the first-person narrator of fantasies that leaked into the real world.He was born in a series of phone calls to crisis hotlines and therapists, one of whom encouraged Terminator (as he identified himself then) to start writing. As JT’s career took off, Ms. Albert enlisted her boyfriend, Geoffrey Knoop, a musician, and his sister Savannah in the ruse. Ms. Albert herself played a few different characters in addition to the offstage JT, including Speedie, an Englishwoman who served as the writer’s confidante, big sister and informal manager.In retrospect — as you watch the archival footage Mr. Feuerzeig has collected and the home-movie snippets and recorded phone conversations Ms. Albert has saved — it’s hard to believe that so many people could have been fooled for so long. Speedie’s British accent was laughable, JT’s biography was so lurid as to verge on the preposterous, and his writing combined pornographic content with greeting-card sentimentality. Its appeal was based largely on the “facts” of his miserable, magical life.But of course a lot of people, including a lot of famous and creative people, were eager to buy into the myth. “Author” is most interesting — and least self-aware — as a study in the gullibility and narcissism of the celebrity class. JT Leroy’s prominent friends (including the singers Bono, Courtney Love and Billy Corgan; the writers Dennis Cooper and Mary Karr; and the filmmakers Gus Van Sant and Asia Argento) may have found in him a mirror of their own wishful thinking about art and authenticity.He was, in their minds, a wondrous wildflower blooming in the dirt, an immaculate, unschooled talent they were pleased to nurture and protect. He (that is, Ms. Albert), flattered their vanity and allowed them to wrap their voyeurism in the cloak of empathy.Eventually the bluff was called, in part thanks to reporting done by Warren St. John for The New York Times in early 2006. The tale of JT Leroy’s unmasking still has a tawdry tabloid fascination, and Ms. Albert’s account of her frantic attempts at spinning and wagon-circling are in some ways the most forthright part of her narrative, even if she still seems a bit wounded that anyone could have doubted her or JT.Ten years later, Ms. Albert is too ambitious and too intoxicated with her own grift to venture a frank assessment of its causes and consequences. And in spite of her well-established history of dishonesty, Mr. Feuerzeig makes no great effort to challenge — or even to verify — her claims about herself or anyone else. A few other people are interviewed, but the ethical, psychological and cultural meanings of the story remain mostly unexamined.“Author” is thus less a documentary than an infomercial, a prelude to an attempted second act. Ms. Albert, having attracted attention while in disguise, now wants more. And her testimony is interesting, even if it — and this movie — cannot be trusted.“Author: The JT Leroy Story” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

SCOTT,"The Design of Cities, Intelligent or Otherwise","Those of us who live in cities — more than half the world’s population, according to many recent estimates — experience them mainly at eye and street level. Each urban environment has its own character and can therefore seem more like the result of natural processes than of complex human intentions. A city develops organically, through the complex interplay of economics, biology and countless local, individual decisions, but also by means of planning on the part of architects, engineers and politicians.The mingling of design and happenstance is, to some extent, the deep subject of “Urbanized,” Gary Hustwit’s fascinating, idea-packed new documentary. In this remarkably concise film — which could easily have sprawled to 15 hours on public television — Mr. Hustwit and his crew survey both the challenges and promises facing some of the world’s important cities. Their itinerary may not take them everywhere you want it to, but it also turns up some unexpected vistas along with familiar ones.Here is Paris, yes, and New York (looking especially gorgeous in the movie’s final shot), and here are the slums of Mumbai and the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. But have you heard about the bike lanes of Bogotá, Colombia? About the walkways threaded through the townships on the outskirts of Cape Town? About the new housing projects that are replacing the informal settlements in Santiago, Chile?All of that was news to me, but even viewers with deep knowledge of modern urban planning are likely to learn something from the carefully selected images and thoughtful interviews that make up most of “Urbanized.” This is the third film in Mr. Hustwit’s trilogy of documentaries on the role of design in the modern world, and it can be thought of as the conceptual shell that contains the other two. The first, “Helvetica,” is about the shape of the printed word, and in particular the font named in the title. “Objectified” concerns itself with the shape and packaging of the things we buy, sell and carry. In both cases a phenomenon likely to be taken for granted is shown to have a complex back story, a set of often unexamined reasons for being the way it is.“Urbanized” is less focused on the history of cities than on the way they are adapting to the challenges of the present and future, notably climate change and population growth. This slant leaves some inevitable gaps — the David-and-Goliath battle between Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs is mentioned, but important earlier figures like Daniel Burnham and Frederick Law Olmsted are not — and there is a distinct bias in favor of Jacobs-influenced new urbanism and against other approaches to city planning.Defenders of mid-20th-century Brasília and early-21st-century Phoenix are heard from, but the prevailing argument in “Urbanized” is that these cities are examples of how to do it wrong. The Brazilian capital is seen as a monument of modernist arrogance, while Phoenix represents soul-killing standardization and the reckless overconsumption of carbon-based fuel. Against these follies, the case is made for pedestrian-friendly metropolitan cores, bicycle lanes and an ethic that combines the knowledge of experts with the desires and innovations of local residents.Mr. Hustwit relies more on the testimony of professionals than on the wisdom of ordinary people, but that is in keeping with the overall mood of the film, which is lively, curious and pedagogical. Like a really good class taught by a team of enthusiastic professors, “Urbanized” supplies grist for many late-night arguments or solitary ruminations. It is worth venturing out of your room, climbing on your bike or boarding a low-emissions bus and fighting your way through a crowd to see.URBANIZEDOpens on Friday in Manhattan.Produced and directed by Gary Hustwit; director of photography, Luke Geissbühler; edited by Shelby Siegel and Michael Culyba; released by Swiss Dots.

998,2013-07-26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-02 04:18:17,A. O. SCOTT,Turning Up the Voices From the Background,"The song that plays over the opening titles of “20 Feet From Stardom,” Morgan Neville’s new documentary, is Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side,” a provocative choice and also an appropriate one. The notorious lyrics of the chorus — “and the colored girls sing/doo, da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo doo ... ” — establish the movie’s subject and also its reason for being. This generous, fascinating documentary about the careers of backup singers, most of them African-American women, seeks to rewrite the history of pop music by focusing attention on voices at once marginal and vital.With the splendid exception of Darlene Love, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011, most of the vocalists interviewed on screen are not well known, even though they can be heard on many of the most popular and durable recordings of the past half-century. Ms. Love, who did not receive proper credit for her singing on a number of Phil Spector-produced hits of the ’60s, worked as a house cleaner before claiming a rightful place in the spotlight in more recent decades.The film includes many other stories of solo careers that did not quite happen. One of its themes is the mysterious combination of luck, ambition and prejudice that keeps some hugely talented musicians in the shadows while others, perhaps less gifted, become big stars.Some of the people who reflect on this situation are very big stars themselves, like Sting, Bruce Springsteen and Mick Jagger. Their praise of the backup singers they’ve worked with is sincere and insightful, but their presence also emphasizes the gender and racial imbalances that are as deeply ingrained in popular music as bass, guitar and drums.As Mr. Springsteen notes, the give-and-take between the lead vocalist and the supporting chorus has its roots in the call-and-response of the black church, where most of the singers in the movie started out. Many of them are the daughters of preachers, and one, Dr. Mable John, has come full circle. A former Raelette, who oohed and aahed alongside Ray Charles, she is now a pastor and the founder of the Joy in Jesus Ministries in Los Angeles.“20 Feet From Stardom” is a chronicle of exploitation and appropriation — in other words, the music business — and also a series of tales of professional commitment and artistic triumph. The picture it paints is gratifyingly complicated. Some singers who came up in the highly disciplined rhythm-and-blues milieu of the 1960s felt liberated when white rock acts like the Rolling Stones came along and encouraged them to be, as more than one pointedly puts it, “blacker.”Merry Clayton tells of being summoned to a recording studio in the middle of the night, pregnant and with her hair in curlers, to record an incendiary vocal track on “Gimme Shelter.” Claudia Lennear was an integral part of the Stones’ shows in the early ’70s, as Lisa Fischer, a singer of truly prodigious range and delicacy, has been since 1989.Ms. Clayton also sang on Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama,” a song whose Southern-pride message she found more than a little alienating. Her account of how the presence of her voice subverts some of the political intentions of the record is almost convincing. But her performance of Neil Young’s “Southern Man,” captured on a television broadcast sometime in the ’70s, is a revelation. Backed by a funk band and sporting a cloud of “natural” hair, she turns Mr. Young’s earnest, scolding indictment of Southern racism (which partly provoked Lynyrd Skynyrd’s defensive anthem) into a tour de force of rage, passion and defiant virtuosity. You see how a singer can transform a song.You see a lot of that in “20 Feet From Stardom,” which invites you to listen with new ears to songs you thought you knew, including David Bowie’s “Young Americans” and some of Sting’s recent work. The film is more about spirit than about technique, which is understandable but also perhaps a bit disappointing. The human voice is a mysterious, powerful instrument, and it would be good to learn more about its secrets from those who have mastered them. But in the end the demonstration of that mastery may be more satisfying than the analysis of it, and matching new faces to voices we already know is a gift for music fans.",0,,,1
999,2015-02-01,Field Niggas,,USA,Khalik Allah,Documentary,"Spanish, English",83.0,60.0,,2015,7.4,81.0,10.0,2017-11-02 04:18:20,GLENN KENNY,Review: ‘Field Niggas’ Is a Meditation on Life on the Streets of East Harlem,"From its nonchalantly blunt title forward, “Field Niggas,” a new film shot, edited and directed by Khalik Allah, aims to smack viewers in the back of the head and snap them to attention. This hourlong feature, the filmmaker’s debut, depicts dozens of faces and bodies, black, white and brown, most of them gathered at the intersection of 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in East Harlem, during the summer of 2014. None of these faces and bodies belong to actors, but it won’t do to call this powerful film a documentary.From the opening shots, there is an evident affinity with the Portuguese director Pedro Costa, who structured a trilogy of dramas around the lives of residents in Fontainhas, a poor section of Lisbon. In Mr. Allah’s film, one image of a young African-American woman, front-lit with what could be taken as an almost heavenly radiance, calls to mind Mr. Costa’s strategy of mining beauty from subjects and objects merely by depicting them with pinpoint clarity. Mr. Allah toys with focus quite a bit throughout his parade of close-ups, but when he comes in sharp, the details of skin textures, the whites and pupils of the eyes, and more, are always startling. But unlike Mr. Costa’s films, Mr. Allah’s cinema is on the fast side; this hourlong movie is a kind of montage, with some shots lasting only a second or two; the longest rarely go beyond 30 or 40.Accompanying his images is an asynchronous soundtrack, in which the voices of the subjects hold forth on various topics. “I been around a lot of real people,” one says early on. The emergent theme is that in Harlem, life on the street is a form of prison or slavery. (In some cases, that prison is created by drug addiction; many shots show smoke pouring slowly out of various mouths, and much of the talk in the film is about the street drug K2, a synthetic marijuana.)And while Mr. Allah mixes some field calls into the soundtrack to underscore this idea of bondage, his film is so beautifully constructed that nothing in it ever seems obvious. In his poetic way, and his eventual approach to the metaphysical, he makes his case. While the movie’s multiple images are never less than numinous, and its rhythms sometimes skirt the strangely seductive, this astonishing movie is the opposite of hypnotic.This film is not rated.",1,,,0
