0,A.O. SCOTT,0,2018-01-26 17:44:01,In the Fade,Review: ‘In the Fade’ Is a Tale of Grief and Violence in Modern Germany,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/movies/in-the-fade-review-diane-kruger.html,2017-12-27,2017-12-26,"In Fatih Akin’s new film, Diane Kruger plays a Hamburg woman who fights for justice and sanity after the murder of her husband and son.","“In the Fade,” the new film by Fatih Akin, is divided into three parts. The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to “Law & Order” fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.Mr. Akin, whose previous features include the explosive “Head-On” and the sprawling, wrenching political melodrama “The Edge of Heaven,” observes his characters and their social environment with a rigorously measured mix of intensity and detachment. Katja, in the days and weeks after the attack, spirals through stages of grief, shock and despair. Surrounded by relatives, friends and in-laws, and visited by pushy, polite detectives, she seems desperately, furiously alone. Because her husband, Nuri (Numan Akar), was a Turkish immigrant and a former drug dealer, the police raise the specters of Islamist terrorism and gang activity. Katja is adamant: “Nazis killed my husband.” She has the grim satisfaction of being right.If the first section of “In the Fade” provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life — the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism — the second part zeros in on the gears of the country’s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous.But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back?That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie’s final section, which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as “In the Fade” should be reaching its starkest, sharpest point, as Katja’s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis, Mr. Akin’s focus seems to waver, and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling, when it wants to be devastating, and the political and personal sides of the story, rather than illuminating each other, fight to a stalemate.Ms. Kruger, however, who won the best actress award at Cannes in May, leaves a vivid, haunting impression. Katja, who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability, struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone, the world is dislodged from its axis, and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again. Dwelling in her sorrow is agonizing, but moving on might be even worse.","Numan Acar, Adam Bousdoukos, Diane Kruger, Denis Moschitto",N/A,"Germany, France",Fatih Akin,"Crime, Drama, Thriller","German, Greek, English, Turkish",65,"Katja's life collapses after the death of her husband and son in a bomb attack.

Paul Getty, is magnetic in the film, which recounts the 1973 kidnapping of his grandson.","“The quality of mercy is not strained,” Portia tells Shylock in “The Merchant of Venice.” It is “twice blest; it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.” The billionaire J. Paul Getty would probably have disagreed with Shakespeare’s take. A hoarder of women, art, antiquities — and most of all, money — Getty also might have taken issue with Portia’s claim that mercy “becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.” Portia delivers her mercy speech as she tries to persuade Shylock not to take a pound of flesh. She would have had an even tougher time with Getty.“All the Money in the World” is a story of towering greed and the absence of mercy, and an ideal 21st century morality tale. It’s about money and families and the ties that bind and cut, although because it was directed by Ridley Scott there isn’t a jot of sentimentalism gumming the works. In July 1973, John Paul Getty III (known as Paul), the elder Getty’s 16-year-old grandson, was snatched off a street in Rome. His kidnappers demanded $17 million in ransom, telling Paul’s mother, “Get it from London.” It was a reference to Getty Sr., who in turn responded, “If I pay one penny now, I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren,” a kiss-off heard around the world.Mr. Scott sets the scene quickly with a somewhat phantasmagoric meander through Rome’s crowded streets. It’s night, and pretty, boyish Paul (Charlie Plummer) is savoring la dolce vita, floating past the city’s flesh and marble beauties and its swarms of catcalling, hustling paparazzi. There’s sensuousness to Paul’s drift, which, as the camera silkily slips alongside him, suggests a casual luxurious attitude toward life, of being free to do anything, go anywhere, say anything. He’s kissed by fortune but also by youth. And when a streetwalker calls him baby and he smiles, you see just how young. Within seconds he’s been kidnapped.“All the Money in the World” revs up beautifully, first as a thriller. But while the kidnapping is the movie’s main event, it is only part of a story that is, by turns, a sordid, desperate and anguished tragedy about money. When Paul is kidnapped, Getty Sr. (Christopher Plummer) has already amassed a fortune, one partly pumped out of oil fields both in the United States and in the Middle East. (The Plummers are not related.) He lives alone in crepuscular gloom in Sutton Place, a manor house built by a favorite courtier of Henry VIII. There, amid miles of rooms adorned with gilt-framed masterworks, Getty Sr. closely monitors the stock information on the disgorging ticker tape that’s both his leash and lifeline.Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn’t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn’t matter.Like many contemporary movies, this one kinks up its timeline. After Paul is kidnapped, the scene shifts to Saudi Arabia in 1948, where Getty Sr. is laying the foundation for an even greater fortune. Written by David Scarpa — working from John Pearson’s 1995 book “Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty” — the movie continues to jump around, filling in the back story while deepening the atmosphere and gathering the dramatis personae. One intimate scene takes place in the 1960s, where Paul’s mother, Gail (Michelle Williams, warmth incarnate), and father, Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), are going broke with four boisterous young children.By the time Paul is kidnapped, his nuclear family has imploded; Getty Jr. is lost in an opium cloud and Gail is living in Rome. Much of the movie involves the drama of the kidnapping, which unfolds in separate, increasingly tightly woven-together lines of action. Taken by a ragtag criminal gang, Paul is stashed in a desolate farmhouse, where his closest keeper becomes Cinquanta (Romain Duris, a charismatically feral presence). In Rome, Gail struggles with the kidnappers, police and paparazzi while trying to interest Getty Sr. in his grandson. Getty Sr. continues counting out his money, only reluctantly calling in the cavalry, a security specialist, Fletcher (a very fine Mark Wahlberg).Mr. Scott conjures up entire worlds and sensibilities with visual precision, adding detail even when going for sweep. Each new scene adds another layer of meaning, thickening the slow-building sense of dread: the men in billowing white robes on oil-rich land waiting for Getty Sr., a master of the universe who arrives in a demonically belching train. Gail and Getty Jr., anxiously presenting their young family to Getty Sr. like paupers bowing down before the lord of the realm. As the story shifts from farmhouse to manor, from the kidnappers to Getty Sr. (each side armed, impatient, brutal), a parallelism develops and it becomes clear that he took his family hostage long before the kidnapping.Mr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya’s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he’s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It’s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation.At one point in the movie, Getty Sr. does pull out his wallet, buying a masterpiece while Paul continues to languish with his kidnappers, an ordeal that grows more frightening and byzantine as the clock winds down. Gail and Fletcher are struggling to free Paul, an effort that finds them often grappling with Getty Sr. His interest in Paul rises and falls, much like the stock market does. He has become famous for his status as the wealthiest man in the world, prominence that he clings to, much like his money. He has filled his manor house with priceless objects, turning statues and paintings into fetishes. He has earned so much, spent so much and, in doing so, insured that he and everyone else have lost.","Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg, Romain Duris","&pound;20,153,135","USA, Italy, UK",Ridley Scott,"Biography, Crime, Drama","English, Italian, Arabic",72,The story of the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother to convince his billionaire grandfather Jean Paul Getty to pay the ransom.,R,TriStar Pictures,"[{'Value': '6.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",25 Dec 2017,132 min,All the Money in the World,"David Scarpa, John Pearson (based on the book 'Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J.

2,A.O. SCOTT,1,2018-01-24 17:44:02,Phantom Thread,Review: Daniel Day-Lewis Sews Up Another Great Performance in ‘Phantom Thread’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/movies/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis.html,2017-12-25,2017-12-24,Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film is a luxuriant love story set in 1950s London.,"Reynolds Woodcock, a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s, has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (“Never cursed” is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a princess.) These invisible traces of his hand — hidden meanings in the literal sense — signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art, obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator.It hardly seems an accident that Paul Thomas Anderson has inscribed his monogram in the title of his eighth feature, “Phantom Thread,” which chronicles a few chapters in Reynolds’s fictional life and career. This is a profoundly, intensely, extravagantly personal film. I don’t mean autobiographical. I know little and care less about the details of Mr. Anderson’s personal life. Whether or not his longtime partner, the actress and comedian Maya Rudolph, has ever cooked him a mushroom omelet is a matter of complete indifference to me.Not every movie about an artist is a self-portrait of its director, but “Phantom Thread” almost offhandedly lays out intriguing analogies between Reynolds’s métier and Mr. Anderson’s. The fashion designer, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, turns drawings into drama, manipulating color and movement and the human form to construct a material object that is also artificial, idealized and fantastical — a commodity that impersonates a dream. He is assisted in his labor by a crew of disciplined artisans who cut and stitch his ideas into usable form. (This may be the place to note that the editor of “Phantom Thread” is Dylan Tichenor. Mark Bridges designed the costumes. Mr. Anderson served as his own director of photography.)The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It’s just a movie. It’s just a dress. When Reynolds’s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more “chic,” the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions.That discrepancy — between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism — may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since “There Will Be Blood,” Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they’re about or who they might be for.“Phantom Thread” is not as hermetic as “The Master” or as loosey-goosey as “Inherent Vice.” It’s a chamber piece, romantic and baroque in equal measure, with arresting harmonies and ravishing changes of tone. (This might be the place to note that Jonny Greenwood composed the score). Like “There Will Be Blood,” it casts Mr. Day-Lewis as an avatar of obsession, driven this time by the pursuit of aesthetic perfection rather than money and power. But whereas Daniel Plainview in the earlier film was a vector of pure, demonic ambition, Reynolds Woodcock bemusedly discovers himself to be one leg of a complicated emotional triangle.The other sides are Cyril and Alma (Vicky Krieps), a non-British waitress in a provincial British restaurant who becomes Reynolds’s model, mistress and muse. Usually this is a temporary assignment. We briefly meet Alma’s predecessor, Johanna (Camilla Rutherford), who annoys Reynolds at breakfast and is dismissed offscreen by Cyril, with one of Reynolds’s old dresses as a consolation prize. Johanna’s sin is to request some of her lover’s attention, a demand he regards as intrusive and distracting.That dynamic will repeat itself with Alma, who butters her toast too noisily, pours tea with too much splashing and boldly asserts her right to exist as something more than an ornament in the Woodcock household. The battle of wills that ensues — a two-front war for Alma, who must contend with both Woodcock siblings — is the film’s dramatic furnace and its comic engine. The three main performances are each as richly textured and subtly shaded as the clothes. Mr. Day-Lewis composes a symphony of moods: sardonic, melancholy, inspired, impatient. But he is matched by Ms. Krieps, an actress from Luxembourg as canny and unintimidated as Alma herself. Is this collaboration or competition? A tango or a tennis match? Whatever it is, this partnership is thrilling to watch: funny, wrenching, full of large and small surprises.The difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true.Like a garment that can be worn with the lining on the outside, “Phantom Thread” reverses itself, almost imperceptibly flipping from Reynolds’s point of view to Alma’s and back again. She succumbs, at first, to what is most likely a well-practiced campaign of seduction: Reynolds flirts with her at breakfast, invites her to dinner, takes her back to his country house and sets about making her a dress. What she regards as her physical flaws — small breasts, broad shoulders, wide hips — he sees as signs of perfection. She is dazzled by his ability to be dazzled by her.But then, when the spell seems about to wear off, Alma refuses to let it. She rejects the shabby bargain Reynolds offers her, which demands the complete suppression of her will in exchange for his occasional recognition of her existence. “I live here,” she says to a client who might otherwise have assumed she was just another seamstress. She fights for her position in the household, trying to outmaneuver Cyril and to force Reynolds to recognize her as his equal. There is some temerity in this, and some novelty in the way Mr. Anderson depicts their relationship. The wives of artists in movies and literature tend to be doormats or helpmeets, and their psychic anguish and creative fire rarely move from background to center stage.Is Alma a feminist heroine? Some version of that question is likely to fuel more than a few post-screening arguments. Your answer may depend on what you think of the mushroom omelet that is the movie’s spoiler-proof surprise. There are other things to talk about. On first viewing, the captivating strangeness of the mood and the elegant threading of the plot are likely to hold your attention, but later you can go back to savor the lustrous colors, the fine-grained performances and the romantic mystery that holds the whole thing together.What kind of love story is “Phantom Thread”? The wrenching tale of a woman’s love for a man and a man’s love for his work. A dry, comic study of the asymmetries and conflicts at the heart of a marriage. A refined gothic nightmare in the manner of Henry James. A perverse psychological fable of unchecked ego and unhinged desire. That’s a partial catalog, and one that can’t quite capture how bizarre this movie is. Or how bizarrely true to life — to art, to love, to itself — it feels.","Vicky Krieps, Daniel Day-Lewis, Lesley Manville, Julie Vollono","&pound;947,190","USA, UK",Paul Thomas Anderson,"Drama, Romance","English, French",90,"Set in 1950's London, Reynolds Woodcock is a renowned dressmaker whose fastidious life is disrupted by a young, strong-willed woman, Alma, who becomes his muse and lover.",R,Focus Features,"[{'Value': '7.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",19 Jan 2018,130 min,Phantom Thread,Paul Thomas Anderson,2017,7.6,"70,864","[{'Value': '7.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '91%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '90/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",phantom thread,Phantom Thread,Focus Features,63340.0,-23.0,4.0,15835.0,527840.0,7.0,17531.0
3,GLENN KENNY,1,2018-01-21 17:44:02,Happy End,"Review: In ‘Happy End,’ Another Unhappy Family From Michael Haneke",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/movies/happy-end-review-michael-haneke.html,2017-12-22,2017-12-21,"Isabelle Huppert, Toby Jones and Mathieu Kassovitz make up a remarkable ensemble cast. But “Happy End” belongs to Jean-Louis Trintignant.","If you are even only a little familiar with the work of the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, it will come as no surprise that he does not regard instant messaging and smartphones as positive developments for humanity. His latest picture, “Happy End,” begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone, its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman’s routine.Mr. Haneke, whose technical mastery often makes his considered existential dyspepsia easier to swallow, doesn’t establish an explicit motivation for the spy — the 13-year-old Eve, the second-youngest member of the singularly unhappy Laurent family, whose story this movie tells. The Laurents, a most high-bourgeois clan, are besieged by trouble. Its patriarch, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), retains some mental sharpness in his 80s, but he’s losing his memory, and he’d like to get out — that is, die — while he still has some faculties left. His son Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz) has brought his daughter Eve (Fantine Harduin) to stay with him and his new wife and baby after Eve’s mother attempted suicide. (Thomas also has a mistress, whom Eve learns about while cyber-eavesdropping on her father.) They are all living in the family’s Calais mansion with Eve’s aunt, Anne (Isabelle Huppert), who is trying to keep the family construction business afloat, a task not helped much by her wayward son, Pierre (Franz Rogowski), or a fatal accident at a building site.“Happy End” has a linear structure, but Mr. Haneke presents his scenes with little or no connective tissue. Instead of conventional transitions, there are abrupt shifts that resemble clicking through channels on a television. A scene of domestic disorder will cut to a web video in which an adolescent boy giddily chronicles his hair and skateboarding styles from videos past, and the movie lets this clip roll on quite a while before showing us that it’s something Eve is watching on her computer. This strategy has a distancing effect, but also forces the viewer to stay on his or her toes.It also constitutes a bit of misdirection, in that there is a bigger picture outside of this chronicle of self-absorption. The Laurents, as what some would call wealth creators, have, in Mr. Haneke’s view, some responsibility to and for a whole class of people who aren’t even abstractions to them. Aside from their servants, members of the working class — both the documented and undocumented — are not often seen in this movie, but the times they are made visible are significant. They appear at key points in the movie, as when Georges, in a wheelchair after his attempted suicide-by-car fails, rolls down a street, festooned with tacky little shops, and stops in front of a group of men, most likely African immigrants. We can’t hear what he’s asking of them, but we can guess. The character’s presumption is staggering on several levels.Like many of Mr. Haneke’s films from the past two decades, “Happy End” is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne’s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in “My Night at Maud’s,” released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in “A Man and a Woman,” 1966) or a fascist dupe (in “The Conformist,” 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie’s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit.","Isabelle Huppert, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Mathieu Kassovitz, Fantine Harduin","&pound;83,292","France, Austria, Germany",Michael Haneke,Drama,"French, English",72,A drama about a family set in Calais with the European refugee crisis as the backdrop.,R,Les Films du Losange,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Dec 2017,107 min,Happy End,Michael Haneke,2017,6.8,"8,566","[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '70%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '72/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",happy end,,,,,,,,,

Russell. “Father Figures” doesn’t merely flirt. It stars Ed Helms as Peter and Owen Wilson as Kyle, two of the least-related-seeming twins in history. On the day their mother (Glenn Close) marries some cool cat played by Harry Shearer, they learn that their father isn’t dead, as they thought, but just unknown. Mom didn’t practice monogamy in the disco era.And so the brothers venture out to meet their father. The contenders include Terry Bradshaw (playing himself), who seems thrilled to have Peter to toss around a football with but pays no attention to Kyle, and Roland (J.K. Simmons), who would just as soon betray or shoot his sons as bond with them. Kyle and Peter also pick up a hitchhiker (Katt Williams) who becomes a mediator for their bickering.Distinguished mainly by its overqualified cast and lack of inspiration, “Father Figures” can’t decide whether it’s a gross-out comedy or an uplifting tale of brotherly love; it embraces the worst of both worlds. When not lobbing jokes about prostates, possible incest and mammoth cat testicles, the movie stops cold for Mr. Helms and Mr. Wilson (who can act, on the basis of other movies) to muddle through one heart-to-heart after another. “Father Figures” purports to run about two hours, but it feels like the length of Kyle and Peter’s upbringing.","Robert Jon Mello, Ed Helms, Retta, Zachary Haven","$16,772,934",USA,Lawrence Sher,Comedy,English,22,"Upon learning that their mother has been lying to them for years about their allegedly deceased father, two fraternal twin brothers hit the road in order to find him.",R,Warner Bros.

Cops, but Little Magic",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/movies/bright-review-will-smith-joel-edgerton.html,2017-12-22,2017-12-21,"David Ayer’s urban action film is a loud, ungainly hybrid that does not serve police procedurals or fantasy spectaculars very well.","With the buddy-cop fantasy “Bright,” Will Smith and the director David Ayer attempt to chart new territory: an urban action film populated not only by humans but also fantastical creatures like centaurs, fairies, orcs and elves. (If you’re unfamiliar with orcs, check your J. R. R. Tolkien.) The result is a loud, ungainly hybrid that does not serve police procedurals or fantasy spectaculars very well.Written by Max Landis (whose scripts for “Mr. Right” and the BBC series “Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency” have also crossbred genres), “Bright” wastes little time with nettlesome back story about how mythological beings entered our present. Mostly, we simply see that the pointy-eared elves and the swarthy orcs have their own districts in Los Angeles, and two partner patrolmen — the human Daryl Ward (Mr. Smith) and an Orc, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton, deftly evincing character from under mottled makeup) — maintain the peace. Daryl resents Nick for having fumbled an arrest that left Daryl sidelined for weeks, and, like many of his colleagues, he also distrusts Nick, the first orc hired by the department. (The racism metaphor is entirely intentional. There’s even a slur: pigface.)In fact, a small cadre of corrupt officers wants Nick eliminated. And a new threat arrives: Leilah (a hammy yet almost silent Noomi Rapace), a lethal elf serving a malevolent entity called, yes, the Dark Lord. Leilah is after Tikka (Lucy Fry), an elf who has taken possession of a glowing magic wand emitting great destructive energy. When Daryl and Nick (who speaks Elvish) take Tikka under their protection, the three are pursued not only by cops but also by Leilah and her ruthless cronies; a Latino street gang after the wand, led by the nasty Poison (Enrique Murciano); and operatives of a federal Magic Task Force (Edgar Ramirez and Happy Anderson).

6,A.O. SCOTT,0,2018-01-21 17:44:02,Downsizing,"Review: In ‘Downsizing,’ Matt Damon Sweats the Small Stuff",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/movies/downsizing-review-matt-damon-kristen-wiig.html,2017-12-22,2017-12-21,Alexander Payne looks at the big picture in his new movie.,"One of my favorite movies of 2017, “War for the Planet of the Apes,” posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine.Alexander Payne’s new movie, “Downsizing,” doesn’t go nearly as far. Surveying a landscape of impending ecological catastrophe, it proposes a future that is only mildly dystopian and prescribes laughter rather than apocalyptic despair as, if not exactly a remedy, then at least an acceptable palliative. We don’t need to disappear altogether, but it might be better all around if we weren’t so darn big.Mr. Payne’s title refers not to corporate cost-saving strategies but to a technological procedure invented by scientists in Norway and adapted for universal, commercial use. People are efficiently and almost painlessly shrunk to around four or five inches. This is sold as an environmental panacea: Our tiny selves will take less of a toll on the earth’s resources and produce less waste. The burden we impose on our hot, crowded planet is expected to decrease proportionally.But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn’t that you consume less; it’s that you can have a whole lot more. That’s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong?Mr. Payne, who wrote “Downsizing” with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract — in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of “the small” — who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite — is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven’t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers.Mr. Damon’s regular-guy affability carries the movie through its expository phase, which is a lot of fun. Mr. Payne has an admirably concrete logistical sense and an eye for amusing incongruities. The transition from big to small is full of clever touches, like the spatulas that lift the newly shrunken out of their suddenly oversize beds, as if they were freshly baked one-bite cookies.Paul, big and small, is just interesting enough to be good company. He is friendly, but with that hint of heartland hostility that is layered into every Alexander Payne hero’s temperament like a smear of hot mustard in a bologna-and-cheese sandwich. Paul’s passivity gives the movie a leisurely rhythm unusual in both science fiction and satire, the two genres that “Downsizing” nods toward without fully embracing.Instead, the movie resembles an episode of “The Twilight Zone” directed by Preston Sturges. An outlandish, pointedly allegorical conceit is inhabited not by symbolic figures but by terrestrial oddballs. You don’t see this at first, because Mr. Payne is so charmed by the conceit itself. Like a video gamer uninterested in winning and in no hurry to advance to higher levels, he knocks around the corners and side streets of his invented reality, treating it the way he treated Hawaii in “The Descendants,” wine country in “Sideways” and his beloved Nebraska in most of his other movies — as a picturesque, lived-in backdrop for the spectacle of human ridiculousness.About an hour in, “Downsizing” amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we’ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul’s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau’s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity.And then, with a bit of a thud, this kinetic and good-natured movie discovers its limitations and shrinks before our eyes. Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor, roaming freely in their conjoined imaginations, wander off into the bushes and then stumble into the middle of the road. Paul’s journey loses direction and momentum, and sour, nagging questions begin to intrude. Haven’t we seen this story before, in which a white man’s anomie is cured by the love of an exotic woman? Did we come all this way to rediscover the ouroboros of guilty liberal self-consciousness?Well, yes, as it turns out. But then again the whole point of the movie is the scaling down of expectations to arrive at something like an accurate sense of scale, and disappointment may be a perverse sign of success. “Downsizing” is an ambitious movie about the value of modesty, and its faults are proportionate to its insights. I sort of wish it felt like a bigger deal, but maybe that’s my problem.","Matt Damon, Christoph Waltz, Hong Chau, Kristen Wiig","&pound;22,932,429","USA, Norway",Alexander Payne,"Drama, Sci-Fi","English, Spanish, Norwegian, French, Korean, Greek, Vietnamese",63,"A social satire in which a man realizes he would have a better life if he were to shrink himself to five inches tall, allowing him to live in wealth and splendor.",R,Paramount Pictures,"[{'Value': '5.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Dec 2017,135 min,Downsizing,"Alexander Payne, Jim Taylor",2017,5.7,"62,376","[{'Value': '5.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '50%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '63/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",downsizing,Downsizing,Paramount Pictures,1273053.0,-31.0,2664.0,478.0,17160674.0,10.0,17531.0

This documentary lets viewers judge.,"“A German Life” is likely to be the last new movie of its kind: a documentary that presents contemporary testimony from someone who witnessed the inner workings of the Nazi high command. The movie is taken from 30 hours of interviews with Brunhilde Pomsel, who served as a secretary to Joseph Goebbels and was 103 when the film was shot. (She died in January at 106.)Like “Blind Spot: Hitler’s Secretary,” which centered on the recollections of Traudl Junge, “A German Life” lets viewers consider its subject — her anecdotes, body language and face (often shot in close-up) — and decide how much to believe her. The words of Ms. Pomsel, who is remarkably lucid for a centenarian, are intercut with quotations from Goebbels and archival footage from both sides of the war. Viewers are implicitly invited to ponder the contrast.“I’m not the kind of person to resist,” she says at one point, adding, “I’m one of the cowards.” Noting that nobody believes her, she says she only learned about “the matter of the Jews” when she returned from Russian prison camps after the war. Yet one of the recurring characters in her stories is a Jewish friend, Eva Löwenthal, whom records indicate was deported to Auschwitz and, in 1945, declared dead.Ms. Pomsel’s obituary noted her contradictory statements in this film and other interviews. “I didn’t do anything but type in Goebbels’s office,” she says near the movie’s end. “And I had no idea of what was behind all that. Well, very little, anyway.”",Brunhilde Pomsel,N/A,Austria,"Christian Krönes, Olaf S.

This intermittently diverting movie is adapted from a 1949 Agatha Christie novel, and it’s several degrees more engaging than another recent Christie-based movie, “Murder on the Orient Express.” But it’s still slight.Max Irons plays the young private eye Charles Hayward, who gets a visit in his dingy office from the beautiful Sophia (Stefanie Martini), an old love whose grandfather, an unpopular tycoon, has shuffled off this mortal coil under unusual circumstances. After consulting with the vinegary Scotland Yard hand Chief Inspector Taverner (Terence Stamp, always welcome), Charles sets out to the estate, filled with aunts, sons, in-laws and others, embodied by an all-star cast including Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Gillian Anderson and Christina Hendricks. Ms. Hendricks, her distinctive red hair here a vermilion that borders on magenta, plays an ex-showgirl who is the last wife of the dead old man.The movie’s director, Gilles Paquet-Brenner, worked on the adaptation with Julian Fellowes, writer of Robert Altman’s acclaimed 2001 mansion mystery “Gosford Park.” At its best, as when Ms. Hendricks swans around her cavernous bedroom bopping to early rock ’n’ roll records, the movie feels like a version of “Gosford Park” taken over by François Ozon. But “Crooked House” is not so often this giddy. The superb cast provides mild pleasures, as do some aspects of the elaborate mystery itself.

But it certainly offers plenty to occupy the eye. Rarely has a director so reveled in the possibilities of digital effects (with the exception of Robert Rodriguez during his “Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl” period). That said, story clarity and emotional depth tend to evaporate amid the visual pyrotechnics.The story, adapted from a web comic by Joo Ho-min, concerns an earnest, heroic firefighter (Cha Tae-hyun) who, when he is killed in the line of duty, becomes a candidate for reincarnation. But first he must face seven judges in the afterlife who review key moments in his existence. Fortunately he is represented by three guardians (Ha Jung-woo, Ju Ji-hoon and the charming actress Kim Hyang-gi) who defend his eligibility. En route to these celestial magistrates, the four pass through perilous realms with names like the Volcano of the Damned, Murder Hell and the Blade Forest, battling the computer-animated likes of toothy fish with humanoid heads and so-called hell ghouls, with glowing red weapons vaguely resembling light sabers.Greatly complicating matters is a subplot about the firefighter’s soldier brother, whose death at the hands of another trooper is covered up, turning the brother into a malevolent spirit. But all is forgiven in a riot of tearful Hallmark sentimentality that Mr. Kim has the good sense to gently pillory. It all proves exasperating, and yet, yes, a sequel is teased at the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This time, the killer carves letters into the victims’ bodies, spelling out a message in a tribute to the children’s word game Hangman. The slick, music video-style opening credits — a staple of this genre since “Seven” — include an ominous box of crayons.Mr. Pacino plays Ray, a veteran detective who, after being implicated by the killer, comes out of retirement to investigate with his former colleague Will (Karl Urban), a haunted ex-F.B.I. agent. Will is being shadowed by a New York Times journalist (Brittany Snow) who has returned to her hometown to report on what policing is like there and just happens to luck into a serial killer, as if chasing psychopaths with fiendishly convoluted plans were all that heart-of-America cops did.The killer’s linguistic skills aren’t his only talent. He leaves a body for the detectives every night at precisely 11 p.m., with clues on where to find the next one. As the cops ponder forensics, none show the slightest interest in solving the word puzzle, which looks like a big honking hint.

We are reintroduced to the group’s reluctant leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick), as she quits a demeaning record label job. In the same vein, Chloe (Brittany Snow) endures veterinary school, while Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) coasts on her Fat Amy Winehouse impersonation. Discouraged by the demands of the real world, the larger-than-life Bellas reunite to join a U.S.O. tour, where they vie to perform as the opening act for the record producer DJ Khaled (appearing as himself).With the Bellas removed from their natural collegiate habitat, the a cappella competitions that once drove the series feel out of place. Though there is novelty in casting a contemporary artist like DJ Khaled in the movie’s kingmaker role, his presence is a reminder that the demands of real-world pop are very different from the demands of this franchise’s fantasy version of a cappella. Watching the Bellas mash together pop songs without sound mixing or instruments in Khaled’s presence feels at best obligatory and at worst embarrassing.“Pitch Perfect 3” fares best when its director, Trish Sie, treats it as a fantastical buddy comedy. A side plot reuniting Fat Amy with her degenerate father (John Lithgow) nearly takes over the movie when Amy’s father kidnaps the Bellas. What follows is the film’s funniest scene, as the suddenly spry Amy, in an attempt to save her friends, refashions sausages into nunchucks and sandwich tinfoil into explosives. In another divergence, the Bellas destroy a hotel suite, releasing a swarm of bees and lighting curtains on fire to the horror of party guests.With a plot as unfocused as its freshly graduated characters, the shaggy “Pitch Perfect 3” gets by on karaoke logic: What makes for a good time isn’t the song you sing, but the company you keep.","Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp","$104,880,310",USA,Trish Sie,"Comedy, Music","English, Papiamento",40,"Following their win at the world championship, the now separated Bellas reunite for one last singing competition at an overseas USO tour, but face a group who uses both instruments and voices.",PG-13,Universal Pictures,"[{'Value': '5.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Dec 2017,93 min,Pitch Perfect 3,"Kay Cannon (screenplay by), Mike White (screenplay by), Kay Cannon (story by), Mickey Rapkin (based on the book by)",2017,5.9,"37,090","[{'Value': '5.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '32%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '40/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",pitch perfect 3,Pitch Perfect 3,Universal,3565285.0,-46.0,3468.0,1028.0,63300605.0,10.0,17531.0

Barnum Smaller Than Life",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/movies/the-greatest-showman-review-hugh-jackman.html,2017-12-20,2017-12-20,"The film has the ingredients of a splashy good time — the charismatic Hugh Jackman, for one — but it fast becomes a standard-issue holiday biopic.","Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.”What fun is that?Even after the long-running circus bearing his name closed up shop this year, P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There’s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: “We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.”“The Greatest Showman,” a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It’s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right.“Showman” has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year’s hit movie “La La Land” (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show “Dear Evan Hansen” (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn’t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn’t get any wittier than that.Not much time is wasted on Barnum’s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories.Playing the role of a skeptical theater critic as the joyless foil to the giddy fun inspired by Barnum, Paul Sparks maintains a stern deadpan, the way reviewers in movies do. As Barnum’s wife, Charity, Michelle Williams gazes adoringly, until rumors in the press of his affair with Ms. Lind prompt her eyelids to fall in disappointment.The repercussions of this domestic drama are predictable, but at least they do lead to a delightful redemptive scene (one of the movie’s few pleasingly dreamlike moments), when Barnum uses an elephant as a New York taxi to make an appointment on time. It’s utter nonsense — imagine finding a parking space — but that’s exactly what a movie about the self-proclaimed “Prince of Humbugs” needs.","Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya","$164,616,443",USA,Michael Gracey,"Biography, Drama, Musical",English,48,Celebrates the birth of show business and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.,PG,20th Century Fox,"[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",20 Dec 2017,105 min,The Greatest Showman,"Jenny Bicks (screenplay by), Bill Condon (screenplay by), Jenny Bicks (story by)",2017,7.7,"156,491","[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '56%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '48/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the greatest showman,The Greatest Showman,20th Century Fox,4436321.0,-23.0,3316.0,1338.0,49036718.0,12.0,17531.0

The movie opens in 1996 with a young man finding the now-discarded board game that wreaked such havoc on its players in the 1995 Robin Williams movie. The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen’s console, something strange happens.The movie cuts to the present day and introduces four archetypal, irritating teen characters. There’s the smart and awkward Spencer; his former best friend “Fridge,” now a high school football star who makes Spencer do his homework; the selfie-obsessed popular girl, Bethany; and Martha, who’s a diluted variation of Allison, the smartest and angriest girl in the room in “The Breakfast Club.” And much like in that movie, these kids all get detention together.At first, I presumed that the film’s increased attention on these teenagers was to make us that much more eager for the stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black to show up. There’s good news and bad news: We meet the marquee names shortly after detention. Only they are portraying those same irritating teen characters.I’ll explain. The actual teens discover the discarded video game console in the detention room. They plug it in, the game boots up, and the kids choose their characters. Then they get sucked into the game, where they, among other things, meet the fellow who got sucked into the game 20 years before.The movie derives its humor, such as it is, from the teens’ avatar choices. The nerd gets to be Dwayne Johnson. The big football player gets to be Kevin Hart (who, it is frequently noted, is not tall). The shy, awkward Martha gets to be an expert in dance-fighting (played by Karen Gillan). And the selfie-obsessed girl gets to be, surprise, Jack Black. The crew must navigate a mission that involves a large gem and a villain (Bobby Cannavale) who has insects crawling in and out of his mouth more regularly than is considered normal.Their adventure often asks, “What would Steven Spielberg do?” It then answers poorly. (The movie’s director, Jake Kasdan, happens to be the son of Lawrence Kasdan, who worked as a screenwriter with Mr. Spielberg on “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”) The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right. Ms. Gillan, the lesser-known quantity of the group, has to work harder as the geeky teen comes to enjoy living, even if temporarily, in a bombshell adult package.

Arguing poverty, Auralie’s mother and father take her to a beauty-training salon for the procedure, and her-once slack locks, left in tight curlers too long, are majorly poofed. Her hair looks like Bob Dylan’s on the cover of his landmark album “Blonde on Blonde.” That was great for Dylan in 1966 New York, but not so much for an adolescent girl “somewhere in Virginia,” according to a title card, in 1982.Written and directed by Colette Burson, “Permanent” uses hair and hairstyles as a metaphor for self-worth. Besides Auralie’s unfortunate situation, Jim, a former Air Force One steward now trying to get through med school, is attached to a very unconvincing toupee. The metaphor goes limp after about 20 minutes. This family comedy then flails about, serving up coming-of-age anecdotes involving mean girls, karate classes and sexually predatory boys. One new “friend” of Auralie’s is eager to show her his penis (what is it with guys, anyway?), which, he insists, looks like E.T. The movie wraps up by cashing in on an interracial friendship subplot for Auralie, a putative feel-good flourish that just feels unearned, to say the least.As the parents, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Arquette seem just about as tired as the characters they’re playing.

As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.Were it not for the director’s steady hand and adamantine focus on her destination, this ambition could have been the film’s undoing. Instead, its scope is stirring, the gradual accumulation of insult and outrage reaching far beyond tiny Abbeville where the crime occurred and where Recy, then 24, lived with her husband and new daughter. The miracle, though, is that the movie isn’t a diatribe. Its voices — including several members of Recy’s family and that of Rosa Parks herself, who investigated the assault — are gentle and persuasive, using the horrific details of the rape and its aftermath as ballast to stabilize a heart-wrenching history of systemic injustice.The cleverness of this structure only gradually becomes apparent as Ms. Buirski slowly obliterates skin tone distinctions to land on a perfectly calibrated final section. Some may chide her, not without cause, for overreaching; yet the emotional impact of her deep-diving images — especially the astonishing clips from the “race films” of the 1940s and earlier — is profound. An evocative shot of a black woman in a white dress, fleeing from someone in graceful terror, reminds us repeatedly of the movie’s original atrocity.“They played in her body,” Recy’s sister Alma Daniels says at one point. It’s perhaps the most devastating claim in a film overflowing with them.","Tommy Bernardi, Robert Corbitt, Alma Daniels, Cynthia Erivo",N/A,USA,Nancy Buirski,Documentary,English,73,"Mrs. Recy Taylor was gang raped by six white boys in 1944 Alabama.

Mariam Shaar leads a modest food business in Bourj el Barajneh, a refugee camp south of Beirut, Lebanon, comprising decrepit buildings, narrow alleys and a dangerous overhead mishmash of electrical wires. Despite her status as a Palestinian — barred, as with Syrian refugees, from better jobs in Beirut — Ms. Shaar grows her company, Soufra (which means a table of delicious plenty), with other women struggling to transcend their social station.Crisply directed by Thomas Morgan, the film depicts a succession of challenges facing Ms. Shaar, a smart, understated and tenacious entrepreneur. Soufra begins as a company that races to raise Kickstarter money (with assistance from the Saudi philanthropical concern Alfanar), then expands into schools, upscale gatherings and a farmer’s market, and finally into a food truck, the acquisition of which provides much of the movie’s tension. Fortunately, Ms, Shaar has resourceful and engaged helpers — including the good-humored Ghada Masrieh and diligent Abeer Hassan Almassry — who share her determination and persistence. “You realize your worth,” says Manal Hassan, a mother of five, of working for Soufra. “Especially in these times, women can do anything.”After an initial rejection, Ms. Shaar waits — and waits and waits — for government licenses to purchase the truck, and we see not only the prejudice facing Palestinians in Beirut but also those facing women in particular. Still, she persists, learning to drive, buying culinary technology for the vehicle, and establishing a stand. Ultimately, Ms. Shaar’s triumphs seem boundless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a pig who sails a boat, a team of father-and-son garbage-scavenging rats, a little fox named Little Fox and a dog who is training to be a police officer.But this is not a cute movie, and while it will intrigue many 10- and 11-year-olds, younger children are likely to be more than a little freaked out. Its enchantments are dark, its ideas somber and brutal. Adapted by Pedro Rivero and Alberto Vázquez from Mr. Vázquez’s graphic novel, the film, originally called “Psiconautas” (“Psychonauts”), conjures a bleak vision of a post- or perhaps mid-apocalyptic landscape of predation, addiction and demonic possession. So maybe it’s actually the perfect children’s entertainment for 2017.Birdboy is a creature with an enormous round head and a tiny beak who dresses in a black suit, white shirt and skinny tie, like a member of the “Reservoir Dogs” cast or of an ’80s ska revival band. The lighthouse he once called home is infested by demonic birds, so he flaps around looking for drugs and trying not to get shot.The island where he and the other animals live has been blighted by a nuclear accident. The trees are bare, and the population is divided between a countryside of tidy houses, forests and open fields, and an industrial zone heaped with refuse and ruled by the law of the jungle. Life is pretty awful for everyone. Dinky, who is more or less the heroine of the story (and turns out to be Birdboy’s former girlfriend), quietly seethes in the company of her grotesque mother and stepfather. Her schoolmate Sandra is tormented by voices in her head. Their friend Little Fox is bullied.A lot of incident is packed into a 76-minute running time, giving “Birdboy” the scale of a miniature epic. It’s a little too much, and especially toward the end, the delicate originality of the imagery gives way to familiar movie tropes. (The final moments jarringly evoke “Avatar,” of all things.) But the simple precision of the hand-drawn characters and of the watercolor world they inhabit provide visual coherence and establish an atmosphere of fascination as well as dread.

Published in 1936 with the Spanish Civil War on the horizon, the book, interpreted as pacifist propaganda, found enemies on both sides.“Ferdinand,” the new computer-animated adaptation from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies), speaks to its own time in a different way, dutifully adhering to the template for contemporary children’s films while avoiding much personality or distinction. The be-yourself messaging is easy to comprehend. A growing-up montage is set to an original Nick Jonas song that sounds like ideal music to get put on hold to. The farm animals represent a cross-section of nations, from a Scottish Highland bull (voiced by David Tennant) to German horses. And the movie is bright and peppy enough to hold young viewers’ attention, though a faithful 1938 Walt Disney short showed more inventiveness in eight minutes.The expanded adventures of Ferdinand (John Cena as an adult) find him encountering new friends, including a misfit goat (Kate McKinnon, whose freewheeling comedy style doesn’t register in the cartoon format) and three hedgehogs (Gina Rodriguez, Daveed Diggs and Gabriel Iglesias). He buries the hatchet with the bulls who bullied him as a child. For some reason, Peyton Manning lends his voice to the one who always has an upset stomach.Unlike in the book, Ferdinand earns the arena’s cheers for not fighting, but the crowd’s sense of surprise will elude audiences attending “Ferdinand.”","Jack Gore, Jet Jurgensmeyer, Nile Diaz, Colin H.

A stalled truck forces the two to take the subway, at which time their city is subject to a very gnarly alien attack.The prospect of a hybrid of “Battle: Los Angeles” (2011) and Andrzev Wajda’s “Kanal” (1956) is not necessarily displeasing, but as it happens, “Beyond Skyline,” written and directed by Liam O’Donnell, is much, much more. (Among other things, it’s a kind of sequel to the 2010 film “Skyline,” for which Mr. O’Donnell was one of the two screenwriters, retaining its aliens but jettisoning its characters.)Fleeing the invaders via subway tunnels doesn’t work, so soon Mark, Trent and a few stock types are in an alien ship, besieged by fearsome creatures with tentacles that unscrew the tops of human heads. One of the captives is a blind Vietnam vet, which is interesting, because eventually the alien ship crashes in Laos, right on the Mekong River, where Mark must protect the newborn he delivered on the ship. (Long story.) The movie, which lists several Asian companies as co-producers, then morphs into a sci-fi martial arts picture, featuring a scene in which a woman lures a giant alien beast into a minefield.Whether you find this as much fun to watch as it is to describe will depend on your tolerance for clichés in dialogue (“I’m so sorry your family is gone. But killing yourself … is not gonna change that”), music (lots of string sections syncopating in high register) and much else. Also in how credible you find Mr. Grillo as an action star.

Ms. Haysom pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact, but Mr. Soering has maintained that he is not guilty and that he gave a false confession, later recanted, to protect Ms. Haysom, counting on his father’s status as a diplomat to shield him.Over the years, Mr. Soering has won allies who have contended his innocence or argued for his repatriation to Germany, where he holds citizenship. The documentary, which features a lengthy prison interview with him, is hardly the first reconsideration of the case. (In 2010, while serving as the state’s governor, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia recommended approval of Mr. Soering’s request to be sent to Germany, where he would serve in prison, though Mr. Kaine’s successor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, reversed that decision.) The movie’s existence and findings have been mentioned in lengthy examinations of the crime in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.Marcus Vetter and Karin Steinberger’s sprawling documentary probably dives into the weeds too quickly and could have used a tighter edit. Still, drawing on a wealth of courtroom video, the film lays out a persuasive argument for reasonable doubt.Those who contribute information favorable to Mr. Soering include Gail Marshall, a former deputy attorney general of Virginia, and Chuck Reid, one of the original investigators. Mr. Soering comes across as a sincere and canny camera presence.

A psycho-in-the-woods tale whose villain is more funny-looking than alarming, this debut effort from the director Sam Patton is notable mainly for the beautifully organic performances of its two female leads. In tandem with Matt Anderson and Michael Larson-Kangas’s surprisingly sensitive script, the women create a believably intimate bond between their beleaguered characters.Both are unsettled from the outset. Abby (Jaimi Paige), recently widowed, is struggling to reconcile her grief with that of her 13-year-old son, Sam (Toby Nichols). At the same time, her longtime friend Jen (Alyshia Ochse) is surveying the emotional gaps in her own life and mulling a major decision. All three have hiked into the wilderness to scatter the deceased’s ashes on his favorite mountain; behind them, a hooded stranger (Claude Duhamel) silently follows.For a long time, this mystery stalker does little but lurk, periodically releasing spooky blasts of vintage music — presumably to get his hack-’em-up mojo going. Though with neither dialogue nor obvious motivation, he’s less a character than an abstract mechanism to force an emotional catharsis: a trigger for mother and son to reboot and reconnect.This repeated tilt toward tenderness slackens the tension, and, as Andi Obarski’s camera sweeps swiftly past the nasty bits, we sense that neither she nor her director is gung-ho for gore. Instead, they give their leads a gift rarely bestowed on attractive young women in horror movies: to be observed without being fetishized.","Toby Nichols, Jaimi Paige, Alyshia Ochse, Claude Duhamel",N/A,USA,Sam Patton,"Drama, Horror, Thriller",English,N/A,A mother takes her son and her best friend on a trip into remote wilderness to scatter his father's ashes; they must confront their fears when a lone hiker begins following them.,NOT RATED,Desolated Productions,"[{'Value': '4.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",15 Dec 2017,78 min,Desolation,"Matt Anderson, Michael Larson-Kangas",2017,4.6,695,"[{'Value': '4.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '64%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}]",desolation,,,,,,,,,

John Wayne delivers that same admonition in “Rio Bravo,” Howard Hawks’s 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful, autocratic rancher. (Wayne’s sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy, played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways, that film and other classics from the western canon inform “Lefty Brown,” which opens one dark, stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889, the year it became the 41st state.One of the foundational themes of the western is the making of America, an origin story that plays out in tales about frontiers, borders, wagon trains, settlements, railroads, towns, cowboys and Indians. Invariably, these are narratives of violent transformations in which land becomes property and some people become citizens while others remain outlaws or are turned into permanent exiles. In “Lefty Brown,” those changes have already affected a Montana rancher, Edward Johnson (Peter Fonda), who has recently been elected a senator and is headed east. He’s a classic type, the outsider as insider who, as he tells his wife, Laura (Kathy Baker), is “going to take on all of Washington.”Some 10 minutes into the film, though, a villain fatally derails Edward’s plans, spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edward’s longtime hand, Lefty (Bill Pullman), of failing her husband. (“You were supposed to watch his back,” a grieving Laura tells an apologetic, equally bereft Lefty. “Sorry don’t get it done.”) Lefty sets off to find Edward’s killer, a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler, Jeremiah (Diego Josef), who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels, some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Lefty’s past.The writer-director Jared Moshé takes his time in “Lefty Brown,” which meanders here and there for close to two hours, ranging over picturesque, Big Sky landscapes while rambling deeper into prickly narrative complications. If there isn’t much urgency it’s partly because Lefty has been rather too closely modeled on the irascible if endearing coots played by the likes of Walter Brennan. Often grizzled comic relief, though sometimes tragic, these sidemen stand in the long, tall shadow of the hero, giving him grief while always following his lead. They’re loyal dogs, surrogate nannies, maybe close pals. They’re types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Moshé has given Lefty.Like Brennan’s character, Stumpy, in “Rio Bravo,” Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickens’s warble, too.) At times, Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations, which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movie’s modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time, as the too familiar story of good men and bad, loyalty and betrayal emerges, these allusions can remind you that you’re not watching Howard Hawks.

24,MANOHLA DARGIS,1,2018-01-12 17:44:02,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,Review: ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ Embraces the Magic and Mystery,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-review.html,2017-12-15,2017-12-12,"With charm and wit, the latest “Star Wars” movie unites the past and present as it looks toward the future.","Evil is ascendant. The Resistance — an intrepid, multi-everything group whose leaders include a battle-tested woman warrior — has been fighting the good fight for years but is outnumbered and occasionally outmaneuvered. Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” picks up where the story left off two years ago in “The Force Awakens,” the leadoff of the series’ newest trilogy. Keeping track of where each “Star Wars” title fits into the overall scheme of things can be brain-numbing (the movies weren’t made in story-chronological order), but the strongest ones work as stand-alones and let you just go with the onscreen flow. The writer-director of “The Last Jedi,” Rian Johnson, frontloads the critical back story intel — who’s fighting who and the like — in the opening crawl. And then he gets down to the difficult business of putting his fingerprints on a franchise that deliberately resists individual authorship.Mr. Johnson largely succeeds despite having inherited an elaborate ecosystem with a Manichaean worldview divided between heroes (a.k.a. the Resistance) and villains (the First Order). That’s about all you need to know to follow this movie, which charts the franchise’s future while continuing to pass the baton from its first holy trinity — Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill — to a new trio, introduced in “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Ford’s character, Han Solo, exited the series in that movie. As Leia, Ms. Fisher plays a critical role in this new one, but her death last December (after production ended) imparts real melancholy to a series that from its start has been defined — if not always comfortably — by loss.And so, once upon a time yet again, peace remains elusive and weapons are locked, loaded and often firing. Here, the fight continues with Leia searching for her absent brother, Luke Skywalker (Mr. Hamill), while leading the Resistance against the First Order, the dark-side successor to the dictatorial Empire (Darth Vader’s cohort). The old Imperial evildoers have been replaced by the suitably cartoonish-sounding Snoke (created by the hard-working Andy Serkis and digital effects), a wormy, towering ghoul with vivid scars and an insinuating sneer. He commands the usual stormtroopers along with the impetuous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a charismatic villain who has closely fashioned himself after Vader.The story is a tangle, but its complications are mitigated by Mr. Johnson’s quick pace and the appealing performers. Like most contemporary action flicks, this one more or less plays out as a succession of fights, chases and time outs (for chatting, scheming or lonely musing) across two or more plot lines. Having joined together in “The Force Awakens,” the story’s latest dream team — Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger turned warrior; Finn (John Boyega), a First Order deserter turned resister; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a Resistance fighter pilot — now often spends time apart. Poe spins in Leia’s orbit while Rey pesters Luke, and Finn finds a winning ally (Kelly Marie Tran).An early heroic death sets the sober mood and stakes while gently re-establishing the franchise’s new commitment to diversifying the overall picture. As in “The Force Awakens,” this inclusion feels natural, a vision of the future you can recognize. About the only time it feels as if Mr. Johnson is checking “Star Wars” boxes is in some of the fights, especially during an impasse that turns into a slow-moving game of space chess. He may be checking off some of those boxes in an ode to George Lucas; whatever the case, Mr. Johnson only infrequently comes across as dutiful or as overtly brand-expanding (as with a troika of calculatingly cute tykes who unnervingly suggest this series really will go on forever).One of the truisms of the “Star Wars” series is that its battle between good and bad has always uneasily and sometimes openly mirrored the attendant struggle between good and bad filmmaking. Mr. Lucas’s 1977 foundational movie mostly transcends its flaws with slick looks, hooky effects, old-school heroics and loads of marketable material that helped turn fan love into an ecumenical cult. The second trilogy, entirely directed by Mr. Lucas, began in 1999 with “The Phantom Menace” (infamous for the minor scandal called Jar Jar Binks) and is pretty much a drag outside of some fleet light-saber duels and the arresting black-and-red patterning that distinguishes one villain.Part of what has already made the new trilogy more successful is that its directors, J.J. Abrams (“The Force Awakens”) and Mr. Johnson, are technically adept, commercially savvy “Star Wars” true believers who came of age in the post-Lucas blockbuster era. Each has had to navigate the intricacies of Mr. Lucas’s sprawling fiction while handling the deep imprint created by Darth Vader’s heavy-breathing menace, R2-D2’s amusing beeps, Mr. Ford’s insouciance, Mr. Hamill’s earnestness, and Ms. Fisher’s smarts and latter-day screwball charm. Unlike Mr. Lucas, though, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Johnson don’t feel burdened by that legacy; they’re into it, charged up, despite the pressures of such an industrial enterprise. They’re resolving their cinematic father issues with a sense of fun.Mr. Johnson can make you forget about those issues as well as the franchise’s insistent obligations; it also seems like he had a good time at work. He brings lightness to his banter, visual flair (not simply bleeding-edge special effects) to the design, and narrative savvy to Rey and Kylo Ren’s relationship. Mr. Johnson’s use of deep red is characteristic of how he turns ideas into images, most vividly with a set that looks like something Vincente Minnelli might have dreamed up for a Flash Gordon musical with Gene Kelly. When that set becomes the backdrop to a viscerally exciting fight, all the red abruptly evokes the spilled blood that this otherwise squeaky clean series insistently elides.Like “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” engages with the first “Star Wars” movie less as a fetish than as a necessary point of departure. And, like Alec Guinness’s Obi-Wan Kenobi once did, Luke comes off as a brooding monastic loner. With a hooded robe, beard and inexplicable moodiness, he has retreated to an eerily lovely, isolated island where imaginatively designed critters roam and trill. The cutest (right in time for Christmas tie-ins) are Porgs, saucer-eyed mewling creatures with plump, puffin-like bodies that are mainly on hand for easy laughs. The creature design throughout is so inventive — there are less-fuzzy whatsits on the island, too — that you wish more had been added.You feel Mr. Johnson periodically reining himself in, yet the movie cuts loose when he does, as when he embraces the galaxy’s strangeness, its non-humanoid beings as well as its magic and mystery. There’s a trippy scene in which a character floats into a resurrection, an ethereal drift that borders on the surreal. It’s a fleeting bliss-out in a series that knows how to bring the weird but has too often neglected to do so amid its blaster zapping, machinations and Oedipal stressing and storming. This is, after all, a franchise in which the most indelible character remains Yoda, the wee, far-out philosophizer with the tufted pate and syntactically distinct truth telling: “Wars not make one great.”Wars do, however, make warehouses of money as this franchise has been affirming for decades. It’s instructive how normalized its permanent war has become, with its high body count, bloodlessness and fascist chic (the black uniforms evoking the Nazi SS). Given this, it’s notable, too, that while Mr. Johnson manages the big-canvas battles well enough, he’s better with smaller-scaled fights, in which the sweat, vulnerabilities and personal costs of violence are foregrounded. With Mr. Driver — who delivers a startlingly raw performance — Mr. Johnson delivers a potent portrait of villainy that suggests evil isn’t hard-wired, an inheritance or even enigmatic. Here, it is a choice — an act of self-creation in the service of annihilation.Mr. Johnson has picked up the baton — notably the myth of a female Jedi — that was handed to Mr. Abrams when he signed on to revive the series with “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Johnson doesn’t have to make the important introductions; for the most part, the principals were in place, as was an overarching mythology that during some arid periods has seemed more sustained by fan faith than anything else. Even so, he has to convince you that these searching, burgeoning heroes and villains fit together emotionally, not simply on a Lucasfilm whiteboard, and that they have the requisite lightness and heaviness, the ineffable spirit and grandeur to reinvigorate a pop-cultural juggernaut. That he’s made a good movie in doing so isn’t icing; it’s the whole cake.","Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley","$619,117,636",USA,Rian Johnson,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",English,85,"Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers.

It focuses on Kiet Engels, a teacher introduced as she methodically sets up her classroom for another day. What separates her class from those in other Dutch villages is that her students are migrant children, many of them Syrian. So in addition to the usual curriculum of reading, writing and arithmetic, Miss Kiet gently but determinedly instructs them in the hard work of assimilation, teaching them in Dutch and encouraging them to play with Dutch children.Petra Lataster-Czisch and Peter Lataster direct the film in a fly-on-the-wall style; the young students don’t seem bothered by the camera, at least in the footage used. And as the movie progresses, a handful of precocious personalities emerge. There is Haya, who appoints herself a mentor for a new girl, Leanne, and assists her with penmanship in a way that crosses the line from helping to bossing around. (Miss Kiet sees what’s going on and intervenes.) And there is Jorj, whose younger brother, Maksim, clings to him, who sulks when he’s told he needs to take off his outdoor shoes for gym and who struggles with math.As in Nicolas Philibert’s similar French documentary “To Be and to Have” (2002), the relative absence of conflict in the interactions between a seasoned teacher and wonderful pupils grows tedious at feature length, and there is — presumably by design — relatively little meat on this documentary’s bones. We learn nothing about how the school runs or why it’s a locus for refugees. The film includes only incidental tidbits about the students’ lives outside the classroom or before their arrival in the Netherlands, although in a charged moment late in the film, Miss Kiet asks Jorj about his life in Syria, where he played football inside the house to avoid what he calls the “bang, bang” outside.“Miss Kiet’s Children” may seem soft and insubstantial in isolation, but it’s worth remembering that the movie was made before the far-right politician Geert Wilders fell short of gaining the seats his party sought in the 2017 Dutch election. Nor is the movie’s message limited to Holland.

This isn’t even the first time two guys have battled for Ms. Russo’s favor in a film written and directed by Ron Shelton.The humor is self-defeating, though, since this wheezy romantic caper — with Tommy Lee Jones and Morgan Freeman as the rival suitors — inspires little more than melancholy reminiscences of Mr. Shelton’s earlier work. Male competition, in sports and romance, has been his chief interest as a screenwriter and a filmmaker, and it has yielded some pretty good work over the years. “Bull Durham” and “White Men Can’t Jump,” most memorably, but also underrated entertainments like “Tin Cup” (in which Ms. Russo was the prize sought by Kevin Costner and Don Johnson) and “Hollywood Homicide,” which hold up better than you might expect.This one should be better than it is. There were no advance screenings for critics — never a promising sign — but I bought a ticket and sat in a Manhattan theater with a half-dozen other oddballs over the weekend and a flicker of hope in my heart. The cast includes, in addition to the three points of the romantic triangle mentioned above, such fine comic and character performers as George Wallace, Joe Pantoliano, Elizabeth Ashley and Jane Seymour. Johnny Mathis is in it, too! How dire could it be?Plenty dire, and not in a way that’s any fun to contemplate. The premise has some farcical potential. Mr. Freeman is Duke Diver, the manager of a Palm Springs retirement community with some unsavory secrets in his past. Someone is trying to kill him, but that’s the least of his troubles. The big one is the arrival of Leo McKay, a Texas big shot with a military background and a hidden agenda. He parks his pickup truck in Duke’s designated spot, wins Duke’s money in a poker game and moves in on Duke’s trio of friends with benefits (Glenne Headly, Ms. Ashley and Sheryl Lee Ralph). And then Suzie Quince (Ms. Russo) shows up to audit Duke’s books and accelerate the plot.Which sadly does not happen. In spite of the charm and discipline of the stars, the jokes misfire and the scenes creak and stumble. That it all takes place around Christmas time in the desert just makes everything sadder. “Just Getting Started,” which should skip and sprint, feels slow and interminable, as if someone were reciting the plot of a Ron Shelton movie he or she had seen once on a plane.

SCOTT,1,2017-12-22 17:44:01,Quest,Review: ‘Quest’ Is a Moving Portrait of an American Family,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/movies/quest-review-philadelphia-documentary.html,2017-12-08,2017-12-07,This documentary from Jonathan Olshefski follows a North Philadelphia family through the Obama years.,"Barack Obama is not the subject of “Quest,” Jonathan Olshefski’s new documentary, an intimate and patient portrait of a North Philadelphia family. But the film, which begins and ends with presidential elections — Mr. Obama’s in 2008 and his successor’s eight years later — is shadowed, in some ways haunted, by his presence and his temperament. At one point, he appears on television, in the wake of the massacre of school children and their teachers in Newtown, Conn. “These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods,” he says, referring to the places that have been devastated by gun violence. “These children are our children.”The simple inclusiveness of that idea and the feeling behind it — the sense that this nation, with all of its troubles, is something we’re all in together — may sound especially poignant now, and even a bit quaint. But a similar ethic of solidarity informs every moment of “Quest,” which brings us into the neighborhood and the home of Christopher and Christine’a Rainey and their teenage daughter, PJ.Christopher is also known as Quest, which is the name of the recording studio where he sits behind the mixing boards as local rappers spit their rhymes. Christine’a is Ma Quest, and the two of them, without vanity or any expectation of praise or reward, serve as mentors, confidants and semi-parental figures for the people around them. Mr. Rainey wakes up at dawn to deliver coupon circulars door to door. His wife works long hours at a shelter for survivors of domestic violence. If you lived in North Philly, you would want to know them. “Quest” offers the gift of imagining that you do, even as it honors their complicated, sometimes opaque individuality.Mr. Olshefski doesn’t pry too intrusively into their lives. He and his crew record only what the Raineys are willing to tell and show, and a story takes shape in response to events in their lives. Time flows like a current rather than advancing steadily according to the calendar or the clock. Mr. Obama’s first term passes in the blink of an eye. Before you know it, PJ and her father are talking about Mitt Romney as the 2012 election draws near.Politics is part of their world, and some of the issues that have recently galvanized public debate — health care, addiction, crime, tensions between the police and African-American citizens — figure prominently in “Quest.” Gun violence affects the Raineys with direct and traumatic force, disrupting the film’s calm, contemplative rhythm. (There’s another, blessedly benign twist later on.) The disaster that strikes them is upsetting, and the stoicism with which they keep going is at least equally moving.But the movie doesn’t hold up its subjects as symbols of suffering or as emblems of strength. The Raineys themselves make no such claim: They take pride in the normalcy of their lives. When Christine’a hears Donald J. Trump making a pitch to “the African-Americans” who he believes live in unrelieved squalor, she responds with disgust: “You have no idea how we live.”Is it too much to hope that he watches “Quest”? Its power lies in its attention to the drama of everyday existence, and Mr. Olshefski’s sharp eye for character. We track PJ’s adolescent moods, the tenderness and occasional tension that defines her parents’ relationship, and also the ups and downs of other friends and kin. Ms. Rainey’s older son, William, begins treatment for brain cancer as he’s about to become a father. A talented rapper named Price, one of Mr. Rainey’s creative collaborators and a drug user and alcoholic, squanders his promise and his friend’s good will as he fights his habit.The grace with which the family faces these hardships is the very definition of self-reliance. The hope that they might find some relief — in the form of economic security, a more responsive government, more hours in the day — is what makes “Quest” a deeply political film even as it is heartbreakingly clear about the limits of politics. Mr. Obama’s line about the common American destiny is echoed and complicated in another speech, during an anti-violence rally not far from the Raineys’ home. Noting the absence of pop stars and politicians from the scene — “Where’s Beyoncé now?” “Where’s Rihanna now?” — an activist insists that “our first role models need to be us.” I don’t think I’ve ever heard a more succinct definition of what it means to be a citizen, and I’ve rarely seen a movie about citizenship as quietly eloquent as “Quest.”",N/A,N/A,Germany,Tyron Montgomery,"Animation, Short",None,N/A,"A being made of sand wakes up in the desert.

Their mother is long gone, and their jailbird father is still locked up. When Brandon is accused of murder, he disappears, leaving Alison alone to exonerate him.Soon this gloomy family drama, directed and written by Scooter Corkle, transforms into a backwoods thriller littered with bodies and conspiracies.Under the film’s color-drained cinematography, Alison looks tired and pallid as she’s harassed and chased away by locals who despise her family. She looks ready to snap from the first scene on, yet her resolve to find her brother keeps her going. The movie mirrors Alison’s desperation through dimly lit dead-end clues and hectic chase sequences through town.Alison closely resembles Jennifer Lawrence’s character in “Winter’s Bone,” another self-sufficient young woman whose family and community turn against her. This movie is not as tense, but it gets close thanks to Ms. Agron’s resolute performance and the movie’s hostile small town setting.

A pernicious bond between the middle-aged Carl (Toby Jones, credibly crushed) and his manipulative mother, Aileen (the grand Anne Reid, passively domineering). A cinematographer (Philipp Blaubach) who pries menace from the mundane and makes even the most generic urban architecture radiate disquiet. And a despondent production design that renders Carl’s drab council flat in shades of bilious green and burial-plot brown.But the script (by Mr. Jones’s brother Rupert Jones, who also directs) is so tricky that, much like Carl, we can’t get a handle on anything. Events and timelines dissolve and reassemble like the crystals in the kaleidoscope of the title — a beloved keepsake, we gather, from an otherwise miserable childhood. A brief prologue has revealed a corpse in his bathroom, and the word “LUST” lingers on his wall calendar. Both have something to do with Abby (Sinead Matthews), a chipper date who shows up after an online encounter and is struck by his lack of possessions: Like all the best serial killers, Carl used a library computer.By the time Aileen appears, injured and in need of shelter, this painful romantic liaison may have turned tragic. Or maybe not: Committing completely to Carl’s wobbly perceptions, the filmmakers mire us in a hackneyed swamp of narrative uncertainty. Save yourself the effort of decipherment, and simply enjoy Mr. Blaubach’s baleful shots of high-rise exteriors and broody, squashed interiors.

I, Punch Line.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/movies/i-tonya-review-margot-robbie.html,2017-12-08,2017-12-06,"In this winking biopic, Margot Robbie plays the disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding.","The subject of “I, Tonya” — a winking, eager-to-please, fictionalized gloss on the disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding — gets roughed up a lot. As a child, she is degraded and smacked around by her mother, who kicks little Tonya’s chair so violently the kid flies off it. When the teenage Tonya gets involved with the man she will marry, her life as a punching bag continues. Her husband smashes her head onto a glass surface so hard that shards scatter; he bloodies her nose a few times. He also points a gun at Tonya, threatening to kill her. Despite all the beatings and blood, “I, Tonya” insists it’s a comedy.The real Tonya Harding went from fame to infamy in 1994, after she was implicated in an attack on Nancy Kerrigan, a rival. On Jan. 6, after practicing for the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, Ms. Kerrigan was attacked by a man who thwacked her leg with a collapsible police baton. (He seems to have been going for her knee.) A camera captured Ms. Kerrigan on the ground as she repeatedly wailed “Why?” Ms. Harding went on to win the championship; it was a short-lived victory. The F.B.I. was soon questioning her, her ex-husband and their dumb-and-dumber associates. By June, Ms. Harding had been barred from competing for her role in the attack.Energetically directed by Craig Gillespie, “I, Tonya” charts the hard-won rise and calamitous fall of its title character (Margot Robbie). Taking the form of a mock, mocking documentary, one that disjointedly swings between heehaw comedy and wincing agony, the movie establishes its raised-eyebrow tone with a title card stating it’s “Based on irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly,” her former husband. (The screenwriter, Steven Rogers, has said that he spoke with both.) From their separate corners, the middle-aged, long-divorced Tonya and Jeff (Sebastian Stan), provide linked, at times vividly contradictory accounts of what happened.In one location, Jeff sits facing the camera in front of a large window framed by photo-covered walls. There’s a lot more visual coding going on with Tonya, who’s plunked down at a table in a modest kitchen wearing a pale jeans jacket and cowboy boots. Lank blond hair and bangs border her face; her neck has gone puffy. Looking into the camera, she occasionally draws on a cigarette and crosses her legs, one big, down-home, country-gal ankle resting on a knee. The real eye-catchers are the dirty dishes stacked in the sink behind her. They stay put and stay dirty, which seems curiously sloppy given that Tonya, a media veteran, is here to tell her truth. If you didn’t know she had a reputation as down-and-dirty, here’s a hint.As Tonya and Jeff offer up alternating stories, her past, her abuse and her triumphs come into view. The only daughter of an unhappily married couple, the young Tonya is a daddy’s girl. Her father takes her hunting, teaching her how to shoot rabbit. Her awful mother, LaVona (Allison Janney, chilled and excellent), is the one who arranges for Tonya to take lessons with a skating coach (Julianne Nicholson). Tonya turns out to be a prodigy and is soon powering her way into the top echelon of the sport, despite the snobbery and visible discomfort of the judges who favor froufrou femininity over aggressive competition. They want gliding princesses, not grunting athletes like Tonya.The story of Tonya Harding has been told before in mainstream journalism and in scholarly accounts, documentaries and a quickie made-for-TV movie that lathered the soap. Before and after the incident, as it’s often called, she was grist for thumb-sucking takes on women, femininity, sports and social class. Before the attack, writers liked to point out that Ms. Harding played pool and drove a truck. In a sympathetic 1992 profile, Sports Illustrated described her as a “hardscrabble, dispossessed kid” who had become “an interloper in the realm of pixies and queens who’s as at home doing a brake job as she is performing an arabesque.” She was Cinderella with edge and muscles.In “I, Tonya,” she is also an unreliable narrator, just like Jeff. “There’s no such thing as truth,” Tonya announces. “Everyone has their own truth.” The film takes up this statement as its guiding narrative principle, toggling between the she-said and he-said as it hurdles toward its nadir. The older Tonya makes an assertion, and the older Jeff does likewise. The young Tonya — in flashback — says one thing, the young Jeff says something else, and every so often LaVona chimes in. Characters periodically break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and directly addressing the viewer, as if to assert ownership on the unwinding story. Listen to me, each seems to say in these moments.Ms. Robbie takes on the role with vigor and strained toothy smiles, giving an outsize performance that suits the film’s broadness and showy surfaces. (She does much of her own skating, though the trickier moves were completed with stunt doubles and digital effects.) Despite the makeup and a few tragic haircuts, Ms. Robbie remains an unpersuasive fit for the tiny Ms. Harding, who could bench press more than her weight and whose sculptured muscles freaked some out. You could write a treatise on female bodies pegged to the contempt that journalists unloaded on her, especially after the attack, when they called her “white trash” and “old Thunder Thighs.” She was 23.As “I, Tonya” skips here and there and thickens the plot, it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic, dispiriting story. No matter how hard the movie tries to coax out laughs, there’s little about Ms. Harding, her circumstances or her choices that skews as funny. She was poor, grew up in trailers, had a temper, liked loud colors, dropped out of school, traded in one abuser for another and maintained some stupid acquaintances — a clown posse the filmmakers lavish too much time on. She might have played a role in the attack on Ms. Kerrigan, but in many ways Ms. Harding had already been found guilty for just being who she was. The same feels true here.“I, Tonya” asserts that the truth is elusive. Yet some facts are known. Ms. Harding — as was widely reported — took out restraining orders against Mr. Gillooly, telling the police that he had hit her and she was afraid of him. Back then, her abuse was often played down; here, it is countered by scenes in which the tough Tonya fights back, at times with a comedic spin, as if to suggest that she can give as good as she gets. That makes this film and the brutality more breezily watchable, I suppose. Still, it’s instructive that at one point Tonya lectures the audience on its complicity in how she was treated. It’s an impressively disingenuous wag of the finger from a film that has encouraged our laughter right from the start.","Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson","$28,950,158",USA,Craig Gillespie,"Biography, Comedy, Drama",English,77,"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes.",R,NEON,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",19 Jan 2018,120 min,"I, Tonya",Steven Rogers,2017,7.5,"112,353","[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '90%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '77/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]","i, tonya","I, Tonya",Neon,155000.0,-38.0,49.0,3163.0,2351336.0,24.0,17531.0

Early on in  “Bill Frisell: A Portrait,” Mr. Frisell, a quiet, diffident man, tells an off-camera interviewer that when he gets up in the morning, he picks up a guitar, starts playing “and then …” he drifts off. The suggestion is that he never stops.Directed by Emma Franz, this project has clearly been in the works for a long time. Three of its interviewees, all music greats, have died in recent years: the jazz guitarist Jim Hall, also a teacher of Mr. Frisell’s; the remarkable drummer Paul Motian, with whom Mr. Frisell played in a groundbreaking jazz trio with Joe Lovano; and the wonderful, albeit widely misunderstood, guitarist John Abercrombie, who provides an interesting technical analysis of Mr. Frisell’s style and tone, among the most distinctive and recognizable in contemporary music.I am a fervent fan of Mr. Frisell’s. I’ve been following his work since the mid-1980s; I’ve seen him perform live twice this year, and might try to catch one of his shows this weekend at Jazz Standard.Nevertheless, there are several points in this movie — which I’m still recommending — that I found, if not boring, a little dry. In a sense, Mr. Frisell, 66, is an entirely atypical contemporary musician. As the impresario and record producer Hal Willner notes early in the documentary, despite Mr. Frisell’s having performed or recorded with literally hundreds of other top-flight players and troubadours, “there’s no one who has a bad word to say about him.” Being a “no drama” person is lovely, and it’s particularly salutary that Mr. Frisell upends the myth that the great artist needs to be full of anger, or to behave badly, to be inspired.These qualities, however, don’t always make entirely compelling cinema. A cab ride through London with Mr. Frisell’s former teacher, the composer and conductor Michael Gibbs, is frankly a little drowsy. Once the duo, who are working on a collaborative concert, reach their destination, a radio station, they are directed to a studio called “the Barbarella Room.”On the way there, Mr. Frisell recalls what he remembers as “the only illegal thing” he has ever done: as a 15-year-old, gaining entry to a theatrical screening of “Barbarella,” the very tame, sex-in-outer-space ’60s film starring Jane Fonda, when the movie was restricted to viewers over 16. Which is funny.But the movie is at its liveliest when it depicts Mr. Frisell making his distinctive sound with a variety of colleagues. And, fortunately, Ms. Franz includes a lot of such footage.","Joey Baron, Brian Camelio, Nels Cline, Jack DeJohnette",N/A,Australia,Emma Franz,Documentary,English,71,"The normally private Seattle native and Grammy-winning guitarist opens up for an exploration of his life, work, and musical process.",N/A,Films Transit International,"[{'Value': '7.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",06 Dec 2017,118 min,Bill Frisell: A Portrait,Emma Franz,2017,7.2,36,"[{'Value': '7.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '88%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '71/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",bill frisell: a portrait,,,,,,,,,

This year, a painting of his sold for $110.5 million. Haring died in 1990 of AIDS; his works regularly sell in the low millions. As for Mr. Hambleton, who for years had cancer that he declined to treat, he died recently, in a cheap residence in Chinatown. According to “Shadowman,” a fascinating, harrowing film about his life, he was still painting until he died.One interviewee posits that death turned out to be a good career move for Basquiat and Haring. Mr. Hambleton, by dint of staying alive, never sold at extravagant prices.The movie, directed by Oren Jacoby, begins with black-and-white, night-shot video of Mr. Hambleton stalking the Lower East Side, paint can and brush in hand, and making instant silhouettes on building walls. These shadow paintings were different from graffiti, he insisted. They created a sensation, and Mr. Hambleton, who had begun in Vancouver, British Columbia, doing sidewalk “murder paintings” in which chalk outlines of bodies were spattered with blood-red paint, got caught up in the underground arts scene’s attendant vices.But he never stopped painting, even making works with his own blood on paper during a heroin-driven period when he was living in a single room with two women. Friends and patrons, most of them interviewed here, interceded. Mr. Hambleton got skin cancer and had scoliosis.In later years, we see him scurrying through his studio’s corridors, practically hunchbacked, a Band-Aid seeming to hold his nose to his face.

33,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-12-30 17:44:01,The Disaster Artist,"Review: In ‘The Disaster Artist,’ How to Fail at Moviemaking",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/movies/the-disaster-artist-review-ames-franco-tommy-wiseau.html,2017-12-08,2017-11-30,"James Franco directs and stars in this fictionalized look at the making of “The Room,” which fans call the worst movie ever made.","An ode to bad taste and dubious intentions, the ha-ha comedy “The Disaster Artist” involves one of the favorite topics of the movies: itself. It’s another story of crushed Hollywood dreams, one that unfolds through the eyes of Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), an aspiring actor who hitched himself to a phenomenon when he met Tommy Wiseau (James Franco, Dave’s brother). A would-be auteur, the real Mr. Wiseau became a minor cult figure after he released a 2003 specialty item, “The Room,” that some anointed the worst movie ever made. In time, its notoriety started to pay off; in 2013, Mr. Sestero wrote a tell-all book.Based on that tell-all (which Mr. Sestero wrote with Tom Bissell), “The Disaster Artist” recounts both the making of a friendship and the absurdly inept movie it produced. Greg meets Tommy in acting class, where they’re both bombing out. Greg comes off as simply incompetent as he flatly fumbles through a scene from “Waiting for Godot,” one of the movie’s first jokey meta-moments. (“Let us do something, while we have the chance!,” Vladimir exclaims in “Godot,” much as Tommy soon urges Greg.) Tommy, by vivid contrast, captivates the agape class — particularly the inhibited Greg — by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed.An odd, inexplicable friendship begins, and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy’s apartment, the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business, though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades, as it does, amid the sunshine and smiles, and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender, Amber (Alison Brie). At last, inspired by Greg, Tommy — who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty — decides to direct and star in his own movie, with Greg as backup. It’s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination.James Franco, who also directed “The Disaster Artist,” swoops through the movie like a star, one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics, Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too, having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau’s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing, Mr. Franco’s performance retains an interior lightness, a playfulness, including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn’t making fun of his character, at least not entirely; rather, he’s put distance into the mix, as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man, a construction.The making of “The Room” gives “The Disaster Artist” its point and much of its broad comedy. Filmmakers love making movies about movies, and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar “Interior. Leather Bar.,” an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of “Cruising.”) Mr. Franco recreates the production of “The Room” — and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness — with an assured, energetic touch, some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen, who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy’s put-upon script supervisor.Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, “The Disaster Artist” is a straighter, more obviously commercial-minded project than some of the other movies that Mr. Franco has directed. It’s a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge. In “The Room,” Mr. Wiseau comes across as somewhat menacing, with an underlying intensity that can’t be entirely laughed away. (That’s part of what makes the unwatchable almost watchable.) Mr. Franco’s performance keeps you hooked, in large degree because of its entertaining visual spectacle. Tommy’s wardrobe, for one, suggests a commitment to the 1980s and a familiarity with the defunct catalog International Male, a source for padded briefs and Jack Sparrow frippery.Yet if Mr. Wiseau is a bona fide eccentric, he proves to be not an especially interesting one in this incarnation. The filmmakers try to complicate Tommy, including with some self-referential layering that never meaningfully develops. At one point early on, Greg and Tommy visit the site where James Dean died, a pilgrimage that at once nods to Mr. Franco’s breakthrough role as Dean and telegraphs one of the more ludicrous scenes in “The Room.” Dean becomes Greg and Tommy’s inspiration, a success story that they invoke while struggling to make it. But there’s no sense that either remotely grasps Dean’s art, which might have made their failure and “The Disaster Artist” more resonant.Mr. Wiseau has made the most of his 15 minutes, which have already been generously extended by “The Disaster Artist.” His website for “The Room” suggests that he’s a busy man. It lists where and how you can see the film, sometimes with him in attendance. In the synergistic spirit of Disney (but with lavish misspellings), the website also features a line of tie-in products like “Room”-themed watches, backpacks, jackets and men’s briefs emblazoned with Mr. Wiseau’s name on the waistband. It’s funny and somewhat depressing, which also pretty much sums up the “The Room,” one of those cultish attractions that is so terrible it makes you wonder if the laugh finally is on us.","Dave Franco, James Franco, Seth Rogen, Ari Graynor",N/A,USA,James Franco,"Biography, Comedy, Drama",English,76,"When Greg Sestero, an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true.",R,A24,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",08 Dec 2017,104 min,The Disaster Artist,"Scott Neustadter (screenplay by), Michael H.

An obsessive peeper who enjoyed decades of onanistic pleasure at his oblivious guests’ expense, Mr. Foos shared his prurient interests and diaries with Mr. Talese, who documented them for The New Yorker in 2016. A poorly reviewed book followed, only to be briefly disavowed by Mr. Talese after The Washington Post unearthed serious discrepancies in Mr. Foos’s recollections.Filled with unasked questions and unverified assertions, “Voyeur” is a sad, strange tale of two men whose similarities of taste and temperament — including extreme ego, unbridled nosiness and a penchant for the lurid — are its real subject. Chronicling the literary debacle and the decades-long relationship that preceded it, the directors Myles Kane and Josh Koury dance from the memorabilia-crammed basement in Mr. Talese’s Manhattan brownstone to the cluttered living-room in a Denver suburb where Mr. Foos holds court.Choosing not to delve too deeply into the mind of either man — or to question Mr. Talese’s journalistic ethics and less-than-scrupulous fact-checking — the directors are content to mostly watch as each vies for control of the movie, and his legacy. It’s an entertainingly desperate joust, playing out beneath defiantly unattractive lighting.“I’m the guy!” Mr. Foos rails, infuriated when media attention over the book focuses on Mr. Talese. And when one of the filmmakers tentatively asks Mr. Foos to explain an inaccuracy in his story, Mr. Talese vociferously objects, deriding the directors as mere “cameramen” and unfit to act as journalists. The humor of these outbursts is not lost on the directors, who add little jabs of their own with repeated shots of Mr. Foos and his wife, Anita, peeking through their window shades in nervous agitation.The second wife to collude with her husband’s clandestine adventures (the first, Donna, even brought him the occasional snack), Ms. Foos remains a placid enigma. Now, her primary purpose seems to be soothing and cajoling the husband who once viewed himself as a superior being. In one especially memorable moment, he threatens a meltdown over book reviews that he feels present him as “nothing but a creep.”“Well,” his wife says, smiling, “you are.”","Edward Akrout, Gerald Foos, Sacha Storto, Gay Talese",N/A,USA,"Myles Kane, Josh Koury",Documentary,English,59,"Journalism icon Gay Talese reports on Gerald Foos, the owner of a Colorado motel, who allegedly secretly watched his guests with the aid of specially designed ceiling vents, peering down from an ""observation platform"" he built in the motel's attic.",TV-MA,Netflix,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Dec 2017,96 min,Voyeur,N/A,2017,6.2,"2,578","[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '81%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '59/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",voyeur,,,,,,,,,

It tells the story of a desperately, unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter, whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants, as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife, Soon-Yi, the daughter of his longtime ex, Mia Farrow. I tend to think it’s a bad idea to put a movie on the couch, but what if it climbs on the couch and then starts winking?“Wonder Wheel” returns Mr. Allen to Coney Island, the childhood home of his alter ego Alvy Singer, the narrator of “Annie Hall” who claims to have grown up under the amusement park’s roller coaster. (“I have some trouble between fantasy and reality,” Alvy says.) In “Wonder Wheel,” the sad wife, Ginny (Kate Winslet), lives in an apartment that looks directly onto the park’s looming Ferris wheel. The attraction obscures her view of the ocean, literalizing already narrow horizons, and casts deep, expressionistic blue and red light on the apartment’s dilapidated interior and its equally worn inhabitants.Ginny isn’t all used up, despite the insistently unflattering way she is often presented. She winces and frowns a lot, and the camera conspires with the lighting and makeup to catch every twitch of distress, and the sweaty, oily sheen she never seems able to blot away. It’s no surprise that she’s worried. She works in a clam house on the boardwalk, scrambling for hoi polloi, while back at home she has to juggle her loud, loutish husband, Humpty (Jim Belushi), and her son, Richie (Jack Gore). Like the young Alvy in “Annie Hall,” Richie is a redhead. But while Alvy is depressed about the universe, Richie seems largely troubled by his home life, specifically his demonstrably miserable mother.So, when Mickey (Justin Timberlake, too modern a presence), a lifeguard and self-described romantic, gives Ginny the once over, she gratefully falls into his arms. “Wonder Wheel” more or less becomes Ginny’s story, but she doesn’t get to own it. The movie is narrated by Mickey, who pops in and out and looks directly into the camera. He has literary ambitions, as he likes to remind us, as well as a pad in Greenwich Village. For a while, Mickey offers Ginny a respite from her everyday grind, at least until the arrival of Carolina (a fine Juno Temple), Humpty’s daughter from an earlier marriage. She’s on the run from her gangster husband. “I know where all the bodies are buried,” Carolina says.Somewhat of a cultural magpie, Mr. Allen has often folded bits and pieces — and at times entire conceits — from other work into his movies. Mickey mentions Eugene O’Neill, a reference that suggests we’re meant to see something of that playwright in Ginny and Humpty at their most raw and boozily fraught. Mr. Allen’s often blunt, overwrought dialogue, however, also alternately brings to mind Budd Schulberg (“I coulda been a contender”) and imitation Clifford Odets. In some scenes, you almost expect Mr. Belushi, who’s playing his heart out, to start bellowing about someone named Lefty. Much like its gaudy title attraction, “Wonder Wheel” keeps on turning, even while going nowhere.This is Mr. Allen’s second movie with the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who seems to have enjoyed taking the color wheel and camera out for a spin. He gives the story visual flow, even when the characters are in claustrophobic lockdown. And Mr. Storaro keeps your pupils dancing with the light and dark hues. Some of the establishing shots of Coney Island recall the softer side of Technicolor, whereas the violently saturated scenes suggest the vibrancy of the Blue Rider palette. The more extreme colors — including an unlovely orange light that floods Ginny — pushes the whole thing into expressionism even as the movie fluctuates between kitchen-sink realism and hothouse melodrama.Mr. Allen certainly keeps you busy with all these colors, tones, influences, complications, stereotypes and histrionics, but to little end. As has always been the case with his movies, the actors seem to have delivered the performances they came to the set with, so the strong — in this case, the invaluable Ms. Winslet — are strong while the rest of the cast members do what they can with varying degrees of success. Ginny, who yearns for something better than clam houses and brutality — and who is mercilessly punished for her yearning — could easily have become a monstrous, one-note cliché. But Ms. Winslet fills this shabby character with feverish life. She conveys far more with a single, quietly stunned look than any of Mr. Allen’s speeches or Mr. Storaro’s color changes.At one point, after Ginny has turned into Blanche DuBois, she announces, “When it comes to love we often turn out to be our own worst enemy.” And not for the first time you wonder what Mr. Allen, who has long blurred fact and fiction, thinks he’s doing here. He couldn’t have anticipated that his name would be in the news because of the allegations of sexual abuse upending the entertainment industry. Yet how could we not think of him? In 1993, he was accused of molesting his daughter, Dylan Farrow. He maintained his innocence and was never prosecuted, yet the allegations as well as discomfort about his marriage to Soon-Yi have hovered over him like a malignant cloud. Critics have often uneasily ignored his history, but he himself seems perversely intent on invoking it.","Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple, Robert C.

Hiding out, he takes a job alongside a cousin, a farmworker named Hassan (Mahmoud El Bezawi). Hassan’s boss, Mourad (Zaki Faten), a respected landowner, seems decent enough at first: He allows Ali to stay. But he also counts on total subservience.Complicating the claustrophobic arrangement is the fact that Hassan has married Ali’s old flame, Fatma (Nahed El Sebai). She still longs for Ali, a strapping, handsome contrast to her kind but ineffectual husband, while the oblivious Hassan tries to arrange a marriage for his cousin.What follows combines a bit of James M. Cain and a bit of “Macbeth” — and more than a bit of topicality, since the events in the film, though they unfold away from Cairo, overlap with the Tahrir Square demonstrations of 2011.

While her mother, Sandy (Jennifer Garner), struggles to adjust to their new neighbors’ plastic smiles, Medina’s father, Phil (Justin Kirk), decides to moves on, leaving Medina and her twin brother, Jim (the newcomer Cody Fern), in their mother’s increasingly unstable care.Directed by the brothers Brendan and Emmett Malloy, “The Tribes of Palos Verdes” portrays the cultish fixations that can arise within volatile families. As the mother forces the weight of her sadness onto her son, the father pushes his daughter to be his advocate with his estranged wife, and the son projects his anxiety onto his sister. As Medina’s world churns, she takes up surfing, which gives her the only head cool enough to narrate this tale of family dysfunction.It is the film’s great fortune that the Masons are portrayed by an exceptional team of actors, starting with Ms. Monroe, who is the calm eye at the center of the storm. The bellows of this tempest come from Ms. Garner, who ably depicts the demanding neediness of the vulnerable matriarch. Yet the Malloys’ filmmaking never rises to the level of the actors’ nuanced performances. The actors are energized, but the camera enervates. The colors have been bled from the California sunshine, and the camera alternates wanly between shaky close-ups and indifferent establishing shots.

It’s the story of a police officer, Rosa (Liliana Trujillo), who’s struggling with alcoholism and a gambling addiction while living with her daughter and grandson in Lima, Peru. Things are clearly not going well. Rosa falls into drunken stupors almost daily while watching late-night TV. Those hazy moments are among the few times she laughs. One night, after a fight with Rosa, her daughter Sheyla leaves her baby in her mother’s obviously unreliable care.The movie, messily constructed, seems more fascinated with the tragedy of these two women’s parallel struggles than it does with the characters themselves. They become walking metaphors in search of a story arc. Then there’s a deus ex machina that throws into question everything we’ve seen in the movie up to that point. It’s a radically upbeat note that’s too contrived in an otherwise desolate situation.Although “Rosa Chumbe” is Peru’s foreign language film entry for the Oscars this year, the movie doesn’t feel like it warrants that distinction. The women’s missteps seem to come straight out of a cautionary tale. And the movie’s dismal outlook even extends to the dimly-lit cinematography. It doesn’t need a miracle to see the light. It needs a full pardon.","Liliana Trujillo, Cindy Díaz, Franco Diaz, Alejandro Romero Caceres",N/A,Peru,Jonatan Relayze,Drama,Spanish,N/A,"Rosa is a mature police officer with both a gambling and a drinking problem.

Her bandmate Malik (John David Washington) proves a faithless boyfriend, and Coco doesn’t split from the group, but does distance herself from it. “You want to rap? That’s fine with me,” Coco’s no-nonsense mother advises. “But from now on you’re going to have to do it between classes.”At the small college where Coco studies accounting, she is led by her friend Julie (Hana Mae Lee) to a poetry class headed by the imperious, glamorous Professor Dixon (Jill Scott) and her handsome, young British-accented teaching assistant Derek (Lucien Laviscount). Both insist to Coco that rap and poetry are different things. She defiantly sets to prove them wrong, only to discover that in a way they’re right.The script by Nicole Jefferson Asher toggles between sharp observations about wordcraft and some “Dynasty”- or Tyler Perry-level soap operatics. RZA’s direction lacks visual personality, but he keeps the narrative moving and elicits strong performances from his cast. The rap battle and poetry slams take place in settings that are brightly lit and — a few tetchy spats between rivals romantic and artistic notwithstanding — relaxed. The dangerous, poverty- and drug-plagued Staten Island from which RZA’s own music sprang feels very far away. But the director’s comfortable approach to his material and its milieu seems unforced, and yields a frequently enjoyable movie.","John David Washington, Common, Hana Mae Lee, Lorraine Toussaint",N/A,USA,RZA,"Drama, Musical",English,54,"When struggling rapper Coco (Azealia Banks) enrolls in a poetry class, she thinks her rhymes will impress her teacher, Professor Dixon (Jill Scott).

Even by the end, it hasn’t made a good case for its existence. Still, Hope Litoff’s documentary becomes more voyeuristically gripping as it progresses.Ms. Litoff, a film editor, begins by investigating the storage space filled with the belongings of her sister, Ruth, an artist who committed suicide in 2008. Hope wants to find something illuminating, though the prospect that Ruth, who had a long history of mental illness, left some sort of Rosebud is a dubious proposition.Still, “32 Pills” makes clear how Ruth’s personality, coupled with her seemingly endless photographs, writings and drawings, created the temptation. The film explores the notion that the sisters were troubled in different ways. And as the excavation continues, predictably — maybe even subconsciously — Hope’s own health issues resurface.A recovered alcoholic, Hope shoots chilling video-diary footage of her first drink in 16 years. She pops two pills from a table covered with her sister’s leftover prescription medication bottles. “There’s something about the fact that they’re Ruth’s pills that make them feel more special to me,” she says. Her producer, Beth Levison, who is present, expresses alarm about becoming an enabler.The exchange sums up what’s queasily fascinating about “32 Pills.” Without Hope’s relapse, the movie would be too personal: something for family, friends and a therapist.

Ms. Di Giusto takes considerable liberties with the facts of Fuller’s life, giving her an entirely fictional male patron whose decadent ether addiction is out of a bad “Dorian Gray” parody. (It’s not much of a role, and Gaspard Ulliel, who was very good in 2014’s “Saint Laurent,” makes very little of it.) In Ms. Di Giusto’s vision, Fuller is outshined by Isadora Duncan, portrayed by Lily-Rose Depp as a shallow arriviste. Ms. Depp’s flat line readings are, in this respect, appropriate.Rather than depicting the milieu in which Fuller thrived, Ms. Di Giusto mainly confines the action to a villa where Fuller endures sickness and a series of self-fulfilling romantic humiliations. She then watches as Duncan goes on to eclipse her. In commemorating the work of a female artist by largely refracting it through an imagined professional rivalry with another female artist, “The Dancer” seems genuinely hostile to its subject, whose real-life accomplishments deserve better.","Soko, Gaspard Ulliel, Mélanie Thierry, Lily-Rose Depp",N/A,"France, Belgium, Czech Republic",Stéphanie Di Giusto,"Biography, Drama, History","French, English",44,Loïe Fuller was the toast of the Folies Bergères at the turn of the 20th century and an inspiration for Toulouse-Lautrec and the Lumière Brothers.

Stopping him raises thorny questions involving the First and Second Amendments, and introduces broad arguments over liberty and innovation.Interviews with Mr. Wilson show him to be both astute and confounding, sometimes sounding like a cautious bookworm, other times like an undergrad drunk on Ayn Rand novels; he disdains corporate influence in politics, yet admires the alt-right movement.Mr. Wilson’s interests don’t end with guns.

Like Mr. Wilson, Mr. Taaki has brazen ideas about revolution.Those ideas have been around for centuries. But technologies can now turn them into something frightening. Though it would have been valuable to see Mr. Wilson and Mr. Taaki challenged on their opinions, Adam Bhala Lough, the director, allows the men to make uncontested cases for their extremist and sometimes militant stances. Interviews with Julian Assange and mentions of George Orwell are sprinkled throughout, sowing a sense of paranoia.It’s possible to fully, and vehemently, disagree with Mr. Wilson and Mr. Taaki yet still see their points.

As a British intelligence officer during World War II, Mr. Lewis was stationed in Naples after the Allied Forces’ invasion of nearby Salerno in September 1943. An able translator, he helped the military communicate with the civilian population.On the evidence of the film, he also served as a remarkable chronicler of life in the occupied city. His plain-spoken yet poetic sentences (“Now the statues are disappearing from the public squares, and one cemetery has lost most of its tombstones”) are read in voice-over by Benedict Cumberbatch, and the fluid editing skillfully illustrates his words with disparate material — a mix that includes archival footage and movies like Roberto Rossellini’s “Paisan,” Mike Nichols’s “Catch-22” and Liliana Cavani’s “The Skin.”This aesthetic choice — along with useless snippets of an actor, not clearly identified as such, playing Mr. Lewis as an old man returning to the city — doesn’t always seem fitting. You may at times wonder if Mr. Lewis, who died in 2003, would have chosen some of these clips. But the selection does lend an effective visual dimension to Mr. Lewis’s tales of wartime strife in the city. We hear of a lack of food and clean water; how Neapolitans resorted to prostitution and to buying goods on the black market; and how disease ran rampant through the city, taking it back to an almost medieval state. Mr. Lewis remembers the devastation of delayed-action explosive devices left by the Germans and the “slag heap” from the eruption of Vesuvius, just southeast of Naples, in March 1944.It’s also a story of camaraderie; among Mr. Lewis’s Neapolitan friends was a man who made money posing as a fancy uncle from Rome at funerals. But colorful details like that don’t change the sense that “Naples ’44” is essentially an abridged version of a much more detailed work. It seems less a full-fledged movie than a trailer for a book.","Benedict Cumberbatch, Adriano Giannini, Alan Arkin, Ernest Borgnine",N/A,Italy,Francesco Patierno,"Documentary, War","Italian, English",51,A British Intelligence Officer in Naples at the end of World War II: Norman Lewis's acknowledged masterpiece about a war-torn city and its unforgettable humanity.,N/A,N/A,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Nov 2017,80 min,Naples '44,"Norman Lewis (novel), Francesco Patierno (screenplay by)",2016,6.5,94,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '51/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",naples '44,,,,,,,,,

Now Ms. Zanuck has made, in her second feature film as director, a documentary on Mr. Clapton’s life that takes into consideration the many turning points in the classic rock legend’s career.As the title, “Eric Clapton: A Life in 12 Bars,” implies, it begins with the blues. In narration, Mr. Clapton talks of being practically mesmerized by music by African-American musicians he heard on the radio as a child. Obsessed, he picked up a guitar and started imitating the players he loved, including B.B. King and Little Walter, whose harmonica sounds he wanted to adapt to guitar. Music helped him cope with, or at least mentally escape, a confusing home life, one in which he initially believed his mother was an older sister.Ms. Zanuck takes an unusual approach to the music documentary. She has no talking-head interviews; the visual component is entirely composed of archival footage, of either the still or moving-picture variety. Interviewees are tagged with onscreen titles. (Roger Waters is erroneously presented as the guitarist for Pink Floyd; he was its bass player.)The first half of the movie is largely a 1960s “and then I wrote/played” story that is more interested in Mr. Clapton’s romantic obsession with Pattie Boyd, the then-wife of his then-best-friend George Harrison, than with Mr. Clapton’s seemingly constitutional inability to stick with one band for any length of time — although the two things may not be entirely unrelated, in terms of temperament at least. The pursuit of Ms. Boyd did yield one of the most notable classic rock albums ever, “Layla,” and its making is given a considered treatment here. But Mr. Clapton’s work with the American roots rockers Delaney & Bonnie, and his first solo album, both stage-setters for “Layla,” are completely ignored.The second half of the film, though, shows exemplary frankness in revealing how drugs and alcohol brought out the very worst in Mr. Clapton in the 1970s. His reprehensible racist remarks, his abuse of friends and band mates, and more, is laid out in practically unsparing detail.“I was becoming chauvinistic and fascist, too,” he admits of his behavior. At the end of that tunnel was a sobriety that was, some might say, cruelly tested by the death of Conor. As a musical biography, this comes up short; it plays substantially better as a story of recovery and recovered integrity.","Eric Clapton, Pattie Boyd, George Harrison, Charlotte Martin",N/A,UK,Lili Fini Zanuck,Documentary,English,62,"A look at the life and work of guitarist Eric Clapton, told by those who have known him best, including BB King, Jimi Hendrix, and George Harrison.",TV-MA,Showtime Documentary Films,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",24 Nov 2017,135 min,Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars,"Stephen 'Scooter' Weintraub, Larry Yelen",2017,7,753,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '69%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '62/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",eric clapton: life in 12 bars,,,,,,,,,

His new movie looks back fondly at its people and its leader.,"The cameraman in “Cuba and the Cameraman” is the indefatigable documentary filmmaker Jon Alpert, the director of the movie. Which begins inside a car, in Havana in 2016, as the death of Fidel Castro is announced on state radio. The streets are nearly empty and have a haunted quality. Havana has seen a lot of change, but in some ways it still earns its reputation for being frozen in time.Mr. Alpert’s movie is a personal examination of the ways Cuba changed and did not change over the course of the 45 years he has been visiting and filming there, shooting over 1,000 hours of footage in the country and even accompanying Castro on one memorable trip to the United States.The director’s story begins with cofounding the Downtown Community Television Center, where he used scrappy video equipment to expose sweatshops and chronicle labor struggles in New York. His interest in Cuba grew out of his activism: “We heard that Fidel Castro was implementing the social programs that we were fighting for here in New York,” Mr. Alpert states plainly.He doesn’t explain how he, an American, was able to enter Cuba for his first visits, when he toured schools and hospitals set up by what he calls “the revolution.” Later on, he was on the plane with Castro when he flew to New York to address the United Nations in 1979. In these and other scenes, Castro demonstrates his much bruited charisma, playing to Mr. Alpert’s camera in a slyly ingratiating way.Mr. Alpert’s friendliness toward Castro and many of his policies will no doubt infuriate some viewers (the authoritarian regime’s human rights abuses are not addressed). But even those frustrated by Mr. Alpert’s politics will appreciate the ordinary Cuban lives he captured on his visits.Among them is a little girl who Mr. Alpert tracks down decades after first photographing her, discovering a single mother of two trying to leave the island. Once she does, Mr. Alpert follows the children she left behind. There’s also Luis, an amiable slum resident who Mr. Alpert misses on one visit because he’s doing prison time for working the black market — an activity he cheerfully returns to on his release. Most memorable are Angel, Gregorio and Cristobal, three farming brothers who are able to beat Mr. Alpert at arm wrestling well into old age.In part because of its political blind spots, “Cuba and the Cameraman” is captivating. (Whatever you think of Mr. Alpert’s perspective, it’s interesting.)

Identified by their first names, they tell their stories to the camera: We hear how they came to Turin, how they became homeless, what they dream of and how they feel about “al di qua” — a phrase translated in the subtitles as “life/here” that, in this context, seems understood more simply as “life as they see it.”In between interviews, “Al Di Qua,” written and directed by Corrado Franco, offers a narrative line of sorts, as the cast members gather at a hospital to pay tribute to Rodolfo, a dead comrade. In the strangest of many strange aesthetic decisions, the voices have been slowed down to give the dialogue a baritone sound, as if a combination of (mostly) black-and-white shooting, a fragmented structure, sporadic slow motion, quotations from Rainer Maria Rilke, Godardian title cards and absurdly gratuitous overlays of Bach weren’t portentous enough.The film’s official materials cite Vittorio De Sica and Pier Paolo Pasolini as inspirations. “Al Di Qua” has other antecedents, too, from Lionel Rogosin’s “On the Bowery” (1957) to the Fontainhas films of Pedro Costa — all movies about poverty that combine fiction and documentary elements.But Mr. Rogosin was a gifted filmmaker, as is Mr. Costa. “Al Di Qua” is so showy in its stylistic choices and glacial in its pace — it’s tempting to applaud every time the camera finally rounds a corner — that it comes across as amateurish. The film seems pitched at an audience that has never heard of homelessness: Every shot is composed to evoke acknowledgment of the subjects’ dignity, even while individual personalities are subsumed into the blur of Mr. Franco’s operatic ambitions. However worthy or political its intent, “Al Di Qua” is too overwrought to seem anything but trivializing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His best-known titles, “I Am Love” and “A Bigger Splash,” feature beautiful people with impeccable taste experiencing haute-bourgeois life intensely. Passion and drama upend those lives, but what’s most striking about these movies is their extraordinary palpable quality. In Mr. Guadagnino’s work, passion and drama are expressed in words, deeds and surging music but also in the vibrant, visceral textures that envelop his characters — the cool marble, succulent fruit, shadow and light, sheens of sweat. These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch, inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies.Mr. Guadagnino’s latest, “Call Me by Your Name,” is another ravishment of the senses, though this time there’s a strong narrative tethering all the churning feelings and sensuous surfaces. Like the 2007 novel by André Aciman on which it’s based, the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian, and Oliver (Armie Hammer), an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father, a professor of Greco-Roman culture, invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it’s Oliver who moves in.Elio and Oliver’s affair begins slowly with each circling the other at a distance, conveying the kind of nonchalance that’s a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio’s furtive, ducking glances, by contrast, tend to linger, hovering in the air like questions. He’s increasingly curious about this new guest, but soon inexplicably (to Elio, at least) irked by him as well, leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver’s standard signoff (“later”). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook, chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver, it’s as if he were writing an apologetic love letter.Mr. Guadagnino is very good at catching the indolent drift of long summer days, with their sleepiness and bared limbs. Everyone seems to move in slow motion at the villa, except perhaps the family’s hard-working maid. This languor fits the tempo of Elio and Oliver’s relationship, which evolves over meals, drowsy idylls, a little work and a spontaneous piano recital that becomes an overture to seduction. A gifted musician, Elio easily moves from piano to guitar (much as his family shifts from speaking Italian to French to English), talent that makes him seem at one with the villa’s miles of bookshelves, its velvet sofas, scattered Oriental rugs and tastefully arranged antiques.It’s an alluring milieu — charming, civilized and perfectly, if a shade too flawlessly, arranged. Here, even a busy breakfast table and the fruit on a tree can seem art directed. Mr. Guadagnino almost can’t help making everything look intoxicating, yet he also makes you believe in this family’s reality. The grand piano isn’t for show and neither are the books or the open affection and respect with which Elio and his parents treat one another. (The movie reminds you how rarely characters read for pleasure, much less listen to classical music.) “Call Me by Your Name” is set in 1983, so no one is staring into a smartphone. And the time frame means that AIDS doesn’t figure in the story, though there’s a suggestion that the closet does.The story primarily unfolds through Elio’s point of view. The restless camera tags alongside him, showing you what he sees, his erotic reveries and yearning. And it’s Elio who initiates the affair, at least overtly, though Oliver later admits to playing his part in what the story frames as a mutual seduction. Mr. Guadagnino avoids directly engaging the difference in Elio and Oliver’s ages, which might have forced him to explore the underside of his sumptuous surfaces to greater, messier effect. Instead, Mr. Guadagnino leans on beauty, as when Elio’s father poetically speaks to an increasingly agitated Oliver about the “ageless ambiguity” of some male statues (“as if they’re daring you to desire them”).Written by James Ivory (the director of films like “Maurice”), “Call Me by Your Name” progresses through evasions and encounters, with Elio advancing, Oliver receding and their circling narrowing. The two don’t (can’t, won’t) always say what they mean. So Mr. Guadagnino speaks for them by eroticizing their world, making desire visible in the luxuriousness of the setting, in the green enveloping the villa, the gushing waters of a pool and the graceful lines of male statues. When Oliver hungrily eats a soft-boiled egg, cracking the shell and causing the yolk to messily spurt, Mr. Guadagnino’s lyricism slides into comedy; it’s hard to know just how self-mocking the moment is meant to be.Even so, the lyricism seduces as does fragile, ecstatic Elio. “Call Me by Your Name” is less a coming-of-age story, a tale of innocence and loss, than one about coming into sensibility. In that way, it is about the creation of a new man who, the story suggests, is liberated by pleasure that doesn’t necessarily establish sexual identity. It’s important that Elio and Oliver have relationships with women, though for seemingly different reasons: the overheated Elio sleeps with a girlfriend (Esther Garrel), while Oliver carries on a more performative affair with a local (Victoire Du Bois). The women are not treated with much kindness, but these affairs further complicate the movie’s vision of pleasure’s fluidity.There are moments when Mr. Guadagnino’s visual choices seem unintentionally in competition with the quieter, intricate emotions that his actors put across so movingly. He can be discreet to the point of coyness (bodies sweat but don’t necessarily grunt), but it is finally the insistent delicacy and depth of emotion that makes these characters so heart-skippingly tender. The charismatic Mr. Chalamet, Mr. Hammer and Mr. Stuhlbarg — whose brilliant delivery of a tricky speech pierces the heart and, crucially, the movie’s lustrous patina — transform beauty into feeling. In one alive, vulnerable and life-altering summer, Elio’s desire finds its purpose. He loves, and in loving, he becomes.","Armie Hammer, Timothée Chalamet, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar",N/A,"Italy, France, Brazil, USA",Luca Guadagnino,"Drama, Romance","English, Italian, French, German, Hebrew",93,"In 1980s Italy, a romance blossoms between a seventeen year-old student and the older man hired as his father's research assistant.",R,Sony Pictures Classics,"[{'Value': '8.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",19 Jan 2018,132 min,Call Me by Your Name,"James Ivory (screenplay by), André Aciman (based on the novel by)",2017,8,"126,492","[{'Value': '8.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '95%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '93/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",call me by your name,Call Me by Your Name,Sony Pictures Classics,161000.0,,4.0,40250.0,161000.0,1.0,17494.0

SCOTT,0,2017-12-21 17:44:01,Darkest Hour,"Review: ‘Darkest Hour,’ or the Great Man Theory of History (and Acting)",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/movies/darkest-hour-review-gary-oldman.html,2017-11-22,2017-11-21,Gary Oldman plays Winston Churchill in Joe Wright’s drama about the early days of World War II.,"In the late spring of 1940, German forces invaded Belgium and France and pushed most of the British army onto a beach in the French coastal town of Dunkirk. Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister best known (then and still) for his policy of appeasing Hitler, was replaced by Winston Churchill, whose first weeks as head of the government — culminating in the Dunkirk evacuation — are the subject of “Darkest Hour,” Joe Wright’s new film. (The evacuation itself was reconstructed in Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” released in July.)Considered as history, “Darkest Hour,” written by Anthony McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”), offers the public a few new insights and details about the practice of statecraft in a time of crisis. Churchill is disliked by many of his colleagues in the Conservative Party (notably Chamberlain and his vulpine sidekick, Viscount Halifax) and distrusted by King George VI. The political situation is shaky, the military reports dire. The new prime minister, a man of large emotions and larger appetites, who drinks whiskey with breakfast and is rarely without a cigar, is plagued by frustration and doubt as he tries to navigate between two bad options. Will Britain enter into a ruinous war or submit to humiliating and most likely temporary peace on terms dictated by Hitler?The contours of this story are reasonably familiar. The outcome even more so. (Just in case, a helpful text before the final credits reminds us that Germany eventually lost the war.) Churchill himself is among the most revered and studied figures of 20th-century history: a synonym for leadership; a great man in an age of monsters; a source of pithy quotations, some of which he actually said; an example to be cited by political mediocrities in need of an ego boost.And, of course, an irresistible role for actors of every shape and size. (His American counterpart in this regard is not Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill’s partner and peer, but Lyndon B. Johnson, who also possessed impressive jowls and a colorful way with words.) Gary Oldman, aided by diligent makeup artists and propelled by his own unmatched craft and discipline, embraces the task with almost palpable delight. The challenges facing Churchill are of lethal seriousness, but the key to his effectiveness is his capacity for pleasure. He enjoys the push and pull of politics, the intellectual labor of problem-solving and the daily adventure of being himself. In grasping that joy, Mr. Oldman partakes of it and passes it along to the audience. He is having fun, playing the part in every sense. And his blustery, blubbery charm, backed as it is by a sly and acute intelligence, is hard to resist.Apart from Halifax and Chamberlain, desiccated aristo puddings played by Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup, nobody makes much of an effort. Churchill is regarded with frank adoration by the camera and by the people, the women in particular, charged with the tasks of attending and indulging him. Kristin Scott Thomas is his wife, Clementine Churchill, a woman of brisk confidence and ironic disposition who long ago made peace with her secondary place in his public life. Lily James is his secretary, Elizabeth Layton, a clever and wide-eyed English rose who types Churchill’s correspondence and chastely buoys his morale at difficult moments.King George is played by Ben Mendelsohn as a weary and aloof sovereign — a chillier, sadder fellow than the version incarnated by Colin Firth in “The King’s Speech.” “Darkest Hour,” a companion to “Dunkirk,” is also in several senses a sequel to “The King’s Speech,” a mildly enjoyed best picture winner. It is similarly a movie about the production of an important piece of rhetoric, a “mobilization of the English language” in the service of a vital and righteous cause.And like “The King’s Speech,” Mr. Wright’s film is a serviceable enough historical drama. But like “Dunkirk,” it falls back on an idealized notion of the English character that feels, in present circumstances, less nostalgic than downright reactionary, and as empty as those ubiquitous “Keep Calm and Carry On” internet memes. Rather than invite the audience to think about the difficulties of democratic governance at a time of peril, the filmmakers promote passivity and hero-worship, offering not so much a Great Man Theory as a great man fetish. Their sham populism is most evident in a ridiculous scene in which Churchill rides the London Underground and meets The People, a motley mass of stiff upper lips and brimming eyes.Churchill’s resolve, like the bravery of the soldiers, airmen and ordinary Britons in “Dunkirk,” is offered not as a rebuke to the current generation, but rather as a sop, an easy and complacent fantasy of Imperial gumption and national unity. Standing up to the Nazis, an undeniably brave and good thing to have done, is treated like a moral check that can be cashed in perpetuity. “Darkest Hour” is proud of its hero, proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact. It wants you to share that pride, and to claim a share of it. But we have nothing to be proud of.","Gary Oldman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn, Lily James","$28,086,332","UK, USA",Joe Wright,"Biography, Drama, History, War","English, French, German",75,"In May 1940, the fate of Western Europe hangs on British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean a humiliating defeat for Britain and its empire.",PG-13,Focus Features,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Dec 2017,125 min,Darkest Hour,Anthony McCarten,2017,7.4,"115,961","[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '84%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '75/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",darkest hour,Darkest Hour,Focus Features,1771920.0,-10.0,943.0,1879.0,18132857.0,40.0,17531.0
49,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-12-21 17:44:01,Coco,Review: ‘Coco’ Brings the Pixar Touch to Death,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/movies/coco-review-pixar-disney.html,2017-11-22,2017-11-21,"The movie delivers moments of cinematic rigor and playful pop-culture erudition. And though it deals with the afterlife, don’t let that scare you.","One of the pleasures of a new Pixar feature is the chance to be amazed by what animation can do. Sometimes you witness a big, bold breakthrough, like the computer-assisted rendering of fur in “Monsters, Inc.,” of water in “Finding Nemo,” or of metal in “Cars.” The innovations in “Coco” are no less satisfying for being of a more subtle kind. The grain of leather and the rusted folds of corrugated metal have a rough, almost tactile quality. Human bones, hairless dogs and orange flower petals look uncannily (but not too uncannily) real. There are moments of cinematic rigor — when the animators mimic the movements and focal effects of an old-fashioned camera in actual physical space — that will warm any film-geek’s heart. Not to mention the Frida Kahlo-inspired musical number with dancing papaya seeds.“Coco” is also one of those Pixar movies that attempt a conceptual breakthrough, an application of the bright colors and open emotionalism of modern, mainstream animation to an unlikely zone of experience. From the very start, the studio has explored the inner lives of inanimate objects like lamps and toys with a tenderness we now take for granted. It has also summoned the post-human future (“Wall-E”) and the human unconscious (“Inside/Out”) with breathtaking ingenuity. And now it has set out to make a family-friendly cartoon about death.Don’t let that scare you or your children away. There is a murder (revealed in the third act) and a fatal church-bell-related accident (witnessed in the first), but the afterlife in “Coco” is a warm and hectic place, more comical than creepy. The story takes place during the Day of the Dead, when according to Mexican tradition (at least as interpreted by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, who directed the screenplay written by Mr. Molina and Matthew Aldrich), the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A young boy named Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) makes the trip in reverse, which is not to say that he dies, but rather that his living self, through one of several metaphysical loopholes that the movie explains as it goes along, is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons, who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts.Nearly as enchanting as that magical realm is the Mexican village of Santa Cecilia, Miguel’s hometown, where he is part of a prosperous clan of shoemakers. The cultural vibe of “Coco” is inclusive rather than exoticizing, pre-empting inevitable concerns about authenticity and appropriation with the mixture of charm and sensitivity that has become something of a 21st-century Disney hallmark. Here, the importance of family — the multigenerational household that sustains and constrains the hero — is both specific and universal. It’s what explains the particular beats of Miguel’s story and what connects him to viewers regardless of background.He shows a certain kinship with other well-known recent cartoon characters. A gifted musician in a family that forbids music, he is a bit like Remy, the “Ratatouille” rat whose kin were hostile to his artistic ambition, and like Mumble, the misfit penguin in “Happy Feet.” Miguel’s genealogical quest — a search for roots, lost ancestors and information that might explain who he is — resembles Dory’s journey in “Finding Dory.” The sidekicks who accompany him, animal and (formerly) human, are drawn from a familiar well of archetypes, and the final round of lesson-learning and reconciliation hits notes we have heard many times before.But if “Coco” doesn’t quite reach the highest level of Pixar masterpieces, it plays a time-tested tune with captivating originality and flair, and with roving, playful pop-culture erudition. Miguel’s musical role model — and the source of the family embargo on musical expression — is a long-dead crooner and movie star named Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). In life and in death, he incarnates venerable ideals of romance and wounded machismo, or at least their show-business incarnations. (His greatest hits and movie clips form part of the texture of “Coco,” the way the old “Woody’s Roundup” show did in the “Toy Story” movies.)The purer embodiment of that tradition is Héctor (Gael García Bernal), a ragged, forgotten ghost who befriends Miguel. What links Héctor with de la Cruz is a lurid story of passion, betrayal and longing. Their lives and deaths are a ballad whose meaning and melody Miguel must learn. In doing so, he will understand the thread that links him to both of them, and also the sources of the anti-musical animus that runs so strongly in his maternal line.Coco is the name of Miguel’s great-grandmother, who turns out to be the heart of the story. Her mother, Imelda (Alanna Noël Ubach), is a furious matriarch on the other side of the grave, while Coco’s daughter, Miguel’s Abuelita (Renée Victor), is a no-nonsense flesh-and-blood autocrat. Their determination to silence Miguel’s guitar arises from heartbreak, and from the instrument’s association with the waywardness of men.“Coco” avoids the darker tones associated with this theme, in the way that old murder ballads are sometimes reconceived as children’s songs. It’s reassuring rather than haunting, which is a shrewd and successful commercial compromise, but a compromise all the same.","Anthony Gonzalez, Gael García Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Alanna Ubach","&pound;208,487,719",USA,"Lee Unkrich, Adrian Molina(co-director)","Animation, Adventure, Comedy","English, Spanish",81,"Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.",PG,Disney/Pixar,"[{'Value': '8.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Nov 2017,105 min,Coco,"Lee Unkrich (original story by), Jason Katz (original story by), Matthew Aldrich (original story by), Adrian Molina (original story by), Adrian Molina (screenplay by), Matthew Aldrich (screenplay by)",2017,8.4,"221,294","[{'Value': '8.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '97%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '81/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",coco,Coco,Walt Disney,1852339.0,-33.0,2104.0,880.0,179834199.0,40.0,17531.0

True, the movie doesn’t ascribe everything in “A Christmas Carol” to autobiography: Dickens also has conversations with his characters, who, led by Christopher Plummer as Scrooge, appear to him like the Christmas ghosts and help him through his writer’s block. An Irish housemaid (Anna Murphy) also gives him notes.Brightly lit and anchored by Mr. Stevens’s infectious, live-wire performance, the film, directed by Bharat Nalluri (“Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day”), nevertheless proceeds like a television holiday special, designed to distract children while winking at their parents. Interesting historical tidbits — William Makepeace Thackeray (Miles Jupp) appears as a periodic irritant for the protagonist — share screen time with a fair amount of whimsical nonsense that explains away Dickens’s imagination, prose style and gift for names with what Orson Welles called “dollar-book Freud.”","Dan Stevens, Mark Schrier, Patrick Joseph Byrnes, Miriam Margolyes","&pound;5,652,908","Ireland, Canada",Bharat Nalluri,"Biography, Comedy, Drama",English,60,"The journey that led to Charles Dickens' creation of ""A Christmas Carol,"" a timeless tale that would redefine Christmas.",PG,Bleecker Street,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Nov 2017,104 min,The Man Who Invented Christmas,"Susan Coyne, Les Standiford (based on ""The Man Who Invented Christmas"" by), Charles Dickens (inspired by ""A Christmas Carol"")",2017,7,"5,570","[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '80%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '60/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the man who invented christmas,The Man Who Invented Christmas,Bleecker Street,17652.0,-31.0,146.0,121.0,5575759.0,40.0,17531.0

The cat, also this movie’s title character, has some metaphoric weight, representing the life Emily left behind. She now wonders if she should have.As portrayed by the film’s writer and director, Noël Wells, Emily, while mercurially talented, has little idea where she’s going. Upon her Austin return, she witnesses the rather Williams-Sonoma-inflected life her ex, Eric (Nick Thune), has with a very tidy new partner, Celeste (Britt Lower). This raises a welter of resentment in the far less genteel Emily.A restaurant disaster, during which Emily has a semi-meltdown and spills food all over a borrowed dress, leads her into the view of a waitress, Jen (Daniella Pineda), who’s still pursuing the boho dream in the increasingly bourgeois town. Under Jen’s wing, Emily gets reacquainted with the less proper side of Austin, in which she’s still sometimes at a loss. Potentially topless bathing at the local swimming hole and other challenges lead Emily to some poor decisions (she opts to sleep with a man who’s a little too much like the Los Angeles dirtbags she’s been hooking up with), and some maybe less-poor ones (delivering a few genuine apologies), as she ties up loose ends.Ms. Wells is appealing onscreen and is a smart writer. She gives Emily some good zingers, including a riff about the inherent sexism of the word “quirky” and one-liners like “burritos are just sleeping bags for rice.” The film fits comfortably into the lineage of movies like “Tiny Furniture” and “Obvious Child,” about young women trying to make sense of their lives, although it’s not quite distinctive enough to be considered outstanding in that company.

52,A.O. SCOTT,1,2017-12-16 17:44:01,Mudbound,"Review: ‘Mudbound’ Is a Racial Epic Tuned to Black Lives, and White Guilt",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/mudbound-review-dee-rees.html,2017-11-17,2017-11-16,Dee Rees’s new film illuminates the daily cruelties in post-World War II Mississippi.,"“Mudbound” is a movie about how things change — slowly, unevenly, painfully. It is also, as the title suggests, about how things don’t change, about the stubborn forces of custom, prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II, when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice, the film, directed by Dee Rees, tests and complicates William Faulkner’s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past. It’s a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting, illuminating force.The particular corner of the past that Ms. Rees investigates is not entirely unfamiliar. The source of the screenplay for “Mudbound” (which the director wrote with Virgil Williams) is a novel by Hillary Jordan that counts Faulkner and Toni Morrison among its evident literary influences. On film, the racial history of the American South tends to be flattened into reassuring morality tales in which black lives matter less than white consciences. Ms. Jordan’s book occasionally wanders in the direction of this kind of soothing, redemptive storytelling — the white characters are split a bit too neatly into the righteous and the wicked, their black counterparts confined to salt-of-the-earth nobility — but the movie resists this tendency. Its people, members of two families knotted together by fate, hate and economics, are complicated. The wounds are raw.What you notice first of all, though, is the land those people inhabit, a sometimes dusty, sometimes swampy area of broad fields and dirt roads that seems indifferent to human concerns. The cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, brings the soil, the flora and the weather to life in a way that emphasizes the archaic, elemental power of the story. Its modern implications are supplied by a cast of subtle actors and by Ms. Rees’s knack for psychological nuance, an attentiveness to quiet moments and unstated emotions that animates her earlier films, the independent coming-of-age drama “Pariah” and the HBO biopic “Bessie.”“Mudbound” provides her a larger canvas and a sprawling, crowded plot. Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique, but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing, but instead, remarkably enough, they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy, but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved.The Jacksons are African-American tenant farmers who have managed, through years of toil, to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry’s feckless younger brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), befriends the Jacksons’ oldest son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans, and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation, particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry’s father, a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks).Pappy’s snarling, slur-spewing villainy verges on caricature, but “Mudbound” does not pretend that his is the only, or even the most insidious, face of white supremacy. Nor does the film locate the poison of racism principally in the attitudes and feelings of the dominant race. What Hap and Florence are up against as they try to provide for their children and hold onto their dignity is a system of organized expropriation — a heritage of plunder (to borrow a term from the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates) designed to keep them poor, precarious and dependent. Their labor provides an insurance policy for Henry’s bad luck and incompetence. Their successes will be punished so his failures can be mitigated and his entitlement upheld. What’s theirs is his.The more sympathetic members of the McAllan clan — Laura, a bookish, musical, cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband’s will, and Jamie, a dissolute, poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized — are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars, black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie, in his blithe disregard for local norms, is protected in a way Ronsel is not, and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences.I won’t spell those out. “Mudbound” begins with the digging of a grave and then jumps backward in time to move slowly toward the shadow of at least one death. Along the way, quite a lot happens — a bit too much, perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything, and she uses Ms. Jordan’s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine.

The giggles start with the playful title: “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton.” It’s an amusing pileup that in its excess hints at the rich weirdness that emerged when Mr. Carrey nearly went off the rails playing Kaufman in the biopic “Man on the Moon.” One of those tidy, fumbled stories of genius, it will be forever supplanted by this movie’s dizzily, fantastically entertaining account of its two strange, twinned and messy geniuses.Kaufman, who died from lung cancer in 1984, was a standup who hit the mainstream playing Latka Gravas, a mechanic of indeterminate national origin, in the sitcom “Taxi.” That show was a critical favorite, if not a ratings behemoth, and it goosed the big-screen careers of some of its players (Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd). Kaufman wasn’t made for movies, but in live shows as well as on “Saturday Night Live” and on talk shows (David Letterman), he continued to test the limits of his singular absurdist comedy by assuming the guise of innocent fools or spectacularly awful louts. Kaufman is still sometimes referred to as a cult comic, a category that skews reductive decades later.“Jim & Andy” revisits Kaufman’s tragically abridged story, largely through Mr. Carrey’s experiences playing him. By the time Mr. Carrey signed on to make “Man on the Moon” (1999), he was a major movie star, having appeared in both commercial hits (“Dumb and Dumber”) and critical successes (“The Truman Show”). Physically, he may have seemed a bit off to play Kaufman (too lanky, too crowned with hair), but he took on the role with painstaking if seemingly typical actorly mimicry. Mr. Carrey found the character in big and little ways: in Kaufman’s many voices, his fixed stare and in the walks, stances and gestures he used to play characters or when he was just being (or playing) Andy.“Jim & Andy” suggests that in finding Kaufman, Mr. Carrey also lost himself, at least for a while (though maybe longer). The story of what happened during the making of “Man on the Moon” has been covered before, including in news articles published around the time of its release. In one, a journalist who visited the set during production noted that Mr. Carrey never broke character even after cut was called. In another account, Mr. DeVito, who played George Shapiro, Andy Kaufman’s manager in “Man on the Moon,” said Mr. Carrey dove so deeply into his role as Kaufman that “Jim only came to work two days during the filming.” That sure sounds like the final word on the Carrey-Kaufman cinematic convergence.Directed by Chris Smith, “Jim & Andy” reveals that those earlier reports — which read as if yet another performer had taken the whole Method acting thing a touch too far — hardly get at the strangeness that materialized (and lingers). “So, Jim, how would you start this movie?,” an offscreen Mr. Smith asks Mr. Carrey at the start. Seated in what looks like an anonymous hotel room and wearing a luxurious beard and a leather jacket, Mr. Carrey grunts softly and glances away. And then, looking directly into the camera, he says: “Well, if I had my choice, it wouldn’t start at all. It would already have been.” Mr. Carrey breaks into a small, ambiguous smile. “And it wouldn’t end, either.”Is Mr. Carrey smiling at his words or his memories (or at us)? It can be hard to know, an uncertainty that fits the movie’s exploration of reality and its simulations. By contrast, the documentary’s genesis, which is partly spelled out in title cards, is rather clearer and can be traced to some 100 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during the making of “Man on the Moon.” This material had been stashed in Mr. Carrey’s offices for almost 20 years until the director Spike Jonze (“Her”), a producer on “Jim & Andy,” persuaded Mr. Carrey to do something with it. Mr. Smith, whose earlier titles include “American Movie” and “The Yes Men,” was hired and smartly set his focus on Mr. Carrey.The result isn’t another ho-hum documentary likeness in which all the elements neatly and often flatteringly stack up. “Jim & Andy” is instead a complexly layered and textured Cubist portrait, one that’s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work. In one corner of the portrait there’s something from Mr. Carrey’s life (a story about his father, a glimpse of an early routine); in another, something from Kaufman’s personal history (his family, his work, his illness). Sometimes these fragments rest side by side, at other times they overlap. And, every so often, Kaufman’s notorious alter ego Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge lizard, muscles in to upend the entire thing.“Jim & Andy” folds a lot into its 95 minutes. It slides from art to life — thoughtfully poking around in that blurred space between them — and jumps around in time, all while flipping from Kaufman to Mr. Carrey and then to Mr. Carrey as Mr. Kaufman. (The editor is Barry Poltermann.) You never get lost amid all these multiple identities and realities, which Mr. Smith amusingly, at times alarmingly, gathers together. It’s funny watching Milos Forman — who directed “Man on the Moon” — refer to Mr. Carrey as Andy, but when Mr. Carrey turns into Tony Clifton something more sinister and menacing comes through. Is this art, indulgence or madness? As this documentary reminds you, with hard laughter and startlingly intense emotion, comedy always needs its pound of flesh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I think “The Breadwinner” is worth celebrating, in part because it is a work that in some ways qualifies as reportage.Deborah Ellis, the Canadian author on whose children’s novel this movie is based, traveled in the late ’90s to Pakistan, where she interviewed Afghan refugees fleeing war and Taliban rule. The hero of her book and its sequels is Parvana, a young girl we first see in this movie with her father, an out-of-work teacher. They are selling some prized possessions in a market square when Parvana’s father is arrested without charges.Forbidden by roaming Taliban from so much as walking outside by herself, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her mother, older sister and baby brother. As she deals with ever-mounting difficulties, she expands on a story she and her father had started to concoct before his arrest. Depicted in cutout animation style, it tells of a young prince out to confront an elephant king.Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror. The director, Nora Twomey, has a nuanced way with characterization and action, and the voice cast, led by Saara Chaudry of “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” is terrific. In its alternating of Parvana’s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself, the movie doesn’t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality. Rather, it demonstrates that the way imagination refracts reality can provide not only solace but also real-world strategy.","Saara Chaudry, Soma Chhaya, Noorin Gulamgaus, Laara Sadiq","&pound;228,056","Ireland, Canada, Luxembourg",Nora Twomey,"Animation, Drama, Family",English,78,"In 2001, Afghanistan is under the control of the Taliban.

When the helmet is removed, we know how he knows what he knows: His young face is scarred, his earlobes are little flaps and his eyes are seemingly tear-shaped, giving him a perpetual sad-puppy expression.The good-natured fellow describes his facial birth defects, and the 27 operations he’s endured to deal with them, as “hilarious.” But Auggie is less amused by the prospect of entering the fifth grade, and no longer being home-schooled by his brilliant and loving mother, Isabel Pullman (Julia Roberts).The Pullmans are an upper-middle-class family living in a fairy-tale New York, one that the film’s location manager conjured up from the most genteel corners of Brooklyn and Manhattan (as well as New Westminster, British Columbia, where the interior of the family’s brownstone was built on a warehouse stage). So Auggie, whose father, Nate (Owen Wilson), has a job that lets him wear a suit and sneakers, is certainly going to a good school. Nonetheless, he knows that he will encounter bullies, and he does. But Auggie is smart, clever and exceptionally good-hearted (at least when he is not being made to feel self-conscious and alone), and has a knack for winning people over.The movie, based on the popular children’s novel by R.J. Palacio, hews to the book’s multicharacter narration structure. This tactic reminded me of a line in Jean Renoir’s classic “The Rules of the Game” about everybody having their own reasons for their behavior. In Renoir’s movie, that fact is called a “truly terrible thing.” In the world of this film, understanding another person’s reasons is the first step in establishing meaningful communication. During the section of the film narrated by Auggie’s older sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), you learn why, in an awkward first conversation with her future boyfriend, she impulsively tells him that she’s an only child, despite the fact that she loves and ardently protects her little brother.Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, the movie has a cast that’s wonderful from top to bottom. As Auggie’s parents, Ms. Roberts and Mr. Wilson are doing things we love to see those actors doing. (Ms. Roberts lets loose with her trademark ebullient laugh at least once, and Mr. Wilson explains life’s issues to Auggie in a droll drawl.) All the young people in the ensemble, anchored by Mr. Tremblay’s Auggie, are perfect.“Wonder” is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering. Mr. Chbosky’s 2012 feature, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” split the difference between the sentimental heart-tugging associated with more standard Hollywood fare, and the intelligence and intimacy often associated with independent films. He accomplishes something very similar, and equally worthwhile, here.","Jacob Tremblay, Owen Wilson, Izabela Vidovic, Julia Roberts","$132,090,170","USA, Hong Kong",Stephen Chbosky,"Drama, Family",English,66,"Based on the New York Times bestseller, this movie tells the incredibly inspiring and heartwarming story of August Pullman, a boy with facial differences who enters the fifth grade, attending a mainstream elementary school for the first time.",PG,Lionsgate,"[{'Value': '8.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",17 Nov 2017,113 min,Wonder,"Stephen Chbosky (screenplay by), Steve Conrad (screenplay by), Jack Thorne (screenplay by), R.J.

Then there’s the proprietor of a coffee shop who can’t seem to keep his mind on his business, and a server at said coffee shop, who may or may not be the proprietor’s mistress — but who definitely has an amorous interest in the playwright.The setup and characters are a little reminiscent of a film by the Korean anatomist of bad romance Hong Sang-soo. But this isn’t any such thing.“Wet Woman in the Wind,” directed by Akihiko Shiota, is more concerned with sex than sexual neuroses. The movie is one of several recent postmodern reboots of what has been called “roman porno,” a subgenre of erotic cinema that was very popular in Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. These were cheaply made soft-core pictures that could get away with a lot of aesthetic quirkiness, on account of also featuring images of half-naked women like clockwork. Nikkatsu, the studio that pioneered the form, is now commissioning new films as a kind of cheeky self-homage.But let’s make no bones about it: This is a film designed to appeal to straight male prurient interest. Yuki Mamiya, who plays Shiori, the title character, has a smoldering quality that fills the bill. Much less winning is the way the movie treats consent, as in the playwright’s rough “seduction” of a very young fan. Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off — and worse.

Israel, Esq.,’ Denzel Washington as a Lawyer Out of His Element",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/roman-j-israel-review-denzel-washington.html,2017-11-22,2017-11-16,Dan Gilroy’s new film about a socially awkward jurist misfires when it appoints him as a sort of angelic figure.,"Partly because of economics, partly because of a lack of imagination, Hollywood barely makes character-driven movies anymore. So there is a sense in which “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” a wildly idiosyncratic drama about a wildly idiosyncratic lawyer, deserves not only critical leniency, but also maybe your investment.Yet this film doesn’t do the cause many favors. It certainly doesn’t serve Denzel Washington, in a role unlike any he has played that nevertheless saddles him with a collection of tics meant to compensate for the underrealized complexity of the part. And it offers tonal whiplash for viewers, with several potentially great ideas that don’t settle into a coherent whole. The movie starts in the vein of a ruthlessly intelligent drama like “Michael Clayton” before racing through adversity, running a couple of unearned victory laps and landing just shy of a mawkish Will Smith vehicle like “Seven Pounds.”The film was written and directed by Dan Gilroy, whose “Nightcrawler” centered on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a monomaniacal cameraman whose lack of a moral compass allowed him to succeed in local television news. Roman Israel (Mr. Washington) is equally single-minded in his pursuits, but otherwise he’s Lou’s opposite: a hapless striver whose compulsions interfere with his ambitions.Roman keeps to his office in a small Los Angeles firm. He is a whiz with briefs and apparently knows the legal code by number, but his partner is always the one who appears in court, having more tolerance for what Roman calls the “butchery” of plea deals and excessive sentences. When the partner has a heart attack, Roman, who can’t run the firm alone or stop himself from talking back to a judge, eventually takes a job with George Pierce (Colin Farrell), a high-flying lawyer who doesn’t necessarily share Roman’s ideals.A veteran social reformer with a dated hairstyle and glasses that only exaggerate his awkwardness, Roman is almost certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. In a performance that’s meant to grate, Mr. Washington highlights the character’s difficulty making eye contact and his habit of laughing and smiling with too much emphasis. As intriguing as it is to watch a movie about someone who is gifted yet hamstrung by his own mind, you do wonder whether — after Roman and Lou — Mr. Gilroy is capable of writing protagonists who aren’t so affectedly at odds with their environments.The fish-out-of-water clash at the firm is absorbing enough, but the movie misfires when it appoints Roman as a sort of an angelic figure (or, as his last name may signal, a prophet). Carmen Ejogo appears as a younger civil rights advocate who, unlike the other activists we meet from her generation, recognizes Roman’s past contributions and explains that she feels privileged to know him. Roman even begins to grow on George, who inexplicably warms to him just as Roman is wreaking havoc at the firm. And when Roman makes not one but two symbolic getaways — one to Santa Monica, one to the desert — “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” seems like a movie that has no idea where it’s heading.While “Nightcrawler” delivered its bludgeoning lecture on TV sensationalism about four decades too late, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” goes oddly easy on the cruel bureaucracy of the legal system. Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not. Mr. Gilroy, perhaps similarly caught between integrity and commercial calculation, gets as lost as his hero.","Denzel Washington, Colin Farrell, Carmen Ejogo, Lynda Gravatt","$11,887,893","Canada, United Arab Emirates, USA",Dan Gilroy,"Crime, Drama",English,58,"Roman J.

The delay probably explains why the film takes nearly 40 minutes to deliver a glorified walk-on from Melissa McCarthy, who wasn’t nearly as major a star when it was made, or why she and the other well-known actors look about a decade younger.Like the can that got lost in the pantry and is now showing telltales of botulism risk, this misbegotten mockumentary, directed by Guy Shalem and Cathryn Michon (though only Mr. Shalem was credited in 2007), hasn’t been improved by time. The movie tries to do for amateur cooking contests what “Best in Show” did for dog competitions, but the strained folksiness and tired stereotypes couldn’t be further from the snap and wit of prime Christopher Guest.The contestants include Sharon (Ms. Michon) and Pauline (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a pair of sisters from Minnesota. Sharon is engaged to a closeted African-American Lutheran (Gary Anthony Williams) whose mere existence the movie seems to regard as humorous.In a film with no shortage of wacky food names (“that-time-of-the-month crab puffs”) or kitchen disasters, Pauline’s creamed corn for the lactose intolerant is the only recipe that sounds remotely edible. What Ms. McCarthy does with sweet potatoes and way too many marshmallows is more likely to elicit a retch than a laugh — and suggests a culinary correlative to the way “Cook Off!” has been slapped together.","Louie Anderson, Nick Rey Angelus, Diedrich Bader, Jordan Black",N/A,USA,"Cathryn Michon, Guy Shalem",Comedy,English,N/A,"Amateur ""chefs"" from around the country compete for a million dollar prize in the ultimate food fight.",R,N/A,"[{'Value': '4.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",17 Nov 2017,98 min,Cook Off!,"Cathryn Michon, Wendi McLendon-Covey, W.

The cinematography isn’t the greatest, and the structure is hit or miss, but so what? In a movie this good natured, the heart is everything.The performances are hilarious, but the dancing is no joke. As Gia Kourlas, a dance critic for The New York Times, points out, it takes exceptionally strong technique to merge classical choreography and comedy. Achieving what James Whiteside, a principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, calls “a balance between high art and clever camp” requires endless rehearsal and often physical therapy. Hoisting a 150-lb. man aloft is not for the weak-kneed.Born from the dust of the Stonewall riots in the 1970s (the name is a homage to the legendary Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo), the company was initially blackballed by financiers and quickly learned to survive on a budget. Leading us lightly through that history, the artistic director and the movie’s unofficial narrator, Tory Dobrin, describes the devastation of AIDS and the relief of creating a space where dancers could forge their own identities. Giving the middle finger to classical ballet was just gravy.Filming for four years, Ms. Hart follows a handful of touching individual stories and takes us on the road (the Trocks, as they are known, are rock stars in Japan), a punishing travel schedule that gobbles up more than two-thirds of the year.

(Psst … where’s Superman?)","“Justice League,” the newest DC Comics superhero jam directed by Zack Snyder, is looser, goosier and certainly more watchable than the last one. The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he’s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne — played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck — takes the lead on this enterprise. He’s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens (“critical damage” reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He’s also pretty much of a yawn.The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman’s (or Bruce’s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She’s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie’s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (“Gone Girl”), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work.As it is, the little bit of bat brooding in “Justice League” feels unmotivated and unearned, and lacks the shading of the character in the “Dark Knight” or even in the Lego movies. That’s too bad, and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But “Justice League” is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo, so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a machine man built from metal and serious attitude.The original Justice League of America (as it was called) first convened in 1960; the movie takes place in the present or at least a facsimile of the same. The world is in mourning for Superman, and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams, shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse, because of course it has to, leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers, who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story — one has roots in Atlantis, the other two are from hard-luck city — while flexing individual quirks and superpowers.“Justice League” settles into a groove once it finds its gang. As Bat-Bruce moodily pushes and prods and Wonder-Diana smiles and smirks, the newbies jockey for position. The Flash gets most of the best jokes, and Mr. Miller makes most of them work, largely in the role of in-house fanboy with a touch of the Cowardly Lion. It’s golly-gee stuff, but it’s also human and Mr. Miller keeps you hooked, as does Mr. Momoa (“Game of Thrones”), who supplely shifts between gravitas and comedy. When Aquaman chugs a bottle of booze before plunging into an angry sea, the movie hits the comic-book sweet spot between deadly seriousness and self-amused levity.Cyborg isn’t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who’s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can’t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn’t or can’t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.Mr. Snyder remains regrettably committed to a dark, desaturated palette that borders on the murky, and this movie’s chaotic, unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in “Justice League” lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike “Batman v Superman,” which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (“Justice League” clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the new movie shows a series that’s still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel’s, may be more enduring (and golden). It has justice, and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out, more breeziness, it is a start.","Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot","$227,032,490","UK, Canada, USA",Zack Snyder,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","English, Irish, Russian, Icelandic",45,"Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy.",PG-13,Warner Bros.

Mr. Heaney was recognized as a master of sean nos (old style) music, a traditional Gaelic variety of a cappella.He was also an enigmatic figure, according to the film’s director Pat Collins, and “Song of Granite” seems to mirror what the character says about singing. As long as it does right by the music — of which there is plenty — everything else can be a fog.Shot in black-and-white, the movie tries to shake off the biopic doldrums, employing a fragmented structure that emphasizes isolated moments instead of a narrative arc. It also includes snippets of the actual Mr. Heaney talking or in performance. But Mr. Collins doesn’t shed light on what makes his subject tick, and the arty shards never cohere.Mr. Collins has cast real singers. Mr. Heaney is played as a boy by the poised Colm Seoighe, then as a haunted, noirish figure by Mr. O Chonfhaola. The character actor Macdara O Fatharta plays him as an older man. The first movement, observing the young Mr. Heaney as he absorbs Irish folk culture in County Galway, is the best and most accessible, before Mr. Heaney goes into moody exile in Britain and New York.Offering scant commentary on the music, “Song of Granite” will appeal more to enthusiasts than to newcomers.","Michael O'Chonfhlaola, Macdara Ó Fátharta, Jaren Cerf, Pól Ó Ceannabháin","$4,230","Ireland, Canada",Pat Collins,"Biography, Drama","Irish, English",68,"Acclaimed filmmaker Pat Collins brings the dramatic life story of legendary seannós singer Joe Heaney to the screen in THE SONG IN GRANITE, an audacious exploration of the man and his music...",N/A,Marcie Films Limited,"[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",15 Nov 2017,104 min,Song of Granite,"Pat Collins, Eoghan Mac Giolla Bhríde, Sharon Whooley",2017,6.6,145,"[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '87%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '68/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",song of granite,,,,,,,,,

The result is effective.,"The Icelandic director Oskar Thor Axelsson is clearly fluent in horror conventions. But he has commendable restraint, and his latest film, “I Remember You,” transcends genre pyrotechnics even as it incorporates elements of Nordic noir.The film — adapted by Mr. Axelsson and Otto Geir Borg from a novel of the same name (subtitled “A Ghost Story” in one edition) by Yrsa Sigurdardottir — tells of the entwining fates of three victims of acute misfortune.Freyr (Johannes Haukur Johannesson) is a psychiatrist tormented by the memory of his son, who mysteriously vanished years ago in a game of hide-and-seek. Now Freyr is enlisted by the police to interview the husband of an old woman who has killed herself. Working with a detective (Sara Dogg Asgeirsdottir), he uncovers multiple deaths linked to the suicide, all connected by a crime in the distant past.Grievous loss also afflicts Katrin (Anna Gunndis Gudmundsdottir) and her husband, Gardar (Thorvaldur David Kristjansson), who — with a friend, Lif (Agusta Eva Erlendsdottir) — have started renovating a decrepit house in Iceland’s remote and stunningly stark Westfjords region. As Katrin wrestles with psychological demons, she senses a more supernatural threat.And then there is Bernodus (Arnar Pall Hardarson), an abused child from long ago whose life, death and afterlife yield grave consequences.Mr. Axelsson knows his faded photographs, eye-blink spectral visitations and droning soundtracks, plus that standby: the wall covered with newspaper clippings of serial murder. But he minimizes the gore, piercing the soul with mood and compelling human conflict. Which makes “I Remember You” memorable indeed.","Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson, Ágústa Eva Erlendsdóttir, Elma Stefania Agustsdottir, Thor Kristjansson",N/A,Iceland,Óskar Thór Axelsson,"Drama, Horror, Mystery",Icelandic,N/A,A story about a young man and woman who move into a small abandoned town in Iceland to renovate an old house.

Outside, the frantic sound of barking dogs fills her leafy suburb; inside, the ceaseless demands of four children and a callously philandering husband, Bill (Jason Ritter), render her pain invisible.Like the great Mary Chapin Carpenter song “He Thinks He’ll Keep Her,” “Bitch” is about a woman who has reached the end of her leash. A satirical scream of rage against patriarchal prerogatives, this feminist horror-comedy, written and directed by Ms. Palka, has a vicious edge that can stifle your laughter. So when Jill takes to her basement, snarling and covered in her own feces, her belief that she’s the dog her family seems to think she is comes across as more tragic than funny.The title, though, has a dual meaning; and it’s in Bill’s furiously baffled response to his wife’s abandonment of her parental responsibilities that the movie finds its footing and its humor. As she did in her gentler but equally original “Good Dick” in 2008, Ms. Palka carves a black and biting niche between a man and a woman, a space where chaos and psychological unease demand to be reckoned with. Emphasizing this, Morgan Z. Whirledge’s dense and darting score builds an atmosphere of unnerving upheaval — essential to a movie relying on mood rather than special effects.Eventually losing momentum (but not its fealty to Jill’s desperation), “Bitch” leans heavily on Mr. Ritter’s energetic grounding of its bizarre premise. Alternately manic and maddened, Bill is like a red flag to overly smug husbands, wildly warning of the comeuppance to come.","Marianna Palka, Jason Ritter, Jaime King, Brighton Sharbino",N/A,USA,Marianna Palka,"Comedy, Drama, Thriller",English,55,"A woman snaps and assumes the psyche of a vicious dog as her checked-out, philandering husband attempts to keep the family together.",R,N/A,"[{'Value': '5.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",10 Nov 2017,93 min,Bitch,Marianna Palka,2017,5,"1,197","[{'Value': '5.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '55/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",bitch,,,,,,,,,

Voiced by the actress Sandra Oh, Rosie is of Chinese and Iranian descent, but she is disconnected from her family history — her mother is dead and her father abandoned the family long ago. Instead, Rosie writes poems in an ode to Paris, her dream city. But when she is invited to present her work at a poetry festival in Shiraz, Iran, she meets poets who expand her ideas about the art form and about herself.Rosie listens as diverse artists share personal experiences and national histories through their poetry. The writing in “Window Horses” is unaffected and lovely, with each poem animated in a different style to reflect the variety of life on display. One man was exiled from China after the protests in Tiananmen Square. Another recites Persian poets from the 13th century. None of these artists romanticize France.Though many of the characters in “Window Horses” share a lively Cubist design, Rosie is the most sparingly-drawn figure onscreen. She is depicted as a stick figure with two small slants for eyes, a rendering that reads as a reclamation of Asian stereotypes by the director Ann Marie Fleming, who is also of Chinese descent. At first, Rosie’s simplicity is jarring. But as the character learns more about her personal and poetic origins, her minimalist frame absorbs the weight of a rich, complex history. That transformation is the great pleasure of watching this small film.","Ellen Page, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Sandra Oh, Navid Negahban",N/A,Canada,Ann Marie Fleming,Animation,English,82,A young Canadian poet with Chinese and Persian parents travels to Iran to perform at a poetry festival.,N/A,First Pond Entertainment,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",10 Nov 2017,85 min,Window Horses: The Poetic Persian Epiphany of Rosie Ming,Ann Marie Fleming (screenplay),2016,6.8,318,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '91%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '82/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",window horses: the poetic persian epiphany of rosie ming,,,,,,,,,

At the start of “Daddy’s Home 2,” the now-buddies have figured out a way to share parenting duties.When their own fathers arrive for Christmas, several barely disguised gags from the first movie repeat. Don (John Lithgow) proves as cringingly lovey-dovey as his son, Brad; Kurt (Mel Gibson), Dusty’s father, is a crass repository of growls, backslaps and chauvinist remarks. Kurt’s only trait that doesn’t scream “Gibson” is that he is supposed to be a former astronaut.To punch up the families’ winter holiday, Kurt books an impromptu getaway on Airbnb. You might think the late reservation is the setup for a joke, but no, it’s just product placement. In the ensuing events (“story” is a little strong for a movie content to throw its characters from one vacation activity to another), the men peacock, agreeing only — and inexplicably — on thermostat etiquette. Ms. Cardellini and Alessandra Ambrosio, as Dusty’s new wife, have a score of their own to settle but should count every moment on the sidelines as a mercy.Hollywood may be determined to rehabilitate Mr. Gibson, but it’s no stretch to imagine him as a man who cracks a hooker joke in front of children or lectures his granddaughter about how men hunt and women cook.

What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.Joe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of “The Promise,” a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger’s plan is smart as well as symbolic — evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it’s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.At its core, “Intent to Destroy” is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. “If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,” one scholar says near the end of the documentary. “History is not in the past.”","Shohreh Aghdashloo, Taner Akçam, Hagop Asadourian, Peter Balakian",N/A,USA,Joe Berlinger,Documentary,English,N/A,Filmmaker Joe Berlinger meets with historians and scholars to discuss the Armenian Genocide and the continuing denial by the Turkish government of it ever happening.,N/A,Abramorama,"[{'Value': '8.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",10 Nov 2017,115 min,Intent to Destroy,"Joe Berlinger, Cy Christiansen",2017,8.5,246,"[{'Value': '8.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '92%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}]",intent to destroy,,,,,,,,,

Yet here he is in “Mayhem,” still happily slaying zombielike antagonists and up to his armpits in gore.He isn’t the only one seeking comfort in the familiar. Jumping on the rage-virus bandwagon popularized by the “[REC]” franchise, among others, Matias Caruso’s script unfolds in a gleaming, high-rise law firm where Derek (Mr. Yeun) is being unjustly fired for his boss’s error. At the same time, we learn that the building is under quarantine because of an inhibition-erasing infection that turns eyeballs red and regular people into sex- and violence-crazed lunatics.As Derek and a disgruntled client (a gung-ho Samara Weaving) fall prey to the virus and join forces to wipe out the firm’s slimy C.E.O. — and anyone who tries to stop them — the director, Joe Lynch, concocts an uneven blend of video game setups and corporate satire. Given that speed and splatter are typically paramount in movies like this, the decision to slow the slaughter every so often to navigate workplace politics feels ill-advised — especially when Derek’s nail gun and selection of lethal office supplies are a long way from exhausted.Coolly photographed by Steve Gainer, “Mayhem” embraces its pulpy title with fighting-and-fornicating glee. Neither innovative nor particularly clever, the movie understands its mission and benefits from Mr. Yeun’s unfailing air of basic decency.

It happens during an uneasily intimate encounter between her character, a tough number named Mildred, and an ailing police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Until then, Mildred has seemed impervious to his pain. She has rented three billboards attacking his failure to solve her daughter’s murder — one reads “Raped While Dying” — and has been so wrapped up in her hurt that she hasn’t seen anyone else’s. When she realizes how sick Willoughby is, she looks at him as if for the first time. She’s staggered, and so are you.The pain of others haunts “Three Billboards,” at least whenever the writer-director Martin McDonagh lets it. A playwright (“The Pillowman”) turned filmmaker (“In Bruges”) who’s somewhat of a subgenre unto himself, Mr. McDonagh is a pain artist whose tools include absurd violence, cruel laughs and sucker punches. He skated through his last movie, “Seven Psychopaths,” a barely there comedy that pivots on a creatively stalled screenwriter. As this précis suggests, Mr. McDonagh doesn’t have much to say in that movie — it has a bunny, stolen dogs, guys with guns, good and bad jokes — but what little is said is said by very fine performers grooving on all his words and larky nonsense.“Three Billboards” is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh’s earlier features. Like the older ones, it has loads of gab, plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly, if not satisfyingly, shifts between comedy and tragedy — a McDonagh specialty — splattering blood along the way. This time, though, he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances, a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly, he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers — primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell — to play to their range.The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It’s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color, but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity, she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren’t blank — the faded image of a baby smiles down from one, the word “life” pops off another — but they’re the opening pages in Mildred’s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background, she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story’s fundamentals: its setting, characters, problem, plot and possible villain.The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred, a way to get things jumping (the investigators, the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage, confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter’s death, grief has walled her in; isolating and seemingly impenetrable, it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon, a means of taking on the law and assorted men — a threatening stranger, a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) — who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in.Mr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies, at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat, giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn’t always know his A material from his B, or doesn’t care; his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material’s clichés and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in “Three Billboards,” even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn’t always feel so worked.Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully. A performer of great unforced naturalism, she has always come across more like a character actor than a star, even when she has the lead. She never seems concerned about losing the audience’s love or its sympathy, which can be thrilling, particularly given that female performers are often asked to pander or seduce. In this movie, she makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture: It squares Mildred’s jaw, hardens her mouth and turns her face to stone, as if she were further fortifying her defenses. But pain also makes her ugly, maybe irredeemable, which also makes her joltingly, excitingly human.That same stone face is good for comedy, too, even if Mr. McDonagh’s bids at humor grow progressively less successful. He plays with tones, realisms and ideas in “Three Billboards,” including the sentimentally redeemed white racist, a character that suggests — despite the rage and invective — that Mr. McDonagh holds out hope for humanity after all. The problem is that the idea he hits most insistently is that vengeance is the hurt that never subsides; it’s the hurt that Mildred nurtures and that hardens her and that, over time, becomes so brutally consuming its violence is all but indistinguishable from its cause. Ms. McDormand still breaks your heart, but Mr. McDonagh just wears you out.","Frances McDormand, Caleb Landry Jones, Kerry Condon, Sam Rockwell","$52,000,189","UK, USA",Martin McDonagh,"Comedy, Crime, Drama",English,88,A mother personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder when they fail to catch the culprit.,R,Fox Searchlight Pictures,"[{'Value': '8.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Dec 2017,115 min,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",Martin McDonagh,2017,8.2,"281,916","[{'Value': '8.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '92%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '88/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]","three billboards outside ebbing, missouri",,,,,,,,,

In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie’s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It’s very novel; whether it’s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet’s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven’t read the book.Mr. Finney’s embodiment of Poirot in the Lumet picture was a marathon of sorts, with the actor testing how many of the beloved character’s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence. In this latest version, Kenneth Branagh, who also directs (from a script by Michael Green), gives us a Poirot who’s fussy but not too fussy, and rather crisp in his English-language diction. Most radically, this is a Poirot with heart. This interpretation is a dumb idea, but Mr. Branagh, an actor of prodigious skills, can at least pull this one half off. It’s not the only dumb idea in this film, which nevertheless bounces along in a way that’s sometimes almost entertaining.Mr. Branagh shot the film in the 65-millimeter format, which offers a particular kind of “big movie” resolution. People tend to think that big-gauge celluloid is best for big-vista movies, such as “Lawrence of Arabia,” but Mr. Branagh’s picture is set almost entirely on a train. It is a very opulent train, and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings, and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots, Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly, however. He has the train stall on a cliff-side rail, supported by elaborate scaffolding on which he stages a foot chase.

Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and newer faces like Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr., fill out the roster of subjects. Johnny Depp, who is known to make some eccentric choices in crafting his characters, does not (necessarily) disappoint in the role of the murder victim, Edward Ratchett. Imbuing that unsavory character with the dopiest of gangster mannerisms, Mr. Depp may remind you of Matt LeBlanc’s “Friends” character, Joey Tribbiani.

And now, somewhere between the two, lies “Hello Again,” Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusa’s 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). What most distinguishes “Hello Again” from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.“Hello Again” largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades. (Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her. And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on. The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame. A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret. Their scenes together are worth the price of admission.The movie benefits from Austin Schmidt’s neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeone’s lush production design. But Mr. LaChiusa’s songs largely fail to resonate here. Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes. And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson (“Were the World Mine”). The movie musical needs more ambitious creators like him.","Shelley Long, Judith Ivey, Gabriel Byrne, Corbin Bernsen",N/A,USA,Frank Perry,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy",English,N/A,A suburban housewife chokes to death and is brought back to life by a spell cast by her wacky sister.,PG,Touchstone Pictures,"[{'Value': '5.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",06 Nov 1987,96 min,Hello Again,Susan Isaacs,1987,5.1,"2,503","[{'Value': '5.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '11%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}]",hello again,,,,,,,,,

Barely eking out a living — babysitting two indulged Manhattan brats, and working part-time in a chicken costume to promote a restaurant — Luciana is desperate to pay her rent in Brooklyn. She increasingly despairs of ever finding a path to financial security and personal fulfillment.Her Russian friend Olga (a vivid Natasha Romanova), an ardent believer in the promise of American opportunity, suggests an answer. She invites Luciana to attend a fancy “party” in a Chelsea basement, one that will pay Luciana well for her presence. What Luciana enters is a nightmare rabbit hole of objectification and physical peril for the amusement of wealthy New Yorkers. And we discover what is to become of the women who appear in the opening sequence.Ms. Asensio paints a Manhattan populated by threatening hoodlums, demanding roommates, indifferent doctors and scheming merchants. Greatly aided by her cinematographer, Noah Greenberg (shooting in Super 16 millimeter), and her sound designer, Jeffery Alan Jones, she uses restless tracking shots, hectic cityscapes, ambient noise and sequences of prolonged stillness to conjure unease and dread.

72,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-12-02 17:44:01,LBJ,Review: ‘LBJ’ Hides Its Light Under a Bushel of Makeup,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/lbj-review-woody-harrelson-rob-reiner.html,2017-11-03,2017-11-02,"Woody Harrelson swaggers through this movie, which tries to track the coming into consciousness of Lyndon B. Johnson.","From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into “LBJ,” you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character. It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments — Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins — when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior.","Woody Harrelson, Michael Stahl-David, Richard Jenkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh","$2,359,952",USA,Rob Reiner,"Biography, Drama",English,54,"Lyndon B.

It does not apply, however, to Satya de la Manitou, the self-described “right-hand man” to the actor and filmmaker Dennis Hopper for over 40 years and the onscreen narrator of “Along for the Ride.” His reverence for his friend infuses this documentary, shot in somber, stately black and white (except for color clips).He interviews many of Hopper’s friends and associates, including the art dealer Tony Shafrazi and the actor and filmmaker Dean Stockwell, with whom Hopper so memorably appeared in David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet.”Mr. de la Manitou met Hopper in New Mexico when he was flush with the success of “Easy Rider” (1969) and had persuaded Universal Pictures to fund a metafictional art film called “The Last Movie.” The editing of that movie, in Taos, became the subject of its own documentary, “The American Dreamer” (1971), which seems to depict Mr. Hopper going mad. “The Last Movie,” as hermetically brilliant as it is indulgent, was a huge commercial failure that resulted in Mr. Hopper’s near-exile from Hollywood. Mr. de la Manitou followed.“Along for the Ride,” directed by Nick Ebeling, does not ignore Hopper’s wild side. Mr. de la Manitou tells of Hopper alienating Taos locals and sassing cops in bars as if these were heroic acts. But Hopper here is an artist as tortured as he was torturing, as if the director is trying to redress some imbalance.As moving as Mr. de la Manitou’s testimony sometimes is, this movie too often feels like a credulity-straining attempt at hagiography.","Julie Adams, Damon Albarn, Fred C.

I recall a guy who, on the one hand, had facial hair before anybody else in his class and, on the other, wore a slide rule attached to his belt. I wonder what happened to him.In “My Friend Dahmer,” written and directed by Marc Meyers and adapted from a graphic novel memoir by Derf Backderf, that one kid is, yes, Jeffrey Dahmer, who shortly after completing his studies at an Ohio high school began his career as a sex offender, serial killer and cannibal. In this account, the teenage Dahmer is a withdrawn fellow who dissolves roadkill in acid in a shed behind his house and indulges in attention-getting classroom antics. For these he is adopted, in a sense, by three other nerds. Their mischief-making alternates with sometimes grisly scenes in which Dahmer contends with emerging obsessions. When a disturbed schoolmate cuts open his palm and drinks the blood, the others disperse, but Dahmer stands staring, transfixed.This film is sensitively wrought. It’s credible in its evocation of mid-’70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul. But in abandoning the subjective perspective of the graphic novel, “My Friend Dahmer” feels a little lacking in purpose.","Zachary Davis Brown, Lily Kozub, Ross Lynch, Vincent Kartheiser","$1,306,946",USA,Marc Meyers,"Biography, Drama, Horror",English,68,A young Jeffrey Dahmer struggles to belong in high school.,R,FilmRise,"[{'Value': '6.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Jun 2018,107 min,My Friend Dahmer,"Marc Meyers, John Backderf (based on the book My Friend Dahmer by)",2017,6.3,"7,367","[{'Value': '6.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '85%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '68/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",my friend dahmer,,,,,,,,,

But despite signs of progress, the film never happened. Mr. Crowley was found dead in January 2015, along with his wife and daughter, in what police concluded was a double homicide and suicide: He had shot his family and then himself. Perhaps because Mr. Crowley was drawn to the paranoid fringe (he is shown meeting and watching Alex Jones), the deaths became a cause for conspiracy theorists.The documentary’s director, Erik Nelson (a producer on “Grizzly Man”), explores the disjunction between the charismatic filmmaker-to-be with a penchant for both self-promotion and self-documentation and a man who was, it eventually seems clear, descending into mental illness. In one scene that captures the apparent duality of Mr. Crowley, the movie features an interview with two entertainment executives who speak enthusiastically about a meeting with him. Mr. Nelson then shows them as they listen to audio recorded beforehand in which Mr. Crowley describes plans to manipulate them.There’s a morbid fascination inherent to documentaries like “A Gray State,” which is engrossing for the reasons it’s also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour, a friend of Mr. Crowley’s, says, it’s a mystery that answers all the major questions except “Why?”","Barry Drones, Mason Hendricks, Danny August Mason, Chris Peck",N/A,USA,Erik Nelson,Documentary,English,74,"A documentary about the mysterious death of fringe political filmmaker David Crowley, who was found dead alongside members of his family in their suburban Minnesota home in January of 2015.",TV-MA,First Run Features,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",03 Nov 2017,93 min,A Gray State,N/A,2017,6.2,748,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '100%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '74/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",a gray state,,,,,,,,,

That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” and later for many years on “Hollywood Squares.” In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her — and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.","Perry Botkin Jr., Deacon Conroy, Tim Conway, Dan Harmon",N/A,USA,Jason Wise,"Documentary, Comedy",English,70,"Rose Marie, the untold story of fame, love, tragedy and 90 years of American entertainment through the eyes of the woman who did it all.",N/A,Samuel Goldwyn Films,"[{'Value': '8.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",02 Nov 2017,85 min,Wait for Your Laugh,"Christina Tucker, Jason Wise",2017,8.3,192,"[{'Value': '8.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '89%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '70/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",wait for your laugh,,,,,,,,,

(To the writers and directors, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, they’re apparently the same thing.) Adding an extra schmear of bad mothers, the plot finds our three originals (Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Ms. Hahn) buckling under the stress of Christmas and appalled when their own mothers (played by Ms. Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) show up for the holiday.The new arrivals, complete with a single neurosis apiece — the grifter, the clinger, the perfectionist — infantilize and infuriate their daughters, who vow to “take back Christmas.” This rebellion, staged in raucous montages in a mall and elsewhere, involves getting plastered at the food court, terrorizing Santa with cleavage and assaulting strangers and one another. Worst of all is an extended sequence where Ms. Hahn’s character gives a Brazilian wax to a prodigiously endowed male client, who verbally guides us from stem to stern with disgusting specificity. At the same time, the movie’s presumably normally gifted men are as superfluous to the proceedings as a thesaurus in the writers’ room.Set in a suburban nightmare of oppressive expectations, “A Bad Moms Christmas” ends with its own sequel already cued up.“I have heart cancer,” Ms. Hines’s character says at one point in a vain attempt to halt her daughter’s complaints.

Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds — the physical ones, anyway — heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miike’s “Blade of the Immortal.”Adding a soupçon of sorcery to the genre’s typical vengeance saga, Manji’s immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishi’s screenplay. (As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly — like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed. And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents. But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a “True Grit” connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.It’s also one of the most bonkers. Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry — like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides — and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents. These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal who’s 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves. (A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)Though not nearly as mindful or meaty as Mr. Miike’s 2011 triumph, “13 Assassins,” “Blade” is creatively gory fun. Overlong and over-the-top, the brutality finally becomes repetitive and somewhat deadening; but Mr. Miike has learned a few tricks from his many previous movies, like allowing the camera to sit still and capture the eerie silence that follows a massacre.That stillness is a trademark of Anotsu (Sota Fukushi, terrific), the story’s big bad and also its most beautiful. Languid and slender, with an androgynous pout and a fondness for palest turquoise, the soft-voiced Anotsu leads his renegade army primarily by standing and posing.

Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night.The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere.We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring.Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen.Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled.

Their city only complicates matters.","Michelle Morgan’s “It Happened in L.A.” is an ensemble comedy aspiring to wordy Woody Allen sophistication but lacking serious political or satirical bite. And yet, glimmers of promise abound.Ms. Morgan plays Annette, an unrealized Type A writer living with the milquetoast Elliot (Jorma Taccone), a writer-director on a “Game of Thrones”-like TV show. Their friend Baker (Dree Hemingway), an interior designer who pines for marriage but sleeps with men too quickly, pursues a loveless affair with a married man (Tate Donovan). When Annette and Elliot separate because of Annette’s restlessness, she canoodles with a disheveled dilettante (Robert Schwartzman). As for Baker, her cousin (Kentucker Audley) promises to hook her up with a colleague.In Annette, Ms. Morgan (who wrote the Kristen Wiig vehicle “Girl Most Likely”) gives herself the smart, loquacious and caustic role, while Ms. Hemingway (“Starlet”) plays the needier, less intellectual of the two. Amid peppery dialogue and solid production values, the movie acknowledges show-business absurdities (green-screen emoting, the seeming ubiquity of people hawking their own scripts) with rueful affection. But the film stoops to using a prostitute (Margarita Levieva) — yes, she proves to have a heart of gold — to validate Elliot’s virility.As a screenwriter, Ms. Morgan is nimble with glib conversation, and she is fearless at playing an often unlikable character. But this movie might only narrowly pass the Bechdel test, and mustering sympathy for Annette’s affluent, insular circle is difficult. The plot resolutions ultimately feel pat, and the conflicts, in retrospect, thin. You sense that Ms. Morgan can deliver harder punches. Maybe someday she will.","Michelle Morgan, Jorma Taccone, Dree Hemingway, Kentucker Audley",N/A,USA,Michelle Morgan,Comedy,English,58,"In this classically styled comedy of manners set in Los Angeles, sophisticated thirtysomethings try to determine whether ideal happiness exists in coupledom or if the perfectly suited couple is actually just an urban myth.",N/A,Hyperion Media Group,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",03 Nov 2017,97 min,It Happened in L.A.,Michelle Morgan,2017,6.2,72,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '67%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '58/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",it happened in l.a.,,,,,,,,,

But that was old news in Mexico, where months earlier a similar showdown had played out.After almost two years, two gay men were finally issued the marriage license they were legally entitled to in Mexicali, the capital of the northern Mexico state of Baja California. “No Dress Code Required” documents the obstacles that couple, Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Victor Fernando Urias Amparo, who goes by Fernando, confronted to reach their goal — and the public support that saw to it they would.As early as 2010, Mexico’s highest court upheld same-sex marriages, yet local compliance varied widely. Citing religious grounds, the Mexicali mayor and Baja California governor made no secret of their opposition. In the film, Victor and Fernando are repeatedly rebuffed; municipal officials challenge their birth certificates, and investigate a claim they are mentally ill. Three wedding dates are scheduled, then postponed. At one, authorities say a bomb threat is closing City Hall.Publicly, the men remain amused; privately, they grow increasingly politicized. Asked if he knew what he was getting into, Victor says, “I didn’t understand. I had to change my attitude so people would respect me.” As they become a media cause célèbre, though, the bureaucrats eventually relent.Cristina Herrera Borquez’s film limits its point of view to Victor and Fernando’s, and doesn’t delve into the opposition or examine the backstage maneuverings. When, as a public demonstration grows, the men are suddenly asked into the mayor’s office, no cameras follow. But they get their license, and “No Dress Code Required” chronicles the grudging advance of cultural change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-12-02 17:44:01,Last Flag Flying,"Review: ‘Last Flag Flying’ Is a Starry, Somber and Comic War Movie",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/last-flag-flying-review-steve-carell-bryan-cranston-laurence-fishburne-richard-linklater.html,2017-11-03,2017-11-02,"Three Vietnam vets — played by Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne — reunite during the Iraq war to accomplish a grim mission.","Richard Linklater is one of the great listeners in American movies. At his best — most canonically in the “Before” trilogy but also in films like “Slacker,” “Dazed and Confused” and “Waking Life” — he quiets the engine of plot, keeps the camera at a polite, attentive distance and lets people talk. The content of the conversations is important, but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words.“Last Flag Flying,” Mr. Linklater’s new feature, is a suite for three voices. It’s a lot of other things, too. A war movie, in its way, and also a road picture and a memory play. Set in 2003, at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished, it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines. Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) — his nickname was Doc — served in the Navy. Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie, and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war.Back then, Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge — he mordantly calls it a “better career decision” — a fact that connects “Last Flag Flying” to an earlier work, Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” That movie, released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young, was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklater’s film. (Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)“Last Flag Flying” is not a literal continuation of “The Last Detail.” The names of the men and the details of their shared back story have been changed. A petty theft has been replaced by something grimmer and more specifically tied to Vietnam. But the new movie echoes its predecessor in shape and to some degree in mood. The three men make their way up the Eastern Seaboard, mostly by train, toward Portsmouth, N.H., stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery.Portsmouth is where Doc did his time, and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey. The young man, who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school, died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush. Doc has sought out his old buddies — though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities — to help bring his boy home. He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery, a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored. A member of the son’s company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men.“Last Flag Flying” often plays less like a tragedy than a low-key comedy in a tragic frame. Doc, Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes. Doc, younger than the other two — he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together — is the quietest, a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief. Sal is the wild man, a motor mouth whose high spirits, you feel, could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye. Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past, sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family.The three have a lot to talk about, and they also leave a lot unsaid. Mr. Linklater avoids flashbacks and other obvious ways of connecting the film’s present to its implied past. We don’t see any combat, either in Iraq or Vietnam, which gives the verbal accounts of what happened in those places extra weight and mystery. There is some political venting — none of which fits in a tidy ideological box — but mostly a lot of bluster, chops-busting and reminiscing to pass the time.The time doesn’t always pass easily, though. The film, like the characters, feels like it’s working things out as it goes along. This is sometimes fascinating and sometimes frustrating. The performances don’t always connect. Mr. Cranston, leaning into a New York accent, his hands and face perpetually in motion, has the busy energy of a stage actor. Mr. Fishburne is a master of stillness, and the dissonance between them isn’t just a matter of the differences between Sal and Mueller. I never made the imaginative leap from performance to reality. The actors somehow got in the way of the characters.But even if “Last Flag Flying” isn’t quite persuasive, it is nonetheless enormously thought-provoking, and its roughness is a sign of how earnestly it grapples with matters that other movies about war prefer not to think about. It is about the much-discussed division between members of the military and the rest of society, and also about the less frequently acknowledged conflicts within and among those who fight. It uses the language of heroism and sacrifice to challenge popular, sentimental notions of what those things mean, and to connect individual ethics with collective morality. None of that is easy, and what may be hardest to bear is the awareness that a country can sometimes look smaller than the people who serve it.","Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne, Steve Carell, J.

83,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-12-01 17:44:02,Thor: Ragnarok,"Review: ‘Thor: Ragnarok,’ of Gods, Monsters and Silly Jokes",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/movies/thor-ragnarok-review-chris-hemsworth.html,2017-11-03,2017-11-01,"In the newest, loosest, goofiest and funniest Thor blowout, Chris Hemsworth’s superhero chillaxes with the Hulk and takes a punch from a Valkyrie.","There’s a nice bit in “Thor: Ragnarok,” the latest Marvel blowout to feature the god of thunder, where he tries to start a jet using a voice-activated password. He needs to make a getaway — he’s neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements — so identifies himself as the “strongest Avenger.” No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies, Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he’d copped to being the “most boring Avenger.”Through no fault of their likable star, Chris Hemsworth, the Thor movies have been largely forgettable, memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor’s former love interest, now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). “Ragnarok” tries hard to change that profile, and mostly succeeds by knocking its big, blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons, including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history, especially those who look like Aryan cartoons.That isn’t Thor’s fault; he was drawn that way. But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary — and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while. Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He’s a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth. For much of “Ragnarok,” he’s a playfully sustained joke.As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople”) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There’s a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor’s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin’s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok — kill, strut, repeat — and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it’s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lamé and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci’s host in “The Hunger Games.”The Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi’s handling of the material. It’s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture’s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It’s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who’s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulk’s inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in “Ragnarok” than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi’s truest achievement here. For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery.That scene is a jolt, because it’s a reminder of the narrative ambition and mythic grandeur that’s often reduced in this franchise to epic fights, fancy elocution and special effects. It’s amusing how “Ragnarok” humanizes Thor, yet in doing so it dilutes his Thorness, the essential qualities that make him more than a dude with a cool hammer. And the more familiar and less godlike he becomes, the more evident it is that this series has never figured out how to make his myth fit with the modern world. So it’s made Thor a fish out of water and a recurrent punch line. Now, though, with Thor (and Mr. Hemsworth) at last settled in, what he needs is a myth as mighty as his shtick.","Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba","$314,971,245","USA, Australia",Taika Waititi,"Action, Adventure, Comedy",English,74,"Thor is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarök, the destruction of his world, at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain Hela.",PG-13,Walt Disney Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",03 Nov 2017,130 min,Thor: Ragnarok,"Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, Christopher L.

SCOTT,1,2017-12-01 17:44:02,Lady Bird,Review: Greta Gerwig’s ‘Lady Bird’ Is Big-Screen Perfection,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/movies/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan.html,2017-11-03,2017-10-31,"Saoirse Ronan plays a high school senior who insists on asserting her individuality, and it makes for a thrilling film.","Christine McPherson, who prefers to be called Lady Bird — it’s her given name, she insists, in the sense that “it’s given to me, by me” — is a senior at a Catholic girls’ high school. Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), the principal, has read Lady Bird’s college application essay. “It’s clear how much you love Sacramento,” Sister Sarah remarks. This comes as a surprise, both to Lady Bird and the viewer, who is by now aware of Lady Bird’s frustration with her hometown.“I guess I pay attention,” she says, not wanting to be contrary.“Don’t you think they’re the same thing?” the wise sister asks.The idea that attention is a form of love (and vice versa) is a beautiful insight, and in many ways it’s the key to “Lady Bird,” Greta Gerwig’s beautiful, insightful new film, the first for which she is solely credited as writer and director. Ms. Gerwig, a Sacramento native and member of her heroine’s generation — the movie takes place mostly during the 2002-3 academic year — knows her characters and their world very well. Her affection envelops them like a secular form of grace: not uncritically, but unconditionally. And if you pay the right kind of attention to “Lady Bird” — absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, its choral passages along with its solos and duets — you will almost certainly love it. It’s hard not to.Lady Bird herself may be a bit more of a challenge. Played with daunting, dauntless precision by Saoirse Ronan (already, at 23, one of the most formidable actors in movies today), Lady Bird can give herself and everyone around her a hard time. Not because she is especially reckless or troubled — “Lady Bird” is the farthest thing from a melodrama of youth gone wild — but because she insists on asserting her own individuality, even when she’s not quite sure what that means.She tackles the practical and spiritual project of becoming who she is with the mixture of self-assurance and insecurity common to adolescents of a certain sensitive kind. She is idealistic and hypocritical; self-centered and generous; a rebel and a conformist; an enthusiast and a skeptic. A typical American teenager, but also — and therefore — a unique bundle of contradictory and confusing impulses.“I want you to be the very best version of yourself,” says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I’m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.I’ll settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself. In life, that’s a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies. Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, “Lady Bird” is.","Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges","$48,285,330",USA,Greta Gerwig,"Comedy, Drama","English, Spanish",94,"In 2002, an artistically inclined seventeen-year-old girl comes of age in Sacramento, California.",R,A24,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Dec 2017,94 min,Lady Bird,Greta Gerwig,2017,7.5,"148,271","[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '99%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '94/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",lady bird,Lady Bird,A24,387940.0,-32.0,392.0,990.0,31432463.0,59.0,17531.0

Thompson.,"When we meet Bonnie, a young architect in Brooklyn, she’s on her way to a well-deserved night out. Bonnie drinks and dances, swatting away a few overeager hands. After turning down her friend’s offer to split a cab, she stumbles toward home. Bonnie puts on her headphones, she’s in her own world. And then Bonnie is pulled into an alleyway, where she is brutally raped by a stranger.The rape is an early turning point in “The Light Of The Moon” and what follows are the aftereffects of this violation. Charismatically played by Stephanie Beatriz of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” Bonnie walks us through the bureaucratic process of victimhood — having a rape kit administered, going to the police station to identify suspects, and meeting with lawyers to discuss the likelihood of arrests. But Bonnie also experiences the emotional consequences of rape. She’s angry at her boyfriend, Matt (Michael Stahl-David) for changing his behavior as he tries to care for her, but Bonnie changes too. She’s moody, she’s secretive, her work suffers, and she can’t have sex without thinking of the attack.No matter how low Bonnie’s spirits sink, the film’s writer and director, Jessica M. Thompson, holds her star up to the light. With colorful sets and bright cinematography to match its lucid emotional logic, “The Light of the Moon” is a realistic exercise in psychological clarity. For viewers whose experiences mirror Bonnie’s or Matt’s, this therapeutically minded movie might remind them of past anxieties, but as a resource for those looking to understand the process of recovery, it’s hard to imagine a more comprehensive or sympathetic look at the challenge of surviving.","Stephanie Beatriz, Michael Stahl-David, Conrad Ricamora, Catherine Curtin",N/A,USA,Jessica M.

The stationmaster bicycles ahead of them to issue a warning at the watering hole; the residents begin to whisper. It’s the wedding day of the son of the town clerk, who doesn’t want any trouble with elections coming up. The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fiancé is still hovering.Ferenc Torok’s lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, “1945,” shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon. The visiting men in black hats — a father (Ivan Angelus) and his adult son (Marcell Nagy) — aren’t villains out for revenge, but Orthodox Jews, who have come to the village at the end of the war. They are transporting trunks said to be filled with perfume or cosmetics. The purpose of their journey is obscure.The two barely speak over the course of the film; the guilty villagers talk among themselves. “We have to give it all back,” the town drunk (Jozsef Szarvas) tells the clerk, Istvan (Peter Rudolf), believing that the strangers have a connection to the town’s deported Jews. Dismissing the concern, Istvan nevertheless understands that fear; he played a pivotal role in betraying the local Jews, a sin for which his opiate-addicted wife (Eszter Nagy-Kalozy) holds him in contempt. As the film slowly reveals how the village’s veneer of civility is built over a foundation of treachery, the darkened foregrounds suggest conspirators hiding in plain sight.Absorbing and finely wrought, “1945” is not perfect. It oversimplifies Istvan’s motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend. The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric, especially when it riffs on Max Bruch’s widely used composition for Kol Nidre, a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context. And by design, the movie is something of a tease, more interested in setup than in payoff. The guilt that eats at these characters resists easy closure or absolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,GLENN KENNY,0,2017-11-10 17:44:01,Frank Serpico,Review: ‘Frank Serpico’ Updates the Story of the Man Behind a Classic Movie,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/movies/frank-serpico-review.html,2017-11-01,2017-10-31,The real Frank Serpico proves to be a compelling figure in a documentary that picks up where the classic Hollywood film left off.,"This movie’s intention is in its title. The documentary “Frank Serpico” fills out an American classic that is now almost 45 years old. “Serpico,” the 1973 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino, was an adaptation of a book by Peter Maas about a New York City police officer who fought corruption in the ranks and got, among other things, a bullet in the head for his trouble. The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino D’Ambrosio, the movie lights up. “I told myself I was an actor,” he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests. He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his father’s shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience. Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying. Next time, Frank’s father demanded payment upfront. “The cop never came into the store again,” Mr. Serpico says. “Although he had the shield of the law, he demeaned it by his actions.”Mr. Serpico joined the force in 1959 and, witnessing casual payoffs that were accepted without a thought, encountered further disappointment: “The job was not on the level.”The star of the movie is a compelling figure, and Mr. D’Ambrosio presents quite a few people from Mr. Serpico’s past who have a similar draw. But the director’s filmmaking instincts are not always salutary. He introduces each new interviewee with a shot of the subject standing, looking into the camera for several seconds. This affectation grows wearying. The actor John Turturro is not an uninteresting subject, but watching him talk about his reaction to the Lumet-Pacino movie, you get the feeling he is only there because Mr. D’Ambrosio could not secure an on-camera interview with Mr. Pacino.The movie does feature a sit-down between Mr. Serpico and Arthur Cesare, his partner in the narcotics division, who was present the night Mr. Serpico was shot. He tells Mr. Cesare that he considers it peculiar that no 10-13, or “officer in need of assistance,” call went out on his behalf. But there’s no combustion in the confrontation, and the exchange goes limp. Could Mr. Cesare have called it in, and if so, why didn’t he? Like much else in the movie, it’s frustrating.","Frank Serpico, Stanislao Pugliese, Janet Panetta, John O'Connor",N/A,USA,Antonino D'Ambrosio,Documentary,English,68,"In his own words, Frank Serpico tells the story of his one-man crusade for police reform in the NYPD during the early 1970s.",N/A,N/A,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Nov 2017,98 min,Frank Serpico,"Antonino D'Ambrosio, Antonino D'Ambrosio",2017,6.7,112,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '68/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",frank serpico,,,,,,,,,
88,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-17 17:44:01,Suburbicon,Review: Glib Laughs and Race Hate in ‘Suburbicon’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/suburbicon-review-george-clooney-matt-damon-julianne-moore.html,2017-10-27,2017-10-26,"George Clooney stays off camera to direct Matt Damon and Julianne Moore in a caustic comedy about the good old American days of fear, hate and rage.","“Suburbicon,” a jaundiced, hard-sell comedy, wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock. This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren’t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn’t quite as balanced as it seems. Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word. Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couple’s son, Andy.Still, the families are further aligned when, shortly after the Mayerses move in, two thugs invade the Lodge home. Except instead of simply robbing the family, they kill someone, violence that shifts the story’s focus to the Lodges. It’s a lurching turn as well as a missed opportunity. The story of the Mayers family is grounded in the history that clearly appeals to Mr. Clooney — it’s based on events that took place in Levittown, Pa., in 1957 — but what happens to the Lodges plays like one of the Coens’ signature Looney Tunes as written by James M. Cain. By the time Oscar Isaac swoops in with a fedora and a wolfish grin, the movie has become a bludgeoning pastiche.Mr. Clooney gets some things right in “Suburbicon,” including visually and with his two appealing child actors, who together give the movie a heartbeat. As the story grows grimmer and pulpier, he plays with different registers of realism, deepens the shadows and narrows his focus, using tight close-ups and all the wood paneling to box the characters in. But he skimps on the adult characters’ inner lives, and, once the narrative weight shifts to the Lodges, he never finds the tone that balances the movie’s sincerity with its nihilism. One problem is that Mr. Clooney seems to believe in happy endings, however hard-earned, while the Coens — whose presence hovers throughout — are the kind of pessimists who laugh in the dark. The tones and worldviews don’t jibe.The greater, graver flaw, though, the one that empties “Suburbicon” out and turns it into a mannerist exercise, is that the movie reproduces the inequality it’s ostensibly outraged by. This has less to do with star power and everything to do with emphasis and interest. It’s clear even from her few scenes, including a showdown with a racist, that Ms. Westbrook could have made Mrs. Mayers a force if given the chance. Yet despite the parallel editing, despite the scenes of the mob plaguing the Mayerses — and the images of a black mother, father and son who are sometimes seen but say so little — their terror isn’t about them. It’s about how bad it makes white people look.","Steve Monroe, Gavin Wilde, Landon Gordon, Hope Banks",N/A,"UK, USA",George Clooney,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",English,42,"As a 1950s suburban community self-destructs, a home invasion has sinister consequences for one seemingly normal family.",R,N/A,"[{'Value': '5.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",27 Oct 2017,105 min,Suburbicon,"Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, George Clooney, Grant Heslov",2017,5.6,"25,318","[{'Value': '5.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '42/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",suburbicon,Suburbicon,Paramount Pictures,6772.0,-35.0,281.0,24.0,5775178.0,21.0,17486.0

Maya, a renowned poet living in isolation, believes her work has begun to decline. Her only concern now is with finding a worthy heir to manage her estate. Women need not apply — Maya wants to play with power and toy with the young male poets who offer themselves as her potential successors.The passions that drive “Maya Dardel,” written and directed by Magdalena Zyzak and Zachary Cotler, are more literary than cinematic. Maya circles her legacy-minded suitors, dropping references to Sylvia Plath and discussing the merits of rhyme schemes and suicide. But for all the linguistic gymnastics, the film is hamstrung by its directors’ lack of visual imagination. Maya challenges her boyish applicants poetically, sexually and finally with offers of intimacy, but the editing all too often settles into a submissive back and forth. During Maya’s tête-à-têtes, we get a glimpse of her home, but every room in her mountainside hideaway has the same sickly hues of blue and green. What little light makes it through appears weak and suffocated, and though the claustrophobia abates when she walks through the California brambles, even nature isn’t immune to the enervating pallor of Ms. Zyzak and Mr. Cotler’s compositions.The red-blooded vivacity of Ms. Olin’s performance, however, pierces through the muck. She chews feeble lines like meat, spitting out the masticated remains. For all of Maya’s talk of finding the youthful Actaeon to her Artemis, the only time Ms. Olin appears matched is in her brief scenes with her neighbor, Leonora, played by the equally strong Rosanna Arquette.","Lena Olin, Alexander Koch, Nathan Keyes, Jordan Gavaris",N/A,"Poland, USA","Zachary Cotler, Magdalena Zyzak",Drama,English,53,"A famous writer announces that she intends to end her life and male writers may compete to become executor of her estate.

Kevin Tent, Alexander Payne’s longtime editor, has worked on some of that director’s funniest movies, including “Sideways” and the forthcoming “Downsizing.” Yet Mr. Tent’s directorial debut, “Crash Pad,” indicates this artist has more to learn about his new craft.“Crash Pad” follows a millennial slacker and self-professed romantic, Stensland (Domhnall Gleeson), in the depths of heartbreak after the end of his fling with a married woman, Morgan (Christina Applegate). After binge-watching episodes of “Dawson’s Creek” and trying to blackmail his former flame, Stensland receives an unusual proposal from Morgan’s husband, Grady (Thomas Haden Church from “Sideways”). The two men become roommates in a bid to make Morgan jealous while they mend their bruised feelings with women and cheap tequila.The movie’s premise isn’t as bad as the forced, unnatural dialogue. Even the reliable Ms. Applegate and Mr. Church can’t salvage the screenwriter Jeremy Catalino’s clumsy lines. “Morgan’s faithlessness has emboldened me to take a vacation,” Grady declares when moving into Stensland’s apartment. Saddled with the wordiest scenes in the movie, Mr. Gleeson comes across like a college freshman fumbling through his first Shakespeare play.Stensland and Grady’s romantic plight might have earned more sympathy if their characters weren’t so insufferable. While Mr. Tent’s direction is serviceable, it’s safe. His movie lacks any stylish risks that would make this trio’s bad romance memorable, leaving “Crash Pad” to feel like a warm-up act.","Domhnall Gleeson, Christina Applegate, Sunita Prasad, Balinder Johal",N/A,"Canada, USA",Kevin Tent,Comedy,English,46,"A hopeless romantic, who thinks he's found true love with an older woman, learns that she's married and that the fling is merely an instrument of revenge against her neglectful husband.",R,Vertical Entertainment and Sony Pictures Worldwide,"[{'Value': '5.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",26 Sep 2017,91 min,Crash Pad,Jeremy Catalino,2017,5.6,"1,728","[{'Value': '5.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '54%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '46/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",crash pad,,,,,,,,,

But its courageous subject makes this documentary’s shortcomings easier to overlook.Charles Mully was born in Kenya and abandoned by his family at 6; he later stole and begged on the streets. Through the generosity of strangers, hard work and some prayer, he not only found a job but became wealthy by running several companies, including a bus service and oil and gas ventures.To the surprise of his wife and eight children, Mr. Mully one day decided to give up business and devote his resources to Nairobi’s orphans. He turned his residence into a shelter, moving in dozens of homeless Kenyans (while sending some of his own children away to boarding schools). Later he built an orphanage that has housed and fed thousands; a farm there is dedicated to environmentally friendly agriculture.Scott Haze, the director, is eager to inspire. Interviews show Mr. Mully to be resolute, and his family kindhearted. Yet the film’s tone sometimes turns repetitive. In one short section, a few orphans tell of their lives before meeting Mr. Mully. Their brutal recollections are essential to hear, but Mr. Haze hurriedly retreats from those and other harsh topics. Just as vexing, redundant voice-overs describe what is being shown; while Mr. Mully speaks of events, scripted scenes re-enact them.“Mully” nods toward its subject’s religious faith but refrains from preachiness. Mr. Mully’s actions speak for themselves, and his robust personality makes him a pleasure to listen to. If the film doesn’t always dig deeply into this man’s life, we still see the results of his efforts.

Legally blind since childhood, Gina rarely leaves their home in Bangkok, relying almost entirely on the attentive James. But when a cornea transplant restores vision to one eye, Gina discovers that her life is not quite as she imagined.Nor is she. New erotic interests surface during a trip to Spain, where the hypersexualized marriage of her sister and brother-in-law nudges the film into seamier territory and prompts a change in Gina’s appearance. As James becomes increasingly destabilized by his wife’s transformation, the movie seems keen to linger over what can happen to a relationship when a previously dependent partner gains agency.Instead, we’re hastened toward a nonsensical, almost illegible ending that lays waste to all this careful mood-setting. Ms. Lively is well cast, gracefully patrolling the boundary of her limited range, with Mr. Clarke less steady in the more amorphous role of someone who seems a bit off from the outset. And though the milky visual disruptions that signal Gina’s initially blurry view of the world are overdone, there’s something seductive about her journey that cries out for a filmmaker like Nicolas Roeg. In his hands, the haze of sex and danger that surrounds these two might have been revealed as more than just a tease.","Blake Lively, Jason Clarke, Ahna O'Reilly, Miquel Fernández",N/A,"Thailand, USA",Marc Forster,"Drama, Mystery, Romance",English,43,A blind woman's relationship with her husband changes when she regains her sight and discovers disturbing details about themselves.,R,Open Road Films,"[{'Value': '5.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",27 Oct 2017,109 min,All I See Is You,"Sean Conway (screenplay), Marc Forster (screenplay)",2016,5.3,"5,273","[{'Value': '5.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '29%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '43/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",all i see is you,All I See is You,Open Road,426.0,-19.0,53.0,8.0,217644.0,14.0,17479.0

The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Post’s David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book. Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect. (One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiancée has left him, has been added to the mix.)The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq. He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichés) and young children. He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wife’s friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning. As with Adam, part of Tausolo’s trouble is admitting his problems to himself. The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than “American Sniper” (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones). Instead, “Thank You for Your Service” is a macho weepie, whose message — that wars are permanent for those who fight in them — has broad appeal.That Iraq seems unlikely to produce another “The Best Years of Our Lives” has as much to do with changes in Hollywood craft as with the divisiveness of the war. If, like its characters, “Thank You for Your Service” sometimes struggles to balance staying strong with wearing its heart on its sleeve, it makes an emotional plea in a direct, effective way.","Miles Teller, Beulah Koale, Joe Cole, Scott Haze","$9,437,885","USA, India, Canada",Jason Hall,"Biography, Drama, War",English,68,"A group of U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq struggle to integrate back into family and civilian life, while living with the memory of a war that threatens to destroy them long after they've left the battlefield.",R,Universal Studios,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",27 Oct 2017,109 min,Thank You for Your Service,"David Finkel (Thank You for Your Service by), Jason Hall",2017,6.5,"8,111","[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '76%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '68/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",thank you for your service,Thank You for Your Service,Universal,6085.0,4.0,172.0,35.0,9479390.0,28.0,17493.0

Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging ’60s. (To judge from the film’s grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decade’s tie-dyed palette.)The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the town’s women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself. “The more we push, the more the men do what they want,” she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum. Nora’s days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony. If Nora’s name weren’t enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as “my little bird.”But soon Nora is moved to act. Nora’s rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison. Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law. A small act of defiance against the town’s leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them. Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt.Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, “The Divine Order” doesn’t exactly break new ground. It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy.

The persona she creates on the page is always frank but never ingratiating.So it’s disarming to see a relatively cozy Joan Didion in the documentary “Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,” but it should not be surprising. The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne, one of Ms. Didion’s nephews, who also appears as an onscreen interviewer. The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are, and have been, significant cultural forces. They are also a clan rived by tragedy. Two of Ms. Didion’s most celebrated recent works concern the deaths of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and her daughter, Quintana Roo.The exchanges between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion are at once fond and candid. When Mr. Dunne suggests that his uncle, Ms. Didion’s husband, was a “protector,” Ms. Didion nods animatedly before adding, “And a hothead.”The relationship between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion limits the movie in certain ways, but opens it up in others. Mr. Dunne’s longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule. Ms. Didion’s friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees, and while I’d never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get, I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up.While the movie covers the whole of Ms. Didion’s life (and even the period before it, offering a fun fact that at one point the pioneer Didions traveled with the Donner party), those expecting a thorough examination of Ms. Didion’s work may be disappointed. Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne, a very canny filmmaker, doesn’t accomplish a lot via implication. The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didion’s appreciation of John Wayne, in an early essay, and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a later one. Unlike a great many more facile thinkers, Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures. But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didion’s thinking over the years.Her early writing reveals the instincts of a conservative. As she witnessed the tectonic shifts in American life wrought by, among other things, the counterculture, she admittedly lost faith in “the social contract,” but did not turn left for solutions; rather, she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider. (Two words that are never uttered in this movie are “feminism” and “feminist.”) Mr. Dunne’s movie gets you thinking about all this with extremely well-chosen archival footage and evocative music choices.The movie’s title, like that of Ms. Didion’s collection “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” is derived from the W.B. Yeats poem “The Second Coming.” Mr. Dunne’s portrait and tribute to his aunt, now 82, also reminded me of an observation by D.H. Lawrence: “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically.” Ms. Didion’s triumph, as a writer and a human being, has been to take the age for what it is, to pinpoint how she saw it, and to stick it out.","Hilton Als, Tom Brokaw, Dick Cheney, Jim Didion",N/A,USA,Griffin Dunne,Documentary,English,72,"Literary icon Joan Didion reflects on her remarkable career and personal struggles in this intimate documentary directed by her nephew, Griffin Dunne.",N/A,Netflix,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",27 Oct 2017,94 min,Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,N/A,2017,7.4,833,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '89%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '72/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",joan didion: the center will not hold,,,,,,,,,

Like Johnny (Josh O’Connor), who labors on his struggling family farm in Yorkshire under the critical eyes of his sick father (Ian Hart) and stolid grandmother (Gemma Jones). For relief, he vents his frustrations in binge-drinking and furtive, feral sex with random young men.These taciturn encounters, unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer, suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self. But this bracing, sometimes brutal movie — the feature debut of the writer and director Francis Lee — doesn’t present Johnny’s sexuality as the cause of his self-loathing. Rather, it’s his imprisonment by a legacy he’s not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions.Both are about to be loosened. The arrival of Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a gentle, darkly handsome Romanian migrant worker, softens Johnny’s heart and the movie’s tone. Their passion isn’t pretty, but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors. Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer, the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale.Filmed with a naturalism that recalls Andrea Arnold’s 2012 dive into “Wuthering Heights,” “God’s Own Country” weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards’s biting cinematography and the story’s slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful. Bodily fluids — bestial and human — stain the screen, punctuating a story that’s as much about rediscovering place as finding love. So when Gheorghe looks out at the brooding countryside and murmurs “It’s beautiful here,” we sense that Johnny really doesn’t need persuading.","Josh O'Connor, Gemma Jones, Harry Lister Smith, Ian Hart",N/A,UK,Francis Lee,"Drama, Romance","English, Romanian",85,"Spring.

But of course I don’t have a choice. Mr. Butler’s character, Jake Lawson, has a job to do, and so do I. Jake’s is to fix the space-based weather-control system he designed and built, racing against a digital clock that counts down the minutes until “geostorm.” Mine involves counting the minutes until “Geostorm” is over and then offering a comprehensive damage assessment. To quote something Jake says to a grandstanding senator (Richard Schiff) who dares to question his expertise: you’re welcome.Directed by Dean Devlin from a script he wrote with Paul Guyot and discreetly installed in theaters without advance screenings, “Geostorm” uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the president and secretary of state, while Abbie Cornish is a Secret Service agent secretly keeping company with a deputy secretary named Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who happens to be Jake’s younger brother. The siblings have their differences, but they share an unplaceable American accent, an aversion to regular shaving and a desire not to see the world destroyed by ice, fire, hail or heavy rain.The movie does what it can to replicate those elemental forces. I happened to see it in the 4DX format — a first for me — which combines the thrill of a Mad Tea Party ride with the sensory challenges of a cab ride across the Manhattan Bridge on a rainy night. Your seat rocks and rumbles during chase scenes, lists gently from side to side during zero-gravity interludes and abuses your lumbar spine when space junk starts flying. You sometimes catch a whiff of burning skyscraper, a spray of monsoon mist, a whoosh of gale-force wind and the gentle caress of Mr. Butler’s stubble on your cheek.Not that last thing, actually, but I’m sure they’re working on it. And I look forward to future 4DX adventures, or at least to installing one of those chairs in my office. I wouldn’t say the experience improved “Geostorm,” but it certainly didn’t make it any worse. As for Mr. Butler, he is no more or less credible as a renegade scientific genius than in any other role he’s attempted; consistency is his chief and perhaps his only virtue as an actor.

A Madea Halloween’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/movies/tyler-perrys-boo-2-a-madea-halloween-review.html,2017-10-20,2017-10-20,"In this sequel that feels like a remake, all prospects for amusement are never even vaguely realized.","About a year ago, Tyler Perry’s “Boo! A Madea Halloween” arrived in theaters. It was hardly distinguished, but it had its moments, largely because of the comic interactions between the outrageous, finely aged characters Madea and Joe (both played by Mr. Perry) and their fellow dyspeptic senior citizens, Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis).“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” which, as usual with Mr. Perry’s pictures, wasn’t screened in advance for critics, frequently feels more like a remake than a sequel. The movie revisits Brian Simmons (Mr. Perry), a single dad, and his rebellious teenage daughter, Tiffany (Diamond White). The respect-your-parents and don’t-even-think-about-having-sex lessons of the previous film have long been forgotten by the characters; if anything, Tiffany, now turning 18, is snottier, and Brian more passive. (The movie introduces an ex-wife, played by Taja V. Simpson, who walks all over him and is too permissive with Tiffany.)Once again Tiffany is determined to attend a frat party. And, yes, it’s the same inhabited-by-30-year-olds frat from the first film. The twist this time is the fellas aren’t allowed to have a party in the house, so instead they’re having it at Derrick Lake, which was (cue scary music) the scene of a still-apparently-shrouded-in-mystery (with this shoddy script it’s hard to really tell) mass murder back in the 1970s. Rumor has it some kind of massacre-seeking entity haunts the premises.The prospect of Mr. Perry’s rambunctious Madea possibly taking on a Jason Voorhees-type killer has an amusement value that is not even vaguely realized here. This movie finds Mr. Perry, never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking, drastically off whatever his best game is. Every camera setup is a study in inertia; every other cut is a beat or two behind where a punch line needs to land. To call this movie unwatchable would be inaccurate, though the scenes featuring Mike Tornabene and Yousef Erakat, portraying frat brothers who act as if they are dying to reassemble a group of Dead End Kids for Sidney Kingsley’s play, are pretty painful. On the other hand, the lighting is so weak, “Boo 2!” is quite often close to unseeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,MANOHLA DARGIS,1,2017-11-19 17:44:02,Wonderstruck,"Review: ‘Wonderstruck,’ Todd Haynes’s Imitations of Life",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/wonderstruck-review-todd-haynes.html,2017-10-20,2017-10-19,Mr. Haynes’s lovely adaptation of Brian Selznick’s book centers on a girl in the 1920s and a boy in the ’70s whose lives are mysteriously connected.,"Stars glitter and worlds collide in Todd Haynes’s “Wonderstruck,” a lovely ode to imagination and to the stories that make us who we are. A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.Part of the pleasure of Mr. Haynes’s films — which include “I’m Not There” and “Carol” — is how he deploys intellectual distance as he plays with cinematic form, considers identity and upends clichés. Elsewhere, this can come across as dreary, even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas, his films gather force until, at times with near-violent suddenness, they become devastatingly, skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes’s “Far From Heaven,” his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And, in “Wonderstruck,” a children’s story about finding your place in the world, in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity, desire and imagination.“Wonderstruck” takes a while to find its groove, but it gets there. Mr. Haynes’s oscillation between the story’s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gonçalves), but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That’s particularly true because it’s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben’s half has its attractions, including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it’s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick’s storytelling, with its mysticism and coincidences, creaks the loudest.Mr. Selznick’s emphasis on wonder — represented by the story’s surfeit of enchantments and the near-miraculously fitted parts — can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick’s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes “Wonderstruck” his own because the wonder of the film isn’t in its story but in its telling. It’s in the expressive beauty of his images, the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally, generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life, allowing them to find themselves — in their willfulness, their heartbreaks and their imaginings — so that eventually they can find someone else.","Millicent Simmonds, Julianne Moore, Cory Michael Smith, James Urbaniak","$976,561",USA,Todd Haynes,"Drama, Mystery","Spanish, English",71,"Tells the tale of two children separated by fifty years.

If only Joseph Kosinski’s action-drama “Only the Brave” — based on the exploits of the real-life Granite Mountain Hotshots, a troop of elite firefighters near Prescott, Ariz. — had a less generic title and fewer formulaic beats. But under its slick, schematic surface, this tale of aspiration and redemption at least offers moments of genuine feeling.This is a movie about Southwestern working-class men who drink beer, carry heavy tools, train in quasi-military fashion, banter in a weight room, attend a group family picnic and drive pickup trucks to a soundtrack loaded with AC/DC and ZZ Top. The women in their lives raise children (or train horses) when they’re not scolding their men about neglecting family or the risks of their profession. Amid the familiar milieu, however, there are subtle, inventive touches.The more aspirational narrative concerns Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin, whose craggy face has never better blended with a parched setting). Marsh is determined to whip the Hotshots into an efficient unit, despite challenges from his forthright wife (a vivid Jennifer Connelly, whose impassioned arguments with Mr. Brolin’s character have their own kind of spark). Marsh, a bespectacled Buddhist in recovery from substance abuse, is a fascinating variation on your typical taciturn hero. (As his avuncular mentor, a veteran fire chief, Jeff Bridges embodies a more conventional template.)The redemption concerns a feckless pothead (Miles Teller) whose pregnant girlfriend has left him because of his indigence and dissolution. He must win her back and prove himself a responsible, loving father. The Hotshots help, though he must contend with a ne’er-do-well (Taylor Kitsch) with his own immaturity issues.Mr. Kosinski — and the screenwriters, Ken Nolan (“Black Hawk Down”) and Eric Warren Singer — let the characters grow in complexity before they face their greatest trial. Wisely, they do not overly sentimentalize the conclusion. This may not be a story of triumph, but it’s inspiring nevertheless.","Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Connelly","$18,255,680",USA,Joseph Kosinski,"Biography, Drama",English,72,"Based on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a group of elite firefighters who risk everything to protect a town from a historic wildfire.",PG-13,Columbia Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",20 Oct 2017,134 min,Only the Brave,"Sean Flynn (based on the GQ article ""No Exit"" by), Ken Nolan, Eric Warren Singer",2017,7.7,"35,940","[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '87%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '72/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",only the brave,Only the Brave,Sony Pictures,9765.0,-46.0,86.0,114.0,18181288.0,73.0,17531.0

But the remarkable tale it tells — of a family split up and dispersed to different continents, and the detective work required to figure out what had happened — turns this documentary into a fascinating mystery of reshuffled identities. In this time of mass displacement across the globe, it is a stark reminder of how traumatic the refugee experience often is.At 3, Izak Szewelewicz was sent by his mother, Aida, to Israel from Bergen-Belsen to be raised by foster parents. “It was the best I could do,” she says simply when interviewed. Aida herself immigrated to Canada and would visit Izak on rare occasions. But she never told him that he had a younger brother, or that his father had taken the brother but that she didn’t know where. Izak learned of this when he was 67, in 2013. The Schwarzes, Izak’s nephews, assisted him while filming this unfolding account.With the help of investigators and archives in Europe, Canada and Israel, Izak meets his brother, Shepsel, who is blind and living in Winnipeg. But the teary reunion and Shepsel’s first nervous meeting with Aida are just the start. As Izak and Shepsel try to assemble their family history, questions abound. Friends of Aida recount bits of background she had shared. At 89, though, Aida remains evasive: She doesn’t recall that man with her and the boys in that Bergen-Belsen photo; she’s fuzzy on why she moved to Canada without Shepsel and his father.

102,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-16 17:44:02,The Snowman,Review: ‘The Snowman’ Is a Thrill-Free Thriller Tied in Knots,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/the-snowman-review-michael-fassbender-jo-nesbo.html,2017-10-20,2017-10-19,Michael Fassbender and other talented people wander through this leaden mess.,"There are a couple of mysteries swirling through “The Snowman,” a leaden, clotted, exasperating mess. This ostensible whodunit involves a serial killer who’s preying on women, leaving behind carefully arranged body parts and a childlike snowman as a kind of elaborate signature. The greater puzzle, though, is how an enterprise studded with so much talent — starting with the director Tomas Alfredson (“Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy”) and including the star Michael Fassbender — has led to such a grim, thrill-free thriller, one without a twitch of real feeling and next to no elementary story sense.Mr. Fassbender plays Harry Hole, a dissipated, alcoholic detective living in Oslo, which presumably means he’s Norwegian even if he (and most everyone else) speaks in English. With his red-rimmed eyes and a cigarette drooping from his lips, Harry comes across as one of those classically shabby gumshoe types, the existential inside-outsider who chafes against the rules even as he saves the day. He has an ex (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and a new colleague (Rebecca Ferguson), and soon he has a mess of trouble that he navigates amid a great deal of snow, byzantine developments, dead-end detours and a grab bag of random characters. (Val Kilmer, Chloë Sevigny and Toby Jones all breeze by.)The problem isn’t the narrative complications, even if the movie soon becomes mired in them. Raymond Chandler tied his novel “The Big Sleep” into so many knots that apparently he couldn’t tell who killed one of its characters. As Leigh Brackett, who helped turn the novel into the 1946 film, said, “When you read it from page to page it moves so beautifully that you don’t care.” The problem, Brackett said, was “if you start tearing it apart to see what makes it tick, it comes unglued.” The trick was to hold on to Chandler’s language and go with his flow, mood and milieu, letting — as the film’s director, Howard Hawks, said later — the characters “handle the plot, rather than let the plot move them.”Certainly “The Snowman” might have been better if someone at some point had learned from Hawks (always a good idea) and let the characters handle the plot. That might have helped, at least a little. The movie is based on a novel by the popular Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo, whose intricately involved, atmospheric tales are far more complex — they have politics, themes and worldviews — than anything in this movie.

One, a teenager, Ari, left as his thirst for knowledge came into conflict with religious restrictions. “Wikipedia,” he says, “was a gift from God.” He attends a Christian gathering simply out of curiosity. He also says he has been abused in his past.Another of the three, Luzer, initially seems like the cutup of the bunch, an aspiring actor who lives part-time in Los Angeles and says he had forged his impression of the outside world from furtive movie viewings.

But behind the facade of a self-assured showman is the secret Mr. Turner tries to keep to himself: He’s blind.Mr. Turner, 63, had rebelled in his youth against the grim prognosis that he would one day lose his eyesight. From his love of TV westerns, he learned the sleights of hand used by cardsharps. Then with an obsessive — and sometimes reckless — energy, he made a career as one of the foremost card magicians in his field, performing at the Magic Castle nightclub in Hollywood, at magic conventions and on TV talk shows.As confident as he appears when shuffling a deck of cards, Mr. Turner remains at odds with his blindness. In a few TV appearances, awkward moments arise when the host clumsily refers to Mr. Turner’s disability before he can illustrate his strength as an illusionist. In candid interviews, he’s open about his discomfort around strangers showering him with sympathy and his attempts to hide his blindness in public by refusing to use a cane or a guide dog.Mr. Korem keeps a reverent distance from his subject, as if not to spoil the magic. The director is either too polite or too timid to push Mr. Turner to reveal more details than he’s comfortable sharing. Such a dynamic personality as Mr. Turner’s could use a more dynamic documentary to illuminate it.

Otherwise, this narrative feature debut from Camille Thoman is mostly a frustrating jumble of surreal puzzle pieces that audiences will likely be uninterested in solving.Not that a solution even seems possible. Apparently aiming for an open-ended psychological thriller, Ms. Thoman focuses so fiercely on atmosphere that her narrative isn’t just opaque, it’s a confounding collision of signifiers and symbols. At their center is Miranda (Mireille Enos), an unraveling New York City artist whose work involves invading the privacy of strangers.“You did a bad thing,” her latest victim complains when she builds an exhibit from information purloined from his cellphone. Bad things are something of a habit: When her married lover (Mr. Shepard) sees a violent assault on the street beneath her window, she tells the police — echoing the plot of Curtis Hanson’s 1987 thriller, “The Bedroom Window” — that she was the witness. Stalking a man she recognizes from a police lineup (Goran Visnjic), her behavior grows increasingly paranoid and unhinged. Is she preparing a new art installation, or is someone trying to kill her?If only we cared. Ms. Enos is a credibly fraying voyeur, all anxious looks and nervous starts, but “Never Here” is too emotionally antiseptic to engage. That leaves all the heavy lifting to Sebastian Wintero’s moody, nocturnal cinematography, perfectly paired with James Lavino’s dissonant original score. As Miranda prowls the indigo city streets, bathed in ominous whispers and sharp jabs of neon, you might momentarily forget that the movie around her is a tiny bit bananas.","Mireille Enos, Sam Shepard, Goran Visnjic, Vincent Piazza",N/A,USA,Camille Thoman,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller",English,64,"Disturbing events lead an artist who photographs strangers to suspect that someone out there is watching HER.

In last year’s magical “Swiss Army Man,” he played a gassy, much-manhandled corpse; now he’s embracing the muck and mortifications of “Jungle,” a real-life survival tale from the Australian horror specialist Greg McLean.To play the Israeli adventurer Yossi Ghinsberg, Mr. Radcliffe dives into water and quicksand, slathers himself in fire ants, tangles with a snake and excavates a parasite from his forehead. Given that these torments are very much in his director’s wheelhouse, it’s no surprise that they have an energy the rest of the movie (based on Mr. Ghinsberg’s 2005 memoir) lacks.Yet the look is polished and the setup promising as Yossi heads into the Bolivian jungle with two backpacking pals, an American photographer (Alex Russell) and a Swiss teacher (Joel Jackson). Their guide is Karl (Thomas Kretschmann), a sketchy stranger whose possibly menacing motives cry out for an investigation — fictionalized, if necessary — that never comes. Similarly, Yossi’s friends remain essentially enigmas, generic sidekicks without much to distinguish them beyond degrees of daring and propensity for bickering.Slow to get moving and dramatically slack, “Jungle” cares only about Yossi, whose solo suffering and speed-enhanced hallucinations dominate the narrative. Despite Mr. Radcliffe’s all-too-obvious dedication (his increasingly emaciated body, astonishingly, was not digitally enhanced), he can’t rescue a screenplay (by Justin Monjo) that cares more about the condition of his flesh than the contents of his head.","Daniel Radcliffe, Yasmin Kassim, Luis Jose Lopez, Lily Sullivan",N/A,"Australia, Colombia",Greg McLean,"Action, Adventure, Biography, Drama, Thriller","English, Spanish, German",48,"A group of friends join a guide for a trek into the Bolivian jungle, searching for an Indian village.

108,GLENN KENNY,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,L'enfant secret,Review: The Crushed Romanticism of Philippe Garrel’s ‘L’Enfant Secret’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/movies/lenfant-secret-review-philippe-garrel.html,2017-10-18,2017-10-17,A film that opened in Paris in 1979 finally surfaces in the United States.,"The peculiar dark magic of “L’Enfant Secret,” a 1979 film by Philippe Garrel only now seeing theatrical release in the United States, begins with its models. “Models” was the term the monumental French filmmaker Robert Bresson used for the men and women he cast in his films; he believed acting was an art best reserved for the theater, so he recruited faces and bodies he felt could carry his intents, and instructed them to enact precise physical movements, but not to emote.Mr. Garrel, a filmmaker since his teens, is looser and more expansive in his approach. Nevertheless, in this film he cast two former Bresson “models,” Anne Wiazemsky and Henri de Maublanc, as the lovers Elie and Jean Baptiste. The secret child of the title is, in a sense, the film itself, one in which, according to Mr. Garrel, he “returned to autobiography” after a series of experimental features.But the movie does feature a little boy named Swann who belongs to Elie. The adorable blond moppet, she tells Jean-Baptiste, is the son of a film actor who refuses to acknowledge paternity, even though his mother is raising the child. It reflects Mr. Garrel’s own long love affair with the musical artist Nico, who had a child she said was the son of the French film star Alain Delon. He never acknowledged the boy, but his parents largely raised the child in his early years.Ms. Wiazemsky and Mr. de Maublanc maintain a kind of Bressonian passivity in enacting the dank, entropic spiral that sucks their characters ever downward. They alternately try to maintain, or violently break away from, their intimacy. Mr. Garrel’s approach to narrative here is deliberately provisional; he presents a number of story modules which fragmentedly depict Jean-Baptiste’s mental breakdown, Elie’s mourning over the death of her mother and the couple’s flirtations with potential new lovers and dangerous drugs.Most sad stories of love in our culture express disappointed romanticism. In the world of Mr. Garrel, whose whole work can be seen as an inquiry into the nature of love, romanticism is crushed, slowly and inexorably, yet refuses to die fully. The movie’s few moments of respite from this process are provided through brief shots of the couple walking hand in hand with Swann. Far longer are the shots of them on a park bench in the pouring rain, or sitting on a mattress on an apartment floor, framed by dingy off-white walls.Mr. Garrel’s work has a unique aesthetic that today’s American cinephiles seem to be hungry for; this movie’s long-overdue release here is part of a longer retrospective at the Metrograph. One reason Mr. Garrel’s earlier work has been hard to see in this country is that his early career was more or less as an underground filmmaker — one of the inspirations he cited during a recent New York appearance is Andy Warhol, whom he met through Nico. “L’Enfant Secret” forms a kind of bridge between his more abstract pictures and the narratives of the ’80s and beyond, extending to his latest movie, “Lover for a Day,” which was seen at the New York Film Festival and will have a theatrical run here next year.“L’Enfant Secret” is shot in a black and white that is frequently out of focus, by a camera that’s intentionally not entirely steady. Some shots are reiterated in the ultra-grainy form in which they might have been viewed as rushes, or through a Moviola. Part of Mr. Garrel’s mastery is his ability to make expressive use of what would constitute dire technical flaws in other people’s films. The loose ends, the ragged edges, the awkward cuts: Here they’re like the angry low-fi communication of a postpunk song, desperate in its constricted ability to evoke the ineffable.","Anne Wiazemsky, Henri de Maublanc, Xuan Lindenmeyer, Cécile Le Bailly",N/A,France,Philippe Garrel,Drama,French,N/A,"Four chapters based on the birth of a 'secret child', or a film, with chapter titles: ""La séction Césarienne"" (Caesarian section: a descriptive detail introducing the mother); ""Le dernier ...",N/A,Gerick Films,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",02 Dec 1982,92 min,L'enfant secret,Philippe Garrel,1979,7,177,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",l'enfant secret,,,,,,,,,
109,MANOHLA DARGIS,1,2017-11-03 16:44:01,Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,"Review: ‘Professor Marston,’ With Kinks! Pleasures! Female Power!",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/professor-marston-and-the-wonder-woman-review.html,2017-10-13,2017-10-12,"In “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” the writer-director Angela Robinson tells a knotty story with wit, sympathy and economy.","Suffering Sappho, Batman, you’re such a square! That’s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. “On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,” she says in an early comic while roping another woman, “this is considered the safest method of tying a girl’s arms!”There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, “Professor Marston” tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture — the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.If nothing else, “Professor Marston” is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don’t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. “Are you normal?” he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC — for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance — which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (“D, I, S and C,” the real Marston wrote, “represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.”)Ms. Robinson borrows Marston’s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons’ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.The story of the world’s most famous female superhero, her creators and inspirers, has been told elsewhere, including in Jill Lepore’s book “The Secret History of Wonder Woman.” Ms. Robinson draws on archival sources for her telling and takes some liberties with the historical record, shuffling events around to dovetail with the polymorphous possibilities she’s most interested in. The movie recurrently returns to the 1940s with Marston being grilled by a comic-book skeptic (Connie Britton) about his creation, scenes that fill in some details but also interrupt the fluid narrative flow. These sequences read as a stand-in for the 1950s anti-comic-book crusade of Dr. Fredric Wertham, who condemned Wonder Woman as a “cruel, ‘phallic’ woman.”Dr. Wertham saw cruelty in the Wonder Woman world, but Ms. Robinson sees deep, enduring love in its back story as well as freedom, including from rigid gender roles. Her version of the idealistic professor and his two wonder women, and the complex geometry that defined their relationship, may be a touch fuzzier than the actual story. Certainly the real Marston didn’t have Mr. Evans’s sleek matinee-idol looks. But it’s a pleasurable fantasy, as well as a gentle, appealingly Utopian vision of a world in which men and women can slip from their traditional binds into new, excitingly freeing configurations. Those might be surprising, perhaps even a bit tight around the wrists but, as Ms. Robinson suggests, there are so many possibilities when you’re given room to play.The real Marston was delightfully unbound. In 1937, Ms. Lepore writes in her book, he held a news conference to announce the coming Amazonian rule. The Washington Post ran with the story: “Neglected Amazons to Rule Men in 1,000 Yrs., Says Psychologist.” The Los Angeles Times went with the punchier “Feminine Rule Declared Fact.” “The next 100 years will see the beginning of an American matriarchy,” Mr. Marston said (2037 here we come!). And “in 1,000 years women will definitely rule this country.” Believing women superior, he thought they had twice “the ability for love” as men, which would allow them to conquer the world. It’s a delicious idea although clearly we could use many more lassos.","Luke Evans, Rebecca Hall, Bella Heathcote, Connie Britton","$1,583,641",USA,Angela Robinson,"Biography, Drama",English,68,"The story of psychologist William Moulton Marston, and his polyamorous relationship with his wife and their mistress who would inspire his creation of the superheroine, Wonder Woman.",R,Annapurna Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",13 Oct 2017,108 min,Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,Angela Robinson,2017,7.1,"14,034","[{'Value': '7.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '86%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '68/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",professor marston and the wonder women,,,,,,,,,
110,BEN KENIGSBERG,1,2017-11-07 17:44:01,78/52,Review: Reliving Delicious Terror in ‘78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/78-52-hitchcocks-shower-scene-review.html,2017-10-13,2017-10-12,A documentary by Alexandre O. Philippe finds plenty to examine in one of the most memorable scenes in American film.,"In 2000, the critic Andrew Sarris, one of the original champions of “Psycho,” wrote of how a student had spotted a hidden meaning in Hitchcock’s editing of a scene with Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire). He credited the student with having given him a fresh eye on a film he thought he knew backward and forward.One testament to the infinite richness of Hitchcock’s 1960 masterpiece is that it can sustain a film like Alexandre O. Philippe’s documentary “78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene.” Although “78/52” discusses the significance of “Psycho” as a whole, Mr. Philippe’s movie is primarily devoted to a close reading of just one sequence: the 78 camera setups and 52 edits that yielded the sudden, violent, waterlogged demise of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Even moviegoers who know “Psycho” backward and forward — who consider it a sacred text and who have read Stephen Rebello’s excellent book “Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ‘Psycho’” — are bound to learn something new from the movie, which addresses the shower scene from critical, historical, theoretical and technical angles, down to the blinding white of the bathroom tiles.Many of the original cast and crew members are no longer alive and are featured only in archival interviews, although seeing Marli Renfro, the pinup model who served as Janet Leigh’s body double, is a special treat. Much of the movie’s appeal lies in the more off-kilter observations: The curator Timothy Standring discusses the particular version of “Susanna and the Elders” that hangs over Norman Bates’s peephole and notes that, of all the renditions of that scene, the one Hitchcock used strongly connotes voyeurism. Guillermo del Toro expounds on how the shower scene expresses Hitchcock’s Catholic sense of guilt — it shows Marion, who has committed adultery and theft, trying to cleanse herself of a sin that can’t be washed away.But given that the shower scene is perhaps the most brilliantly edited sequence in movie history, it’s no surprise that the editors have much to say. Walter Murch, who took part in creating a tribute to the shower scene in “The Conversation,” annotates portions of Hitchcock’s sequence cut by cut. Amy E. Duddleston, the editor of Gus Van Sant’s 1998 not-quite replica of a remake, looks at the differences between the original and her version, pondering why hers didn’t play. Mr. Rebello relays a funny anecdote (also in his book) about how Hitchcock selected just the right variety of melon — casaba — to mimic the sound of a knife piercing flesh.Not all the interviews are equally sharp (it’s not clear why Elijah Wood had to be here), and it’s easy to tell who is dabbling and who has pored over the sequence again and again to understand its effect. It’s a screen moment to treat with total reverence — and so enduring it could sustain “78/52: Part 2.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Avraham and Shraga inherited the building from their parents.

112,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-12 17:44:02,Marshall,"Review: In ‘Marshall,’ a Legal Pioneer Gives History a Shove",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html,2017-10-13,2017-10-12,Reginald Hudlin’s movie about the crusading lawyer and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall smartly keeps the focus tight.,"Some biopics go for sweeping and exhaustive, trying to cram an entire life into a tidy two hours or so. “Marshall” smartly opts for modest. With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.“Marshall” also stumbles somewhat with the he-said, she-said wrangling. The filmmakers effortlessly lay out the very real existential dangers threatening Joseph, whose fate rests either with Thurgood or the howling white mob outside. But the overly broad performances, especially in the zippy courtroom scenes, drain the movie of nuance and blunt its realism, and the contrapuntal his-and-her flashbacks add little. Ms. Hudson’s performance, with its brassy and brittle notes, and its counterfeit hauteur, comes perilously close to cartoonish. She doesn’t do much for courtroom suspense, and neither does the irresistible Mr. Brown, a world-class scene-stealer whose quavering voice and pleadingly earnest eyes make the strongest case by far.","Chadwick Boseman, Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K.

Yet despite laws dictating that her indigenous performances remain private, Te Ata eventually acted and danced on Broadway and for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s White House. She became an advocate, through her own artistic excellence, for the inherent dignity that the federal government denied American Indians — fittingly, her stage name means “bearer of the morning.” Te Ata’s life story is now the subject of Nathan Frankowski’s film “Te Ata,” which goes for the sweep of an epic despite a tight budget.As depicted, Te Ata, who died in 1995 at the age of 99, grew up as Mary Frances Thompson in the Indian Territory that later became Oklahoma. She devoted her life to relaying the Chickasaw legends she had learned in childhood, in addition to the stories that were shared with her by the diverse American Indian audiences she met on tour.Produced by Chickasaw Nation Productions, “Te Ata” valorizes this little-known hero, introducing elements of myth like a wandering white wolf to mark Te Ata’s life as its own Chickasaw legend. The film sprawls from the Oklahoma plains to old New York, murkily conveying the passage of time and her rising social status. But the movie’s driving force is its mythic performance scenes, which are choreographed, sung and acted with clear, balletic conviction by the film’s star, Q’orianka Kilcher, who collaborated with Chickasaw researchers and advisers. In the film’s most compelling parallel, just as Te Ata grew to be a voice for American Indians who lacked representation, Ms. Kilcher offers her star power on behalf of the Chickasaw.","Q'orianka Kilcher, Gil Birmingham, Brigid Brannagh, Graham Greene",N/A,USA,Nathan Frankowski,"Biography, Drama, History",English,51,Te Ata set her sights on Broadway and what she thought was her life's dream.

In his new movie, “The Foreigner,” which he also helped produce, he loses his joie de vivre soon after the opening credits.Here he plays a single father named Quon, who, as the movie opens, is seen dropping off his daughter at a boutique in London so she can buy a dress for a dance. Then a terrorist bombing blows the block to smithereens and turns Quon into an aspiring avenger. After facing roadblocks with the local authorities, he trains his sights on Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), an Irish political operative who, Quon is convinced, knows something about the “authentic I.R.A.” that is claiming responsibility for the bombing.What’s that, you ask? “Authentic I.R.A.?” Why, yes, apparently. In this film’s convoluted scenario, jam-packed with morally bankrupt people doing ugly things to one another, a Northern Irish faction is making an aggressive comeback. The movie, directed by Martin Campbell, is based on a novel called “The Chinaman,” by Stephen Leather, whose I.R.A.-heavy plot may have made sense when it was written in 1992. This boneheaded update practically defines the term scab picking.But back to the action: Cryptically, and implacably, demanding names of the perpetrators, Quon pursues Hennessy to his country home and makes like a senior-citizen Rambo in the woods. Mr. Chan is in his early 60s, and he doesn’t deliver the action pizazz here that he used to. Nor, frankly, does he summon enough gravitas to be persuasive in the role of a grief-maddened father. For what it’s worth, Mr. Brosnan, as Quon’s nemesis, sells the angry-all-the-time requirement for his character.","Katie Leung, Jackie Chan, Rufus Jones, Mark Tandy","$33,964,179","UK, China, USA",Martin Campbell,"Action, Crime, Drama","English, Mandarin",55,"A humble businessman with a buried past seeks justice when his daughter is killed in an act of terrorism.

The film follows one such student over about two years.The movie begins with Daje Shelton, known as Boonie, then 17, visiting a courtroom after a school fight. The judge, Jimmie M. Edwards, who opened the academy, tells her that he will decide whether to lock her up. The alternative school is her last option for getting a high school diploma, he says. She won’t be able to attend other public schools in Missouri.“For Ahkeem” trails Boonie as she tries to graduate. It’s not clear that she will pass the necessary coursework. Her apparent apathy toward school seems, in part, like the product of a bleak upbringing filled with poverty and street violence. She casually rattles off the names of dead friends (“too many to count”). Boonie also has a boyfriend, which leads to complications that shouldn’t be spoiled.The filming period coincided with the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him.

He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog, unplugging Daddy’s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house, a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator, which strands the family on a Spanish roadside, can halt the fun: Within minutes, an impromptu fiesta, complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers, has materialized to keep them company.Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained, Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum, while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson’s screenplay demands.In only one scene do we feel genuinely moved, as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It’s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed. For a movie about an extraordinary couple who rarely played it safe, “Breathe” is all too content to do just that.","Andrew Garfield, Claire Foy, Ed Speleers, Tom Hollander","$475,685",UK,Andy Serkis,"Biography, Drama, Romance","English, German, Spanish",51,"The inspiring true love story of Robin and Diana Cavendish, an adventurous couple who refuse to give up in the face of a devastating disease.

He settled with his wife, child and mother at a temple in Gifu prefecture where he spends nearly all his time trying to dissuade those in danger of taking their own lives.The men and women here convey deep torment and helplessness. Mr. Nemoto occasionally asks questions, gives advice or offers reasons to live. But more often he listens, and his face registers both empathy for them and sometimes despair at his own shortcomings. “I’m sorry,” he says softly to one troubled woman as he looks away. “I’m not being much help, am I?”His nearness to their pain takes a toll. Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here.

Waking up on her birthday in a strange man’s dorm room after a supposed one night stand, she stumbles through her day until, en route to her surprise party that night, she is brutally murdered by a masked attacker. Unfortunately, she’s about to experience this particular day again — multiple times.Niftily paced and tight as a chokehold, the script (by the comic-book writer Scott Lobdell) delivers just enough variation to hold our interest. The means of Tree’s expirations are unoriginal and not especially scary, but the director, Christopher Landon, maintains a breezy momentum while she wakes, runs, croaks and repeats. With each resurrection, she’s in slightly worse shape, but marginally better-tempered, giving Ms. Rothe room to deepen the character and arc from unsympathetic victim to loving girlfriend.Rarely out of our sight, Ms. Rothe is inexhaustible and funny, with Israel Broussard a perfect foil as her bemused, sweetly bland love interest. But it’s the newcomer Rachel Matthews as Danielle, the snippy sorority president, who’s the natural comedian.

The resonances begin with its title. “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” takes a literary angle that indirectly suggests The New Yorker, J. D. Salinger and, to some extent, Woody Allen. Mr. Baumbach sticks with the short-story conceit throughout, but he uses it as both a guiding principle and a means to surprise.After the quiet opening credits (delivered in a terribly genteel typeface), the first line of the first story appears: “Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.” The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off.This is good for a laugh (and there are more to come), but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan, a different side of the character appears. His daughter, Eliza (Grace Van Patten), has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father, which he shrugs off with good humor. When “Head to Toe,” a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car’s stereo, Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn’t, but as it happens, he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well), Danny seems, overall, a great dad and a warm-hearted guy.But Danny’s father, Harold, immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit — Eliza just for a night, as she’s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer, as he’s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman, Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can’t help commenting on repeatedly, talking over everyone around him: Danny, Eliza; his current wife and the world’s worst cook, Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later, his other son, Matthew (Ben Stiller), a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps.These characters have a lot to work out, and they do work it out, mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza’s first student film, a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named “Pagina-Man,” is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season.None of the Meyerowitzes are fulfilled, and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold’s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement, as when, on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen, in a droll cameo), he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says “I think this is my copy of ‘Buddenbrooks.’”With this film, Mr. Baumbach has achieved a near-perfect balance between engagement and discomfort. In “The Squid and the Whale” and “Margot at the Wedding,” something drove him to depict family squabbles with a candor that approached cruelty. The anger in those movies and some of his others was bracing, though a little more so than necessary. As boisterous and edgy as “The Meyerowitz Stories” gets, it is a more mellow film, and to my eyes and ears all the better for it.As is customary in Mr. Baumbach’s pictures, the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious, Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character, and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller’s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic, it is Mr. Sandler who excels, both riotously and poignantly.Mr. Baumbach’s fondness for his characters is such that as the movie passes its 90-minute mark, it becomes evident that he doesn’t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind.","Adam Sandler, Grace Van Patten, Dustin Hoffman, Elizabeth Marvel",N/A,USA,Noah Baumbach,"Comedy, Drama",English,79,An estranged family gathers together in New York City for an event celebrating the artistic work of their father.,TV-MA,Netflix,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",13 Oct 2017,112 min,The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),Noah Baumbach,2017,7,"26,519","[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '93%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '79/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the meyerowitz stories (new and selected),,,,,,,,,

For one thing, the buildup is so grippingly patient that we’re more than halfway through before the titular battleground is reached. And for another, this painstakingly paced thriller displays an intensity of purpose that makes it impossible to dismiss as well-executed trash.Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie stars a revelatory Vince Vaughn as Bradley Thomas, a recovering alcoholic, laid-off mechanic and newly expectant father. A charismatic bruiser with a baby-soft face and piledriver body, Bradley favors a dry turn of phrase — when asked how he’s doing, he responds “South of OK, north of cancer” — and a placid demeanor. This last is blown when, early on, we watch him rip apart his wife’s car with his bare hands.He has good reason. But the implacability of the act, and the meticulous deconstruction of the vehicle, reveals not only Bradley’s brute strength and boiling point, but also his director’s death grip on style and tempo. And when Bradley’s temporary drug-running job with an old associate (Marc Blucas) goes south and he’s forced to navigate a series of increasingly atrocious confinements, Mr. Zahler and his cinematographer, Benji Bakshi, never lose focus. Rejecting the jittery shooting style and sped-up splatter that distinguishes so many modern action movies — where mayhem flashes past too swiftly to register as a valid plot point or viable moral outcome — they plant their camera with such eerie stillness that every punch has traction.There are a lot of punches. Like Mr. Zahler’s 2015 debut, the clever horror-western “Bone Tomahawk,” “Brawl” features violence that’s lurid and often ludicrous. (At some point, I lost count of the heads being mashed, bashed and ground into the dirt.) Yet Bradley, stripped to a single, galvanizing intention — to save his kidnapped wife (Jennifer Carpenter) and unborn daughter by killing a high-value inmate — never loses our sympathy. His fundamental decency has been so carefully established (even the detective questioning him knows this is no ordinary lug) that the medieval damage he inflicts with fists and feet seems, if not always justifiable, at least understandable.The role must have been punishing, but, perhaps for the first time, Mr. Vaughn seems comfortable in his towering body. Bradley isn’t flyweight-nimble, he’s a battering ram, and the director wisely surrounds him with wickedly agile supporting players. Both Don Johnson and the great Udo Kier are memorably repulsive as a sadistic warden and a slimy go-between, and Fred Melamed is chillingly hilarious as a persnickety prison intake officer.But it’s Mr. Vaughn, with his loose-hipped gait and simmering menace, who brings the movie home. Wrapped in a swaggering soundtrack of ’70s-style soul (composed by Mr. Zahler and Jeff Herriott, and performed by the likes of Butch Tavares and the O’Jays), he gives Bradley a forlorn determination. There is something so poignant in the performance that it lifts this uncompromisingly savage picture above and beyond its vicious beat-downs. Bradley’s wife may be pregnant, but it’s the actor who plays him who could experience new life.","Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Carpenter, Don Johnson, Udo Kier",N/A,USA,S.

By dint of compassion, cussedness and innovation — like training ordinary villagers to act as community health visitors — the two would go on to build clinics and create programs that could be imitated worldwide.Gathering collaborators along the way — including a wealthy philanthropist and their group’s president, Ophelia Dahl (the daughter of the author Roald Dahl) — the men refused to be deterred by institutional rigidity, political apathy or a skeptical scientific community. Their perseverance is cheering, giving the movie a brightly buoyant tone that belies the suffering at its center and renders the sometimes distracting musical score largely unnecessary.Assisted by archival film originally shot for earlier projects, the directors, Kief Davidson and Pedro Kos, build a 30-year-plus dramatic timeline that focuses most intently on Dr. Farmer (who was also profiled in Tracy Kidder’s 2003 book, “Mountains Beyond Mountains”). His quiet outrage over the widely-held assumption that it’s futile to treat the global poor drives this story, which is finally as much about the triumph of a philosophy as of medicine.Dr. Kim agrees. “Optimism is a moral choice,” he says, one that undergirds programs grounded in extreme practicality.

We learn how he pioneered using Jet Skis to tow surfers to unreachable peaks and still experiments with retrofitting boards. He conquered waves thought to be unconquerable and performed feats of derring-do off Tahiti and Maui. (Though a spot he helped discover off Maui became touristy partly because of footage that he and his comrades shot to make money — bummer.)The more mind-numbing hagiographic interludes deal with Mr. Hamilton’s introduction to celebrity, including posing for the fashion photographer Bruce Weber and starring in the surfing movie “North Shore,” which apparently left some viewers thinking he was the jerk he played. Mr. Hamilton’s wife, colleagues and beleaguered orthopedic surgeon seem resigned to indulging his yen for danger. The star and his friends offer harrowing accounts of improbable rescues.But the documentary stirs up most of its sporadic excitement in the surfing footage, of which there is plenty.

Police say it was suicide; friends suspect it was murder.","There are several strong stories in “The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,” a documentary that, in trying to tell them all, takes on too much.Marsha P. Johnson was a transgender activist who played important roles in the Stonewall Riots and the gay-rights movement. Her body was found in the Hudson River in 1992, and while the police labeled her death a suicide, many of her friends suspected she was murdered.Victoria Cruz of the New York City Anti-Violence Project has been exploring the case, and to watch her track down retired detectives and follow potential leads is to see a determined soul at work. By itself, the investigation raises red flags about crime, discrimination and police apathy — more than enough material to supply this film.Yet David France, the director, switches focus often, running extensive footage of past gay-rights gatherings and a recent trial of a man who murdered a transgender woman, as well as interviews with Ms. Johnson’s friends, fellow activists and more. All are inseparable from Ms. Johnson’s story and deserve a place here. But as assembled, the film soon turns scattershot. More strangely, for a documentary whose title implies a look at Ms. Johnson’s life, there are few insights into her early years. Bryce Dessner’s music promises tension that the script, by Mr. France and Mark Blane, only occasionally delivers.It’s no spoiler to say that, at the end, several mysteries remain unsolved here. Though this film doesn’t give definitive answers on what happened to Ms. Johnson, it keeps her memory alive.

Paired with an aloof Kate Winslet — with whom he has less chemistry than he did with Wood Harris, who played his business partner on “The Wire” — he works very hard to appear oblivious to the script’s many idiocies. He does not succeed.A disaster movie by any definition, this sappy adaptation of Charles Martin’s 2010 novel places Ben (Mr. Elba), a melancholy neurosurgeon, on a charter plane to Denver with Alex (Ms. Winslet), a supremely irritating photojournalist. Having joined forces when their commercial flight from Idaho was grounded by a storm, the two are further dismayed when their folksy pilot (Beau Bridges) suffers a stroke and smashes them into a snowy peak. Now they have to rescue not just themselves, but the pilot’s golden Labrador — which has no name and, apparently, no appetite.Caught between the harsh demands of a survival story and the emotional beats of a romantic drama, the director, Hany Abu-Assad, grabs hold of neither. As the pair traipse to safety, artifice rules: A cougar is dispatched with shameless ease; an abandoned cabin manifests just in time to save a life and — almost three weeks into their ordeal — allow the couple to enjoy what is almost certainly malodorous sex. I half expected them to discover the fixings for a full English breakfast.On the upside, the frozen landscapes (shot in Canada by Mandy Walker) are lovely, and the dog is adorable.

The two have been estranged, and there’s friction between them as they reunite for a trek into the mountains.While hiking together they tell tales and recall their pasts. But before you can say “I hope there are no bears around,” they end up sustaining injuries that force them to rely on each other as they struggle to return to civilization.The story line is well-trod, and reminiscent in parts of “The Revenant,” “Mountain Men” and several other films that take place in rough country. Yet Mr. Bomer and Mr. Wiggins are proficient with the sparse dialogue (written by the brothers and directors Alex and Andrew Smith, from a short story by David Quammen), and with situations that are occasionally contrived.Though it’s not high praise to describe the movie as watchable, it’s no rebuke either. The biggest stars here are the Montana locations.

Now in his early 30s, Scott is around the age his father was when playing the amiable cowboy Rowdy Yates in the television series “Rawhide.” The younger Eastwood’s resemblance to his father, and similarity in manner, is such that it sometimes feels as if a younger version of Clint has been digitally spliced into this picture. This is diverting, more so than the actual movie, unfortunately. The dialogue seems to have been composed by a screenwriting bot. Here’s an actual exchange between the brothers:“After this job, I’m done.”“When were you thinking of telling me?”“I just did.”The colorless, TV-series-cheesy direction by Antonio Negret is no help.

The new film “Dina,” which advertises itself as a “real-life romantic comedy,” is an unusually penetrating example of this type of picture. Made by the directing team of Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini, it gets very close to a couple, Dina Buno and Scott Levin, as they plan their wedding.The movie opens with Dina, voluble and vulnerable, asking a dental assistant to take her hand before a dentist drills into a bothersome tooth. The viewer soon learns that Dina is autistic, as is Scott (he refers to himself as “an Aspy”). Her symptoms are, in fact, milder than Scott’s, but a past that scarred her both physically and emotionally compounds problems.They are a sweet couple whom you want to root for, and their conditions and circumstances have imbued them with personalities that some might perceive as quirky. Recalling his proposal to Dina, Scott enthuses to friends, “Red Robin, what a romantic place to get hitched.”Documentaries like this maintain their spell only if they keep the viewer from wondering, “What the hell is the camera doing here?” I lasted until a scene from their honeymoon, in which Dina fills up a champagne-glass shaped bathtub; Scott, who has trouble even conceiving of physical intimacy, is seemingly oblivious to the implications of this action.As it happens, there are some reasonable, if not entirely satisfactory, answers to the question, but the viewer won’t learn them during the movie itself. (Mr. Sickles has known Dina his whole life; his father was one of her teachers.)

While the film includes footage of Ms. Vargas onstage and recordings of her music, it doesn’t convey the power of her artistry, giving the viewer a sense of why, to paraphrase the musician Miguel Bosé from the film, listeners might believe that she could die from being overwhelmed in the middle of a song. (Separately, we learn that may have been her wish.)Ms. Vargas was born in Costa Rica, moved to Mexico as a child and died there in 2012 at age 93. The movie’s centerpiece is footage of Ms. Vargas speaking for herself, in material that Ms. Gund shot in 1991. These candid conversations have been supplemented with the usual array of photos and talking heads — people who knew Ms. Vargas from collaborations, love and friendship — along with a rundown of the singer’s life.Although she became known for her performances of ranchera, especially songs by the composer José Alfredo Jiménez, Ms. Vargas eschewed the flamboyant hoop skirts and jewelry associated with performers of the genre, wearing pants and earning a reputation for, as it’s described in the film, “singing like a man.” She didn’t come out as a lesbian until the age of 81, but according to the film, her sexuality was no secret. We hear about how she swooned over Frida Kahlo, among many other women. Severe alcoholism stalled her career, until a cabaret performance in Mexico City in the early 1990s rekindled the spark and eventually led to fresh international acclaim. (She did not perform much in the United States; The New York Times interviewed her in 2003 on the occasion of her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 83.)“Chavela lived in a continual state of farewell,” says the director Pedro Almodóvar, who befriended the singer in her later life and used her songs in some of his films.

129,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 16:44:02,Blade Runner 2049,"Review: In ‘Blade Runner 2049,’ Hunting Replicants Amid Strangeness",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/movies/blade-runner-2049-review-ryan-gosling-harrison-ford.html,2017-10-06,2017-10-02,The director Denis Villeneuve tries to both honor Ridley Scott’s 1982 dystopian classic and to slip free of its considerable shadow.,"A lot of the movies released in the late 1970s and early ’80s have spawned franchises, merchandising empires and what we are now invited to call “cinematic universes.” “Blade Runner,” Ridley Scott’s initially underrated 1982 adaptation of a novel by Philip K. Dick, accomplished something more unusual. It sent tendrils of influence — pictorial, conceptual and spiritual — into every corner of the culture and inspired a mystery cult.Like other sacred texts, the film invites doctrinal arguments and esoteric inquiries. One of my fondest memories as a father and a film critic is of an impromptu post-screening seminar with two 11-year-olds about occult meanings and hidden clues in the director’s cut. How do we know (if indeed we do know) that Harrison Ford is a replicant? What is the significance of the origami unicorn? Are Sean Young’s shoulder pads for real?[Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling Discuss “Blade Runner 2049”]Alongside these basic interpretive questions, an academic subfield has blossomed, isolating “Blade Runner” as one of the original symptoms of postmodernism, a terminal and interminable disease of the mind. The film’s blend of curatorial nostalgia and dystopian prophecy captured a mood of self-conscious melancholy in its moment and set a tone of melancholy self-consciousness that has endured ever since. Maybe the real world never quite achieved the smoky neon-noir glow of Mr. Scott’s Los Angeles, but the map of our collective dream world was permanently redrawn.The precise future “Blade Runner” projected is now less than two years away, and the next chapter, once something to be dreaded, seems, if anything, overdue. “Blade Runner 2049,” directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, tries both to honor the original and to slip free of its considerable shadow. That’s no easy feat, and it’s worth noting right away that, in narrow movie terms, Mr. Villeneuve, who also directed “Arrival,” mostly succeeds. From the opening aerial shots of a thoroughly denatured agricultural landscape and the lethal confrontation that follows, we know we are in the presence of a masterly visual tactician and a shrewd storyteller.[The “Blade Runner 2049” Look]We are also in territory that is both familiar and disorienting. A brief note explains what has and hasn’t changed in the 30 years since the events in the first “Blade Runner.” Three-wheeled spinners still zoom through the California skies, and the building-size video advertisements have evolved into seductive, R-rated holograms. The titular profession — hunting down and “retiring” renegade members of the almost-human, genetically engineered android species known as replicants — is practiced with the same brutal doggedness as in the old days.A new, more obedient type of replicant has been developed by a corporation led by a tech visionary played by Jared Leto. (His lieutenant Luv is played by Sylvia Hoeks, a far more vivid and persuasively terrifying presence than the mannered Mr. Leto.) One of these models is our hero, an L.A.P.D. employee known as K. (It’s an abbreviation of his serial number and also, maybe, an allusion to Franz Kafka’s avatar of modern alienation. That poor fellow’s full name was Josef K; when this K acquires a human pseudonym, it’s Joe.)Speaking of avatars of alienation, K moves through his days with the unhurried shuffle and downcast baby blues of Ryan Gosling. This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling’s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it — his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa — makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also, in 2017, something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood’s venerable ideal of masculine cool, a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul.At first, of course, we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint, showing the weary, cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K’s. The whole point of “Blade Runner,” though, is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas), his devoted girlfriend, who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application.We are prepared to acknowledge the pathos and the paradox of her condition, which is a version of K’s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings, desires and dreams — that they are mirrors of us, that we are replicas of them — has long been a staple of speculative cinema. “Blade Runner 2049” does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as, say, Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” or Spike Jonze’s “Her,” but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast, a spur to the audience’s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs.There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include “Sicario,” “Prisoners” and “Arrival” — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.Movies are by their nature hybrids of technology and sentiment, machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first “Blade Runner” approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood, German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except, of course, that it was the question: How do we know what is real, ourselves included?“I know what’s real,” says the hero of that movie when — at long last! — he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard, the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford, as if I needed to tell you), in an abandoned Las Vegas casino, surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling, suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department, acquits himself well enough, and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do.Which is not something I’m going to explain, at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That’s fair enough, but it’s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie, Mr. Scott’s “Blade Runner” cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don’t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve’s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.As such, “Blade Runner 2049” stands in relation to “Blade Runner” almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious “improvement,” tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then — when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri — you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer, more romantic, more heroic, less determined by the corporate program.Then again: Who knows at this point if that sense of loss, of lost possibility, is even real? It might be nothing more than an artificially implanted memory.","Ryan Gosling, Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Mark Arnold","$91,800,042","USA, UK, Hungary, Canada",Denis Villeneuve,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","English, Finnish, Japanese, Hungarian, Russian, Somali, Spanish",81,"A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.",R,Warner Bros.

The new one has Ellen Page and some horror movie tricks.","Remakes — especially of beloved classics — run the risk of alienating sentimental moviegoers. With “Flatliners,” Columbia Pictures takes a bold, innovative step to address this issue.It’s startling in its simplicity. The well-known 1990 movie being remade here is something other than beloved, or classic. Rather it is remembered as a widely-derided post-Brat Pack ensemble piece. (And while the movie was indeed largely derided, The New York Times gave it a positive review, as did the critic Roger Ebert.) The potential for accusations of sacrilege is minimal.The original “Flatliners,” directed by Joel Schumacher from a script by Peter Filardi, teamed the newly minted Julia Roberts with the lesser-known peers Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Billy Baldwin in an underbaked story of medical students in the grip of a literally morbid obsession. Intent on exploring life after death, they temporarily put themselves into the uncharted territory of brain death (hence the title), with what were supposedly scary side effects relating to the wreckages of their past. Mr. Schumacher’s movie is more a failed tone poem than a horror picture, and to its credit, this new version, with a trickier script by Ben Ripley and hyper-competent direction from the Swedish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev improves on it — by making it behave like a horror movie every now and then.Still. As much as I try not to outsmart the movies I watch, when this one opened with a color-desaturated scene of Ellen Page driving a car with a young girl in the passenger seat, the devil on my shoulder said, “There is going to be a terrible accident, the girl is going to die, and this will spur the Ellen Page character into exploring the afterlife.”I was right. This set the tone for much of the rest of my viewing.Mr. Sutherland shows up here, but he doesn’t reprise his irresponsible character from the first movie; he is a supervisor to the five medical students having after-death adventures, each one a particular type (There’s James Norton’s playboy, Nina Dobrev’s alpha, Kiersey Clemons’s striver and Diego Luna’s Diego Luna), saddled with guilt that haunts them despite their near-death experiences also turning them into super-geniuses.This film did not screen for critics, nor was it previewed in New York theaters on a Thursday night, as is usually customary with studio pictures. I imagine Columbia understood that it had something arguably worse than a dog on its hands. This “Flatliners” is in fact a new definition of “meh.”","Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin",N/A,USA,Joel Schumacher,"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi",English,55,"Five medical students experiment with ""near death"" experiences, until the dark consequences of past tragedies begin to jeopardize their lives.",R,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,"[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",10 Aug 1990,115 min,Flatliners,Peter Filardi,1990,6.6,"71,554","[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '48%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '55/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",flatliners,Flatliners,Sony Pictures,3373.0,-31.0,33.0,102.0,16877430.0,52.0,17489.0

That doesn’t mean this leisurely portrait of its title character, a cantankerous old coot (Harry Dean Stanton, in one of his last roles), is any more eventful at the end than at the beginning. Rather, the accumulation of spot-on performances and long-familiar faces, small-town routines and dusty-worn locations, finally coalesces into a picture that’s greater than the sum of its oft-clichéd parts.Maudlin and meandering, this first feature by the actor John Carroll Lynch could have sprouted organically from the compost of its star’s back catalog. (The script, by Logan Sparks and Drago Sumonja, was written as an almost biographical celebration of Mr. Stanton’s life.) We’ve seen him stride through arid desert towns like this before, though now, as Lucky, his gait is more fragile if no less purposeful. Following the same daily routine — an unvarying trek from home to diner to bodega to bar — Lucky would rather watch game shows than engage in small talk. The townsfolk (warmly played by David Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr., among others) don’t seem to mind, and are even quite fond of him, in the way of longtime owners of a rather surly pet.Then, one day, he falls down, and the film subtly shifts from a quietly comical character study to a delicate reflection on loneliness and mortality. As Lucky bonds with a fellow World War II veteran and, in one lovely scene, slides into an impromptu song at a child’s birthday party, the movie is more intent on measuring the weight of a life than contemplating death. So when our cranky hero, a lifelong atheist, declares that there is no soul, it seems an extraordinary line to give an actor who spent his entire career proving otherwise.","Harry Dean Stanton, David Lynch, Ron Livingston, Ed Begley Jr.",N/A,USA,John Carroll Lynch,"Comedy, Drama","English, Spanish",80,The spiritual journey of a ninety-year-old atheist.,NOT RATED,Lucky Movies,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Sep 2017,88 min,Lucky,"Logan Sparks (screenplay), Drago Sumonja (screenplay)",2017,7.4,"11,366","[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '80/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",lucky,,,,,,,,,

Maybe you heard.Among the team’s most exultant fans was Eddie Vedder, the frontman for Pearl Jam. The band may be synonymous with Seattle and the grunge-rock scene there that spawned it, but Mr. Vedder was born and raised in suburban Chicago, and is devoted to the Cubs. In 2008, he even wrote “All the Way” for the club.“Let’s Play Two: Pearl Jam Live at Wrigley Field” — the title was a favorite expression of the beloved Cubs shortstop Ernie Banks — is a blend of concert film and sports diary, chronicling Pearl Jam’s two August shows at Wrigley during the 2016 season, then capturing highlights of the team’s championship run.Directed by Danny Clinch, “Let’s Play Two” provides neither as complete a Pearl Jam concert as “Touring Band 2000” nor as illuminating a band history as Cameron Crowe’s “Pearl Jam Twenty.” But it shares a side of Mr. Vedder his fans will enjoy: the baseball aficionado who fills out a scorecard and treats Wrigley sod as holy ground. A rehearsal with other band members — the guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready, the bassist Jeff Ament and the drummer Matt Cameron — atop Murphy’s Bleachers, across from the ballpark, recalls the Beatles’ rooftop concert, and their Wrigley performances of hits like “Corduroy,” “Jeremy” and “Alive” demonstrate Pearl Jam remains as potent as ever.The film’s last third toggles, somewhat awkwardly, between the shows and clips from the postseason.

133,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,American Made,"Review: ‘American Made’ Has Tom Cruise. And Lies, Spies and Coke.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/movies/american-made-review-tom-cruise.html,2017-09-29,2017-09-28,"Mr. Cruise plays a real-life pilot turned smuggler who worked for the C.I.A., in Doug Liman’s new movie.","The tagline for “American Made,” a breezily, at times woozily rollicking Tom Cruise vehicle, announces that it is “based on a true lie” — though the movie also asserts that it is based on a true story. But who’s quibbling? This is, after all, a Hollywood fantasy starring Mr. Cruise as Barry Seal, a real-life smuggler. An enigma with multiple chins, Mr. Seal was apparently known as El Gordo (the Fat Man), a name he may have picked up while working for a drug cartel, the C.I.A. or the Drug Enforcement Administration.It can be hard to keep tabs on the movie’s Barry, a pilot who racks up lots of miles while serving different masters. When the story opens, he is flying for T.W.A. and bored out of his evidently simple, rather dangerously restless mind. On the job, he amuses himself by flipping a few switches, jerking the controls and abruptly awakening sleeping passengers. His life takes a wild turn when a shady C.I.A. smiler, Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), makes Barry an offer to help his country or something. Before long, Barry is cozying up to Pablo Escobar and smuggling cocaine and AK-47s across the Americas. Every so often, he drops into Panama to swap packages with that country’s strongman, Manuel Noriega.This kind of secret world is familiar terrain for the director Doug Liman, who kick-started the “Bourne” spy franchise and directed “Fair Game,” a fictional take on some real-world intrigue involving Valerie Plame Wilson, a former C.I.A. officer, and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a onetime diplomat. “American Made,” in its self-amused tone and skittering rhythms, though, is closer to the thriller “Edge of Tomorrow,” Mr. Liman and Mr. Cruise’s movie about a man — a wrong-guy, wrong-place type — who dies to live another day only to die (repeat). Mr. Liman likes playing with Mr. Cruise’s persona, say, by messing up that famous smile, and he clearly likes letting his star strut and glide.Mr. Liman also likes stories about people with secret selves. Maybe it’s an interest he picked up from his father, Arthur L. Liman, who was the chief counsel to the Senate committee during its 1987 Iran-contra investigation. The real Mr. Seal may have played a jaw-droppingly outlandish role in that notorious affair, which, among many other byzantine turns, involved the National Security Council funneling aid to the Nicaraguan contras. The scandal encompassed a vast cast of characters that included President Ronald Reagan and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. A few show up in “American Made” either as fictionalized supporting characters or as themselves, smiling and slinking in archival images.Written by Gary Spinelli, “American Made” goes down easily, especially if you don’t let the historical record with its real-world stakes bother you. Mr. Cruise’s brisk, ingratiating performance — all smiles, hard-charging physicality and beads of sweat — does a lot to soften the edges. But Mr. Liman doesn’t press Mr. Cruise to dig into the character, and the actor mostly hurdles forward in a movie that never gets around to asking what makes Barry run and why. So Barry just runs and he flies and he flies some more, delivering coke and accumulating suitcases of cash that he buries and stashes in closets. (It’s hard not to think that Mr. Cruise signed on to the movie so he could do all his own flying.)There’s a lot going for “American Made,” which spins like a top and has the visually beguiling, somewhat jaundiced look of a faded old Polaroid. So it’s too bad that Mr. Liman himself didn’t burrow in here as a filmmaker. The real Mr. Seal has been both the main and side attraction in many articles, books, documentaries and hard-core propaganda flicks, including some hinged on the Conspiratorial Industrial Complex which emerged during the Clinton presidency. Mr. Seal was also the subject of “Doublecrossed,” a 1991 HBO docudrama starring Dennis Hopper (which is vaguely amusing if only because Mr. Hopper played a very different coke smuggler in “Easy Rider”).“American Made” encourages and earns your laughter, although it also provokes skepticism, particularly in its attempt to portray Barry as a picaresque hero, one of those rogues tumbling and swaggering from adventure to adventure in a world that’s more corrupt than they are. After all, it asks, how bad can Barry really be, especially given the company he keeps? He doesn’t kill anyone, not exactly, and he’s nice to his wife, Lucy (Sarah Wright Olsen), and their kids. A slightly downscale version of Margot Robbie’s character in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Lucy has a few tangy moments, but she and the kids mostly enhance the visual design, much like the period cars and costumes.There are moments when it feels as if Mr. Liman’s breakneck pacing is partly an attempt to distract us, to keep us from looking or thinking too hard about the grotesquely corrupt circus parading onscreen. Mr. Cruise’s performance often seems similarly calculated. Barry likes to leap before he thinks: “All this is legal?” he asks, scarcely pausing before plunging into the fray — and Mr. Cruise regularly widens his eyes in what seems to be an effort to convey Barry’s incredulity. It’s dissembling that is about as convincing as the Wolf leering in granny’s nightie. In truth, this Barry is just another ugly American, a happy hustler with a what-me-worry smile and a foot planted on another man’s throat.","Tom Cruise, Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Jesse Plemons","$51,071,805","USA, Japan",Doug Liman,"Action, Biography, Comedy","English, Spanish",65,"The story of Barry Seal, an American pilot who became a drug-runner for the CIA in the 1980s in a clandestine operation that would be exposed as the Iran-Contra Affair.",R,Universal Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Sep 2017,115 min,American Made,Gary Spinelli,2017,7.2,"116,183","[{'Value': '7.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '86%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '65/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",american made,American Made,Universal,3675.0,-6.0,73.0,50.0,51342000.0,77.0,17514.0

Just so we’re clear: I’m describing the premise of a new movie starring Liam Neeson. What did you think?The movie is “Mark Felt — the Man Who Brought Down the White House,” and the headlines from which it was ripped are more than four decades old. The title sounds like a category error, since the White House, as of this writing, is still standing. But Mark Felt, though almost nobody knew back in the ’70s, was undoubtedly instrumental in ending the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. The associate director of the F.B.I. at the time of the Watergate burglary, Felt entered the annals of Nixon-era scandal as Deep Throat, a pseudonym bestowed by the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward.Felt, who didn’t much like the name, identified himself as Mr. Woodward’s source in 2005. The memoir he published before his death in 2008 has been turned, by the writer and director Peter Landesman, a former journalist, into a hectic, intermittently intriguing and accidentally timely procedural thriller, with Mr. Neeson in the title role. His face as sharp as the blade of a hatchet, his brow creased with his weariness and his eyes ablaze with indignation, Mr. Neeson is a mighty presence on a small, cramped stage.The word Shakespearean often attaches itself to the Nixon administration — it’s an adjective that marks the place where political power intersects with moral instability — and “Mark Felt” tries to infuse some dramatic grandeur into what is in essence a chronicle of bureaucratic scheming. The president and most of the president’s men are rarely seen and only occasionally heard over the phone. Felt and his F.B.I. colleagues hustle in and out of offices, whisper in corridors and ride in dark, period-appropriate sedans. For the benefit of viewers who may have trouble distinguishing one white guy in a suit from another (the earnest and talented supporting cast includes Josh Lucas, Tony Goldwyn, Ike Barinholtz and Brian d’Arcy James), they often address one another by full name and title.Even for die-hard Watergate nerds, the movie can be a tough slog. The main conflict is between Felt and his new boss, L. Patrick Gray (Marton Csokas), who Felt comes to believe is functioning as Nixon’s mole in the F.B.I., and who also wants to limit the bureau’s Watergate inquiries. (Gray is also the man who took the job Felt thought should have been his, and wounded pride may be among his motives.) Meanwhile, on the home front, Felt and his long-suffering, heavy-drinking wife, Audrey (Diane Lane), worry about their daughter, who has vanished into the mists of the counterculture. There is a potentially interesting tension between Felt’s professional duties and his personal life that never fully takes shape.“Mark Felt” is a sharp portrait set against a blurry background, a history lesson that won’t help you on the test. It is possible to savor the crags and shadows of Mr. Neeson’s performance without quite grasping why Mr. Landesman thinks the story is worthy of such somber, serious and sustained attention. Both the internal politics of the F.B.I. in the aftermath of J. Edgar Hoover’s death and the larger political and social dramas of the late ’60s and early ’70s are invoked, but neither the national nor the institutional stakes are illuminated with sufficient clarity or force.","Liam Neeson, Diane Lane, Marton Csokas, Tony Goldwyn",N/A,USA,Peter Landesman,"Biography, Drama, History, Thriller",English,49,"The story of Mark Felt, who under the name ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncover the Watergate scandal in 1972.",PG-13,N/A,"[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Sep 2017,103 min,Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House,"Mark Felt (based on the books by), John D.

What unsupervised time they have is spent crashing on each other’s couches, playing video games, and identifying crushes from their yearbooks, and if Zach seems a little more handsome, a little more sociable, a little less nerdy than his friend, it’s the kind of difference in temperament that might have gone unacknowledged forever. But when Zach and Josh find themselves involved in a horrific accident that claims the life of a friend, the underlying tensions between the boys are stretched thin by guilt, panic and paranoia.The performances from the film’s young cast members are uniformly excellent, including Owen Campbell as Zach and Charlie Tahan as Josh. But the direction from Mr. Phillips is what makes “Super Dark Times” unusual. In the movie’s scenes of violence, in particular, what we hear complicates what we see, as the impact of blunt physical trauma mixes with the film’s score to suggest the psychic magnitude of accidental violence. While another movie might have leaned harder on ripped-from-the-headlines prurience, “Super Dark Times” instead aims to become a more elusive pleasure — a simple story, well told.","Owen Campbell, Charlie Tahan, Elizabeth Cappuccino, Amy Hargreaves","$29,759",USA,Kevin Phillips,"Drama, Thriller",English,75,"Teenagers Zach and Josh have been best friends their whole lives, but when a gruesome accident leads to a cover-up, the secret drives a wedge between them and propels them down a rabbit hole of escalating paranoia and violence.",NOT RATED,The Orchard,"[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Sep 2017,103 min,Super Dark Times,"Ben Collins, Luke Piotrowski",2017,6.6,"11,699","[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '90%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '75/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",super dark times,Super Dark Times,The Orchard,78.0,388.0,1.0,78.0,33109.0,30.0,17467.0

Yet it has a heart, too, and that adds a surprising amount of emotion to this above-average science-fiction film.Set in the past, present and future, all story lines center on Marc (Tom Hughes). His life is charted from his first breath (the movie’s opening shows an actual birth, up close) through scenes of his childhood before moving to a time near today, when he’s diagnosed with terminal cancer.Marc decides to cryo-freeze his body in hopes of later being cured, leading to his reanimation — or rebirth, if you will — in 2084. It’s no surprise that his plans have unexpected consequences.Mateo Gil, the writer and director, prizes ideas as much as action. Voice-overs have Marc expounding on memory, longing and mortality while the script probes the side effects of technology. The future scenes evoke the creepiness and claustrophobia of “Ex Machina” and, like that film, hark back to the “Frankenstein” story.The romance at the center of “Realive” keeps it from becoming too cold. Marc’s girlfriend, Naomi (Oona Chaplin), struggles with losing him, while Elizabeth (Charlotte Le Bon), his nurse in 2084, has affections and worries of her own. A montage recalling Marc and Naomi’s on-again, off-again relationship is one of several lovely moments from the exceptional cast.“Realive” occasionally sets a cautious pace, and the voice-overs can be wordy.

Based on what we’ve seen, she may not make it another week, let alone four months.Since returning from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Sarge (Kate Nowlin) swings between confusion and rage. After losing control at her coming-home party (a scene no less tense for being inevitable), she leaves her husband to stay at a secluded campground by a Minnesota lake. There she works nearly nonstop, or exercises to exhaustion, or drinks herself into a stupor to keep her demons at bay.There’s not much more plot. This drama, written by Ms. Nowlin and her husband, Remy Auberjonois, who also directed, centers on Sarge’s inner struggles. Other than a few references to her combat service and to a physical injury she sustained, the script relies on subtext and Ms. Nowlin’s expressions to convey her condition. She’s up to the task; even in the many silent moments, she’s compelling.Still, while this worthy film sidesteps clichés — there are no horrid flashbacks or emotional speeches — its spareness occasionally feels planned rather than spontaneous.

138,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Our Souls at Night,Review: Robert Redford and Jane Fonda Are Neighbors With Benefits in ‘Our Souls at Night’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/movies/our-souls-at-night-review-robert-redford-jane-fonda.html,2017-09-29,2017-09-27,This small-town romance was adapted from the novel by Kent Haruf.,"As gentle as a moth’s wing, as soft and sweet as the flesh of a marshmallow, “Our Souls at Night” chronicles the blossoming of a December-December romance between two neighbors in the fictional prairie town of Holt, Colo. It begins not with a spark of passion but with a sensible, if unusual, proposal. Addie Moore shows up at Louis Waters’s house and asks if he will sleep with her. Addie doesn’t mean she wants to have sex with Louis. She wants to slide under the covers next to him, turn off the bedside lamp and chat quietly until slumber arrives, simulating the easy marital intimacy that the two of them, both long widowed, have learned to live without. Louis, startled by the idea, agrees to think about it.He and Addie are solid, respectable people of a kind who usually show up in movies to be mocked or sentimentalized. The disappointments and satisfactions they have lived through are etched on their faces, which are also the faces of two very famous movie stars — Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. Viewers with long memories or heavy TCM habits will recall that 50 years ago they starred as New York newlyweds in “Barefoot in the Park.” In 1979, they reunited, with a touch more denim, in “The Electric Horseman.” The intervening decades have hardly diminished their charm or their skill, and part of the pleasure of this film, directed by Ritesh Batra (“The Lunchbox”), lies in the rediscovery of what wonderful actors they can be, and how good they are together.“Our Souls at Night,” adapted (by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) from Kent Haruf’s final, posthumously published novel, is too cautious and cozy to be a great movie, or even a very interesting one. The music (by Elliot Goldenthal) telegraphs the emotions too precisely, and Mr. Haruf’s wry and subtle plot is mishandled, so that there is both too much dramatic conflict and not quite enough. When Addie and Louis’s grown-up children show up — played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Judy Greer — they drag in some bulky baggage. Each family has a painful event in its past, and each child represents a textbook drawing of the consequences of that pain, rather than a fully embodied, credibly suffering human being.Luckily, the stars have humanity to spare, and very little left to prove. With her careful diction and a bearing that conveys starchiness and sensuality in perfect, improbable balance, Ms. Fonda turns middle-class maturity into a bewitching form of charisma. Addie’s approach to Louis, a man she has never known that well, is driven less by neediness than by a rational understanding of what she needs. She needs to be less alone.Louis, for his part, doesn’t mind his solitude. Mr. Redford, who barely uttered a word in “All Is Lost,” at first seems prepared to match that feat here, interrupting what seem like monthlong pauses to mutter, sigh and occasionally deliver a complete sentence. He is one of the great minimalists of American cinema, an actor who can dazzle you by opening the tiniest window onto a character’s inner life. When Louis meets Addie’s young grandson, Jamie (the remarkable Iain Armitage, seen on television in “Big Little Lies” and “Young Sheldon”), the encounter awakens a long-dormant paternal instinct, and also a streak of boyishness.Addie’s companionship awakens other urges, but “Our Souls at Night” is in no hurry to confirm the hunches of the audience or the suspicions of the town’s nosier citizens. (One of these, a blowhard friend of Louis’s, is played by Bruce Dern, who once upon a time was Tom Buchanan to Mr. Redford’s Jay Gatsby). Since Addie and Louis are already sleeping together, there’s no need to rush into anything.","Judy Greer, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Matthias Schoenaerts",N/A,USA,Ritesh Batra,"Drama, Romance",English,69,"Fonda and Redford will star as Addie Moore and Louis Waters, a widow and widower who've lived next to each other for years.

Insects Never Looked so Yummy.,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/movies/bugs-review.html,2017-09-27,2017-09-26,Ben Reade and Josh Evans travel the world to visit cultures where insects are prepared as food.,"If an enterprising restaurateur is eager to grill up some insects and make a mint in the West Village, the time has never been riper. “Bugs,” an entertaining and eye-opening documentary from Andreas Johnsen, will send moviegoers out with a feeling of culinary adventurousness, eager to sample well-prepared escamoles (ant larvae) or termite queen with mango. (The maggot mousse might be pushing it.)The movie follows Ben Reade, a chef, and Josh Evans, a researcher, then both of the Nordic Food Lab in Denmark, as they travel the world to visit cultures where insects are prepared as food. (Roberto Flore, another chef, joins the trip later.) The Nordic lab, a project initiated by Claus Meyer and René Redzepi, founders of the foodie polestar Noma, has a mission to explore “food diversity and deliciousness.” The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that the use of insects as food may have long-term benefits for the global food supply. It also offers cooks new possibilities for tastes and textures. (If you thought using whole animals was trendy, just wait until you try dishes that use multiple developmental stages.)As they pay visits to Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Mexico and Japan, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans are effectively M.C.s on the world’s weirdest episode of “Iron Chef.” (“To be honest, I would rather a normal Camembert,” Mr. Reade confesses after sampling casu marzu, a maggot-infested cheese from Italy.)Despite their largely successful experiments, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans express skepticism that the delicacies they’ve tried could — or should — be produced on a commercial scale.

140,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Battle of the Sexes,"Review: Advantage, Bobby, but Game, Set, Match, Billie Jean in ‘Battle of the Sexes’",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/movies/review-battle-of-the-sexes-billie-jean-king-bobby-riggs.html,2017-09-22,2017-09-21,Emma Stone plays Billie Jean King and Steve Carell plays Bobby Riggs in a movie about the 1973 tennis match that became a referendum on equality.,"Every so often an exceptionally capable woman has to prove her worth by competing against a clown. That’s one of the durable truisms of “Battle of the Sexes,” a glib, enjoyable fictionalization of the 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She was 29 and one of the top female tennis players in the world. He was 55 and had been a world champion before she was born. She was a feminist symbol and the first female athlete to win more than $100,000 in a single year; he was a self-avowed male chauvinist pig who liked to gamble big. It was a man vs. woman match made for maximum public-relations gimmickry but also a deadly serious referendum on equality on and off the court.So it was personal and it was political, which “Battle of the Sexes” gets. It was also entertainment, which is where the movie really excels. Nice and easy, it sets the players and early 1970s scene, with Billie Jean (Emma Stone) already making history and Bobby (Steve Carell) largely sidelined. She’s making waves as a player and as a champion of women’s rights, including equal pay, and earning plaudits from the likes of President Nixon. Bobby seems to be living off his indulgent wealthy wife (Elisabeth Shue), a frozen smiler right out of Stepford, and spending time on idle in a fancy office. Mostly, Billie Jean is winning while Bobby is keeping boredom at bay.The directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton make these early scenes pop, cramming characters and information into Billie Jean and Bobby’s separate realities. Billie Jean’s is livelier, more engaging, partly because there’s more at stake and because she’s surrounded by chummy, pleasurably prickly women like Rosie Casals (Natalie Morales) and Gladys Heldman (a tangy Sarah Silverman), the founder of Tennis World magazine. Together with seven other top female players, these three form a feminist revolt called the Virginia Slims tour, a women’s pro circuit that sets out to combat the gross inequalities that defined professional (open) tennis since its advent in 1968.As the sunny, sporty feminists stake their rightful claim — holding press conferences, drumming up support, winning and winning some more — a rather dark, clubbier male world comes into view. A gambler, Bobby watches Billie Jean on TV but hangs with masters of the universe, male cigar chompers and scotch swirlers who think nothing of betting away a Rolls-Royce. It looks like a lethal bore, as does Bobby’s home, where he plays with his young son under a conspicuously large and looming portrait of his wife. By the time Bobby is challenging Billie Jean to play it almost seems as if he were willing himself into the arms — or at least company — of this other woman.It takes a while for them to meet on the court, partly because Billie Jean initially turns Bobby down. So instead, he takes on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), the Australian champion who becomes the movie’s female heavy. (The real Ms. Court has played that role off screen for her views on same-sex marriage and homosexuality, which she’s branded “a lust for the flesh.”) In a well-publicized faceoff soon called the Mother’s Day Massacre, Bobby defeats Margaret, a loss that Billie Jean feels she needs to correct. It’s game on, though with complications, including Billie Jean’s revelatory attraction to another woman, a hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough).Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton handle the many moving parts in Simon Beaufoy’s busy script smoothly as they toggle between intimate moments and public events, and set Billie Jean’s bedroom sighs off against Bobby’s heat-seeking braggadocio. There’s a lot to follow and a great deal to look at, including an atmospherically embellished past that turns the movie into a veritable wayback machine of amusing and amusingly unfortunate colors and choices. (The director of photography is Linus Sandgren; the production designer is Judy Becker.) There are plaid jackets and flirty minis, sideburns and shags, harvest-gold drapes and rooms perilously fogged in by cigarette smoke.A revolution can be tough to squeeze into two hours, but “Battle of the Sexes” manages it mostly by skipping along its handsome surfaces. The film repeatedly announces that there’s a lot at stake here, but without much urgency or sting. Bobby’s sexist pronouncements are outrageous, but his stunts are so absurd and self-serving that they’re hard to take seriously. And while Mr. Carell bounces and sags persuasively, the characterization is finally so soft that Bobby comes off as more needy and pathetic than threatening. The better foil and villain is a tennis promoter, Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman), one of those men who never bothers to hide his contempt for women.Billie Jean faces down Kramer at one point, speaking feminist truth to power: “It’s when we want a little bit of what you’ve got,” she says, “that’s what you can’t stand.” It’s a solid gotcha moment, but the reason it works as well as it does is its low-key realism, which underscores the absolute ordinariness of the sexism she’s calling out. Ms. Stone handles the scene exactly right, letting you see the tremor of indignation while keeping righteousness in view yet also in check. She’s unsurprisingly good and often moving, although the best thing about the performance is that Ms. Stone hasn’t been asked to play the girl who seduces us with big eyes and a smile. Billie Jean is a woman, and that’s a win.","Emma Stone, Steve Carell, Andrea Riseborough, Natalie Morales","$12,552,907","UK, USA","Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris","Biography, Comedy, Drama",English,73,The true story of the 1973 tennis match between World number one Billie Jean King and ex-champ and serial hustler Bobby Riggs.,PG-13,Fox Searchlight Pictures,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Sep 2017,121 min,Battle of the Sexes,Simon Beaufoy,2017,6.7,"37,099","[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '85%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '73/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",battle of the sexes,Battle of the Sexes,Fox Searchlight,2567.0,11.0,27.0,95.0,12598957.0,70.0,17500.0

His “All the Real Girls” (2003) and “Snow Angels” (2007) brought acute, cleareyed, compassionate consideration to trauma and tragedy as they affect intimate relationships. Unlike those pictures, though, “Stronger” carries a separate weight. It’s also about an actual galvanic event in recent American history.“Stronger” is the story of Jeff Bauman, a resident of Chelmsford, Mass., who lost both his legs above the knee in the terrorist bombings of the Boston Marathon in 2013.The movie, based on Mr. Bauman’s autobiography, begins with a depiction of him as a relatively amiable screw-up. Played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who’s almost a decade older than Mr. Bauman was at the time of the events shown, the character is nevertheless a convincing man-child. After making a grisly mess of a chicken-roasting task at the Costco where he works, Jeff repairs to his local, where he drinks and curses and makes moon-eyes at his ex-girlfriend Erin (Tatiana Maslany), a rather more directed soul who’s popped in to collect donations for her marathon run. Seizing on a notion to win her back, Jeff hand-letters a sign to brandish near the race’s finish line. He sees one of the bombers moments before the explosion that costs him his legs.For Mr. Bauman and his milieu, Mr. Green forgoes the standard Hollywood clichés about boisterous, hard-drinking, “politically incorrect” working-class Bostonians in favor of characters who are far, far, far more boisterous, hard-drinking and “politically incorrect.” It’s kind of terrifying. For instance, Jeff’s mother, Patty, in an astounding turn by Miranda Richardson, is a slovenly, resentful, egocentric drunk who frequently prioritizes her hangovers over Jeff’s physical rehabilitation appointments. For all that, the movie itself never judges its people.“Stronger” takes more artistic risks than any other American-made “inspired by true events” picture I can recall. The emotions and situations depicted, as Jeff struggles with PTSD, his immobility, his relationship with Erin and his hometown-hero status (which he believes to be completely unearned), are raw, sometimes desperate. A scene late in the film in which Jeff begs not to be abandoned is played at such a high pitch that it flirts with, then transcends, bathos.But as it approaches the two-hour mark, the movie seems to wake to the fact that it has to live up to its title. Then “Stronger” rushes through what screenwriting gurus call the “redemptive arc,” with little concern for just how its lead character makes the life changes that enable him to face his responsibilities. And in that respect, it brings the viewer up short.","Jake Gyllenhaal, Tatiana Maslany, Miranda Richardson, Richard Lane Jr.","&pound;4,192,426",USA,David Gordon Green,"Biography, Drama",English,76,"Stronger is the inspiring real life story of Jeff Bauman, an ordinary man who captured the hearts of his city and the world to become a symbol of hope after surviving the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.",R,Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",29 Sep 2017,119 min,Stronger,"John Pollono (screenplay by), Jeff Bauman (based on the book ""Stronger"" by), Bret Witter (based on the book ""Stronger"" by)",2017,7,"27,801","[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '92%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '76/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",stronger,Stronger,Roadside Attractions,348.0,-24.0,8.0,44.0,4211129.0,70.0,17500.0

What if his paintings, with their wild colors and vibrant brush strokes, had been able to move? And what if the bullet that killed him had been fired by someone else?A long and arduous labor of love by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, the film turns van Gogh’s work into an unusual kind of biopic. Using tens of thousands of oil paintings commissioned from scores of artists, the filmmakers transform famous works of modern art into a hypnotic and beguiling cartoon. The people van Gogh rendered on canvas — the provincial French functionaries, doctors, barmaids and farmers immortalized on museum walls — are brought to uncanny life, with the voices of professional actors, some of them well known.They participate in a meandering detective story. Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), the layabout son of a village postmaster (Chris O’Dowd), is instructed by his father to deliver a letter to Vincent’s brother Theo. Armand travels to Paris and then to Auvers-sur-Oise, the northern French town where Vincent died, leaving behind contradictory memories among the people he painted in his final years. They recall a passionate, hard-working artist, but not always the tormented, suicidal genius of legend.That legend has been sustained by earlier movies, notably Vincente Minnelli’s rumbustious “Lust for Life” (with Kirk Douglas as van Gogh) and Robert Altman’s more cerebral “Vincent & Theo” (starring Tim Roth and Paul Rhys as the brothers).Vincent himself (Robert Gulaczyk) is a more elusive presence in “Loving Vincent,” since most of its action is posthumous and self-portraits make up a relatively small part of his oeuvre. There are flashbacks, but the painter is evoked mainly through the dialogue of the other characters, as if he were the Maltese Falcon.The principal mystery is the stuff of police procedural, as Armand doggedly tries to reconstruct van Gogh’s final weeks and shed light on the circumstances of his death. How miserable was he, and why? What secrets did he harbor? What enemies had he made?The questions are interesting, but not quite sufficiently dramatized to sustain “Loving Vincent” for its full length. As the story limps and drags, the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film’s innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade. But its charm never quite wears off, for reasons summed up in the title.","Douglas Booth, Josh Burdett, Holly Earl, Robin Hodges","$6,388,510","Poland, UK, USA","Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman","Animation, Biography, Crime",English,62,"In a story depicted in oil painted animation, a young man comes to the last hometown of painter Vincent van Gogh to deliver the troubled artist's final letter and ends up investigating his final days there.",PG-13,Good Deed Entertainment,"[{'Value': '7.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Sep 2017,94 min,Loving Vincent,"Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman, Jacek Dehnel",2017,7.8,"33,000","[{'Value': '7.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '84%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '62/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",loving vincent,,,,,,,,,

And this is the second movie in 20 years in which Queen Victoria, played by Judi Dench, has a life-enhancing relationship with a man not of her station. This movie, “Victoria and Abdul,” directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Lee Hall, goes 1997’s “Mrs. Brown” one better in the Relevant to Contemporary Concerns department by depicting a friendship between the second-longest-reigning monarch of England and an Indian Muslim.“Based on real events … mostly,” reads a text at the movie’s opening. Queen Victoria’s first encounters with Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), an Indian functionary sent to Britain to present her with a ceremonial coin, are in comedic scenes that lampoon the pomp of her court. The material is broad, and funny. The Queen is struck by Abdul’s bearing and handsomeness, and soon enough is receiving him in private audiences and having him tutor her in Urdu. He becomes her “munshi” (teacher) and his presence in her life invigorates her. Much to the displeasure of her actual court, including her son and heir “Bertie” (a.k.a. Edward VII), played with a beard and fiercely indignant eyebrows by Eddie Izzard.In the shift from comedy to drama the movie goes wobbly. The narrative of cross-cultural understanding by way of individual affinity is a comforting but ultimately dubious one. The notion of Queen Victoria as the most progressive figure of the Victorian age is also peculiar. But this is a handsomely packaged collection of such notions, and will provide genteel entertainment to those of a mind to swallow them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And while it affects an estimated 1 million Americans and 17 million globally, those with the condition are often dismissed as suffering from psychosomatic disorders.If nothing else, “Unrest,” by Jennifer Brea, demonstrates just how debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, can be. Ms. Brea, herself a victim, was a well-traveled Ph.D. student at Harvard who fell ill after a high fever in 2011. Along with exhaustion, she experienced loss of muscle control, the inability to speak coherently, pain, and extreme sensitivity to light and noise. Specialists at first concluded that she was dehydrated or stressed; one even suggested a delayed reaction to some childhood trauma that she might not recall.In trying to understand chronic fatigue syndrome, Ms. Brea found other sufferers online and includes some of their stories here — a young Englishwoman bedridden for eight years, a Danish girl kept against her will in a psychiatric hospital for three years. Other interviews lightly sketch the history of the medical response to the syndrome, and how utterly insufficient it seems to be. Research money is only a small fraction, the film says, of that for multiple sclerosis, a condition afflicting roughly half as many Americans.Mainly, though, “Unrest” is a video diary and, as such, is not always easy to watch. Ms. Brea bravely spares very little in showing how the disease literally leveled her life — at times leaving her crawling the floor — and strained her marriage. The film is also not vested in an upbeat ending. Rather, it powerfully insists on giving a voice to victims whose greatest challenge, apart from their symptoms, is surmounting a world of indifference.","Corri English, Marisa Petroro, Ben Livingston, Abner Genece",N/A,USA,Jason Todd Ipson,"Horror, Thriller",English,N/A,A young pathology med student suspects that the spirit of a dead cadaver in the hospital morgue where she works is killing off all those who handle or desecrate the body.,R,Freestyle Releasing,"[{'Value': '5.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",24 Oct 2007,88 min,Unrest,"Chris Billett (screenplay), Jason Todd Ipson (screenplay)",2006,5,"7,300","[{'Value': '5.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",unrest,,,,,,,,,

While the movie climaxes with preparations for Gaga’s strangely spectacular 2017 Super Bowl halftime show, it mostly chronicles the artist at work in 2016 on a project that would ostensibly present her “unplugged,” so to speak.That would be her album “Joanne,” which, she tells the writer Darryl Pinckney in a disarming scene here, was inspired by an aunt who died before this artist was born as Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta. (As Mr. Pinckney noted in his piece, for The Times’s T Magazine, Gaga was named in part for her.) Besides baring a heretofore-unseen part of her artistic soul, the movie finds her coping with heartache and physical ailments. While it’s possible that the director and cinematographer Chris Moukarbel is good at withholding unflattering material, Gaga comes off well, and credibly so: intelligent, an accomplished craftswoman, a well-mannered collaborator and boss.She does not inhabit the best of all possible worlds, though, for all her privilege. Because Madonna is such an obvious antecedent (and she is mentioned here, specifically with respect to the tsoris surrounding Gaga’s reputedly Madonna-derived song “Born This Way”), this movie is bound to be compared to 1991’s “Truth or Dare.” But these are very different movies, because their subjects are very different people. While Madonna was shown as the happy ringleader of a media circus, “Five Foot Two” depicts an artist and idol in a peculiar isolation. Even when other people are in the frame, Gaga often seems sadly but necessarily alone.","Sandra Amador, Michael Bearden, Tony Bennett, BloodPop",N/A,USA,Chris Moukarbel,"Documentary, Biography, Music",English,63,This documentary goes behind the scenes with pop provocateur Lady Gaga as she releases a bold new album and prepares for her Super Bowl halftime show.,TV-MA,Netflix,"[{'Value': '7.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Sep 2017,100 min,Gaga: Five Foot Two,N/A,2017,7.1,"7,351","[{'Value': '7.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '75%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '63/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",gaga: five foot two,,,,,,,,,

Problems arise immediately when an expected engineering position disappears in a downsizing company, leaving Sami with a temporary job as a draftsman and a visa that’s set to expire in 30 days.With a likable cast and a wholesome message about the true meaning of success, “The Tiger Hunter” might balk at the harsher details of immigrant life, but it has a generosity of spirit that lifts everyone up. Surrounding Sami with a strong support group of fellow South Asian professionals working menial jobs, the director, Lena Khan (who wrote the script with Sameer Gardezi, and whose own grandfather was a tiger hunter), knows exactly the story she wants to tell.She is helped immensely by Mr. Pudi, whose quirky performance as a television-obsessed student on the NBC comedy “Community” was a consistent delight. It also gave him an ease with ensemble work that allows him to blend with other actors instead of sucking attention. The result is an endearingly old-fashioned comedy, not just in its style and the sweetness of its plot, but also in its bright-eyed optimism about immigrant opportunities. These days, it can be hard to remember that for those who dreamed large, America once seemed like a soft place to fall.","Danny Pudi, Rizwan Manji, Jon Heder, Karen David","$39,553",USA,Lena Khan,"Comedy, Drama",English,66,"A young Indian man relocates to 1970s Chicago to become an engineer, but when his job falls through, resorts to an elaborate charade with misfit friends in order to woo his childhood sweetheart.",NOT RATED,Sneaky Sneaky Films,"[{'Value': '5.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Sep 2017,94 min,The Tiger Hunter,"Sameer Gardezi, Lena Khan",2016,5.7,523,"[{'Value': '5.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '76%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '66/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the tiger hunter,,,,,,,,,

His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were, five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan, a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks.Soon enough, the Wegos awwived, and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway, a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion, winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there, and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity.This is especially disappointing given the conceptual wit, visual flair and bonkers imagination of “The Lego Movie” and the sweet silliness of “The Lego Batman Movie.” “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” directed by Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher and Bob Logan from a script with an army of credited authors, attaches itself to some of the tropes and images of Asian action cinema with sloppy affection. Mr. Chan, who voices a wise and venerable teacher in addition to playing the wise and venerable shopkeeper, doesn’t really belong to the ninja genre. But neither do the young fighters who protect the city of Ninjago from an evil four-armed warlord named Garmadon, voiced by Justin Theroux. They prefer big, noisy machines to stealth, guile and swordsmanship.Garmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun?Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor; their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired, cynical, sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery.A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs, freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation, and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies.We’re also, at least in the eyes of the committee that issued this strategy memo disguised as a movie, eager to hear the voices of cool people we watch on television. Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City,” Fred Armisen of “Portlandia” and Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley” (and also “The Big Sick”) are on sidekick duty here, to no memorable effect. Ms. Jacobson’s character, the only girl in the six-ninja squad, barely rises to the level of tokenism.“She’s a girl and a ninja! Can she have it all?” a voice-over asks sardonically, trying to make a self-conscious joke at the expense of the movie’s own imaginative limitations. “You fellas need to inform yourselves on where we’re at culturally,” the lady ninja retorts. It’s a good line, but also one that the writers and directors — fellas to a man — might have taken a bit more to heart. Or maybe they did, and this is just where we’re at culturally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like its 2015 predecessor, this latest visit with the British agents-cum-Savile Row tailors swings for the fences without caring whose head — or torso, or dignity — is shredded en route. Even if it belongs to Sir Elton.In a plot as sloppy and extended as over-washed elastic, the singer’s cameo as the feathered-and-sequined pet of a drug-dealing villain named Poppy (Julianne Moore) is a ludicrous highlight. A homesick sociopath, Poppy has styled her Cambodian lair to resemble Eisenhower-era America, including a diner where those who displease her are churned into Hamburger Helper. (So that’s what the first film was lacking: cannibalism.)Bigger, longer and — at an interminable 141 minutes — apparently uncut, “Circle” is an emotionally sterile lark, its wounds inflicted with brolly and bullwhip, a smirk and a shrug. Obliterating all but two Kingsmen in the opening reel, the story (by the director, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman) forces the leftovers into the protective arms of their American counterparts, cowboy spies with rolling hips and code names like Tequila and Champagne. Their presence, led by a strutting Channing Tatum, lends the action a homoerotic glaze that I choose to believe is intentional.Yet in a movie as happy to resurrect characters as rub them out, nothing is of consequence, and the glibness grows numbing. As does the cocky masculinity: This is, after all, a man’s world, and women had better get behind or beneath them if they want to survive.

Oh, it’s pretty enough, in the superficially embellished style of a perfume ad or fashion video — the gifted Finnish cinematographer Peter Flinckenberg virtually empties his bag of tricks. But it’s more lacking in substance than a yard of silk chiffon.The title refers to the psychological panic engendered by being lost in a forest (here played by the giant redwoods in Humboldt County, California), but Theresa (Kirsten Dunst) isn’t physically disoriented, just mentally unmoored. Having helped her sick mother die using a spiked spliff, Theresa, who works in a medical-marijuana dispensary, descends into a detached reverie of hallucinatory grief. Neither her boyfriend (Joe Cole, underemployed to the point of effacement) nor her boss (a miscast Pilou Asbaek) can reach her.What follows is less a consideration of the fallout from an act of euthanasia than a succession of disjointed, dreamlike scenes of Theresa listlessly caressing tree trunks and her mother’s shabby-chic furnishings. More than one person will die as she continues to mope and medicate, attired in a succession of lace-trimmed chemises. Yet no substantive conversation or hint of greater meaning pierces this gauzy void, which the Mulleavy sisters, whose fashion label is Rodarte, decorate by slapping butterflies or flowers on virtually every available surface.Filmmaking might be a natural sidestep for fashion designers — as Tom Ford has twice proven, though he had the foresight to use strong novels as building blocks — but “Woodshock” is a painterly bore. At their most basic level, movies are supposed to actually move; this one is as becalmed as its perpetually high heroine.","Kirsten Dunst, Joe Cole, Pilou Asbæk, Steph DuVall","$41,126",USA,"Kate Mulleavy, Laura Mulleavy","Drama, Thriller",English,39,"A haunted young woman spirals in the wake of profound loss, torn between her fractured emotional state and the reality-altering effects of a potent cannabinoid drug.",R,A24 Films,"[{'Value': '4.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",22 Sep 2017,100 min,Woodshock,"Kate Mulleavy, Laura Mulleavy",2017,4.3,"1,081","[{'Value': '4.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '25%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '39/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",woodshock,Woodshock,A24,454.0,65.0,9.0,50.0,42469.0,21.0,17451.0

It’s a fair enough question, not least because Brad is played by Ben Stiller, a frighteningly high-strung performer even at his mellowest. Mr. Stiller, lean as a greyhound and gray around the temples, occupies the volatile middle ground between decent fellow and abrasive jerk, between adequacy and failure. He’s a regular guy perpetually threatening to turn into that guy, embarrassing the rest of us by association.In “Brad’s Status,” Mike White’s astute, cringy and ultimately kindhearted new film, Mr. Stiller undergoes a midlife crisis that has less to do with restlessness or lust than with a dreadful loss of perspective. Brad, who runs a small nonprofit, lives in a handsome Craftsman-style house on a leafy Sacramento block. His wife, Melanie (Jenna Fischer), who works in state government, is patient and devoted. Troy (Austin Abrams), a rising high school senior, is an excellent student, a gifted musician and an all-around good kid. Brad lives in a soft pocket of the American dream. He should be counting his blessings, or at least checking his privilege.Instead, he dreams of the greener grass where his old college pals frolic, consumed with envy for their gilded, fast-track lives. As he and Troy prepare to head east for a tour of potential colleges — Brad, who went to Tufts, is amazed to learn that his son is Harvard material — he is seized by anxieties that quickly migrate from the practical to the existential. The question of whether he and Melanie will have enough money for Troy’s tuition gives way to a resentful reckoning with his peers. How come he doesn’t have as much as they do?These four men occupy a prime parcel of professional, personal and actual real estate. Nick (Mr. White), is a Hollywood director whose house has recently been featured on the cover of a glossy shelter rag. Jason (Luke Wilson) is a hedge-fund mogul with a bevy of blond kids and a private jet. Billy (Jemaine Clement), having made a fortune in tech, now lives in polyamorous retirement on a beach in Maui. Craig (Michael Sheen) has parlayed a political career into best-selling authorship and television celebrity.What do they have that Brad lacks? Where did he go wrong? Why does he only rate a worthless silver airline rewards card, instead of gold or platinum? He ruminates on these and related matters in long passages of voice-over narration, brought back to reality by the ringing of his cellphone or the needs of his son.Brad also reconnects with his old friends — three of the four, at least — who drop hints that they may have problems of their own. Everybody does. And Mr. White is committed to giving everyone a fair hearing. He specializes in exquisitely awkward scenes made more so by his evenhanded sympathy. In one especially acute moment, Brad unburdens himself to a Harvard undergraduate named Ananya (Shazi Raja) who is a friend of Troy’s from back home. Rather than singing harmony with Brad’s white man’s blues, she rebukes him for his unthinking white male entitlement. “You’re 50 years old and you still think the world was made for you,” she marvels.She has a point. So does he. His angst is real, as are the gradations of social hierarchy that cause it. But in the bigger picture, his misery is trivial. Mr. White could easily have loaded the satiric dice, emphasizing Brad’s Gen-X self-absorption or Ananya’s millennial self-righteousness, but he suspends judgment, leaving the viewer hanging in an exquisitely uncomfortable limbo. What are we supposed to think? We’re supposed to think for ourselves.And “Brad’s Status” at its best is genuinely thought-provoking. As a writer, television creator and director — his résumé includes “Beatriz at Dinner,” “Year of the Dog” and the HBO series “Enlightened” — Mr. White has honed a comic sensibility that avoids cruelty and minimizes exaggeration. He is attuned to the political implications of individual behavior and also to those aspects of experience that can’t be politicized. His characters are bundles of contradictory impulses and qualities. They are admirable and awful, full of idealism and full of themselves, weird and entirely familiar.Sometimes you might wish he pushed them harder. “Brad’s Status,” a worthy addition to the burgeoning genre of empty-nest movies, smooths more feathers than it ruffles. In spite of Mr. Stiller’s displays of doubt and discomfort, the movie protects him from humiliation and finds a safe space for Brad’s bruised ego. There is something a little disappointing about this, but also something honest, since the movie’s message is that what looks like disappointment should be embraced as the only real happiness there is.","Ben Stiller, Austin Abrams, Jenna Fischer, Michael Sheen","$2,029,594",USA,Mike White,"Comedy, Drama, Music",English,71,A father takes his son to tour colleges on the East Coast and meets up with an old friend who makes him feel inferior about his life's choices.,R,Amazon Studios,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",15 Sep 2017,102 min,Brad's Status,Mike White,2017,6.5,"11,225","[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '82%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '71/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",brad's status,,,,,,,,,

We know his type pretty well. He possesses all the necessary skills but lacks the discipline that his employers supposedly demand. Conventional wisdom in his profession says that it’s never personal, but for a guy like Rapp it’s always personal. He may have a job to do, but he is also driven by longstanding grudges and unsettled scores. I’m not saying he’s a cliché, but at the end of the day, it is what it is.The movie, directed by Michael Cuesta from a script by a team of blue-chip writers (Stephen Schiff and Michael Finch are credited, along with Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz), shows more skill than personality. There are fights and chases, punctuated by tense meetings and bouts of intense laptop and cellphone use. We hop from one camera-friendly hot spot to another before settling in Rome for the final round of fights and chases.Since this is in effect an origin story, a certain amount of time needs to be spent on explaining how Rapp arrived at his vocation and showing how he was trained in it. The explaining is perfunctory: Terrorists killed his fiancée on a beach in Ibiza the day he proposed to her. The training is more elaborate, since it involves Michael Keaton.Twenty-five years post-“Batman,” Mr. Keaton has re-emerged as the go-to wise, grizzled veteran of whatever you need him to be a wise, grizzled veteran of: car racing (“Need for Speed”); the newspaper business (“Spotlight”); Hollywood itself (“Birdman”). Here he plays Stan Hurley, who is putting together a top-secret black-ops program called Orion. Mitch, who had been planning a freelance revenge on his girl’s killer, has been recruited by the deputy C.I.A. director, Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan), who sees a perfect fit between the young hothead and the grizzled veteran.She’s not wrong. There is some first-rate hardass mentoring from Hurley and some spirited defiance from Rapp against a backdrop of rogue Iranian nuclear shenanigans. There are also some perhaps not-fully-professional glances exchanged between Rapp and Annika (Shiva Negar), a colleague with a shadowy back story. In a Ludlumesque switcheroo, the geopolitical tensions are a bit of a red herring. The real enemy is a fellow known as Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), whose mentor Hurley used to be.It is personal, then. It’s also decent fun, in the leathery, businesslike, self-satisfied manner of this kind of movie, which soothes the hurt places in the male ego with sentiment strategically disguised as toughness. So far there are 16 Mitch Rapp novels in print — the series, begun by Vince Flynn, has been kept going by Kyle Mills after Mr. Flynn’s death — and therefore plenty more of this kind of work to be done.","Dylan O'Brien, Charlotte Vega, Christopher Bomford, Chris Webster","$34,449,582",USA,Michael Cuesta,"Action, Thriller","English, Spanish, Arabic, Polish, Turkish, Italian, Persian",45,"After the death of his girlfriend at the hands of terrorists, Mitch Rapp is drawn into the world of counterterrorism, mentored by tough-as-nails former U.S. Navy S.E.A.L.

With the help of her longtime collaborator and co-writer, Peter Kjenaas, and the first-time director Taron Lexton, Ms. Cartwright creates a Felliniesque fantasy of her own.In the movie, Lucy (Ksenia Solo) is a sheltered 20-year-old who inherited her mother’s idealistic view of romance and appreciation of feel-good movies. After her mother (Maria Bello) falls ill, Lucy finds solace at a festival of Fellini films and discovers movies with dark endings and sexual scenes that she had never seen before. She resolves to find the man of her cinematic dreams in Italy.Lucy, whose wide-eyed naïveté is modeled after Giulietta Masina’s character in “La Strada,” isn’t the only reference to Fellini’s movies. “In Search of Fellini” is overflowing with characters, locations and visual cues to the director’s classics, like “La Dolce Vita,” “8 ½” and “Nights of Cabiria.” Fans who refer to Fellini as Il Maestro may delight in these references, but several cues and cameos are followed by a scene or poster of the cited movie, so as not to exclude the rest of the audience.Fellini used nostalgia to point out something about ourselves; Mr. Lexton uses it to remind us of Fellini’s films.

But for Manolo Blahnik, maker of some of the most sublime women’s footwear of the past four decades, she drops the lenses and lets her eyes, and feelings, show.Mr. Blahnik inspires this warmth by dint of his shoes and also his character, which is eccentrically patrician, starry eyed, elegant. (He wears the hell out of a lilac suit.) He’s a man who describes wisteria — the word, but presumably also the plant — as “so Olympic, it’s so hedonistic in a way.”But this film, directed by the fashion writer and editor Michael Roberts, doesn’t aspire beyond embrace. It rushes through Mr. Blahnik’s biography, dwelling on pop-culture moments and blandly ecstatic celebrity testimonials (not counting the uproarious André Leon Talley, who insists Mr. Blahnik is “up there with Baudelaire”). It also leans heavily at times on recreated footage of Mr. Blahnik’s childhood, as well as on a bizarre scene imagining a 1930s African society party in which a white woman emerges from a gorilla costume.There is little accounting of his inner life, or for that matter of his creative gifts, which are quite exquisite. And though there are some cleverly conceived but blindingly lighted scenes of Blahnik shoes in nature, or nestled amid sculpture or architecture, there is nothing systematic to the way the shoes are discussed or filmed. In a scene puzzlingly late in the film, Mr. Blahnik, who apparently still makes samples by hand, walks through his factory and finesses a sensuous heel out of a stump of wood. More of that would have made this confection about a radiant man into something sturdier.","Manolo Blahnik, David Bailey, Mary Beard, Lucy Burley","$39,504",UK,Michael Roberts,"Documentary, Biography, Drama",English,52,"An in-depth portrait of MANOLO BLAHNIK, self-confessed 'cobbler' and the man regarded by most influential fashion figures as 'the best shoe-maker of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Mr. Ford had gone there after a dispute over a repair and confronted Mr. Reilly about an insult that was said to have been made earlier to Mr. Ford’s mother. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Reilly, a decision that staggered Mr. Ford’s loved ones.Though questions of race and justice are raised, Yance Ford more often examines how he and the rest of his middle-class family dealt, or refused to deal, with the tragedy. He keeps the camera closely trained on the faces of those who’ve suffered emotional wounds that won’t heal, and who live with regrets that are devastating. That includes himself.The effect is intense and elegiac, even as the pace veers toward the overly deliberate, and as Mr. Reilly and some essential witnesses aren’t interviewed or approached by the filmmaker; no explanation for this omission is given.Were “Strong Island” a strict procedural, that exclusion would be more glaring. Yet this potent film gives equal weight to complex emotions as well as bare facts. In the same way, it’s not just the story of a man’s death, but also a study of the aftermath.","Yance Ford, Harvey Walker, Kevin Myers, Lauren Ford",N/A,"USA, Denmark",Yance Ford,Documentary,English,86,"Examining the violent death of the filmmaker's brother and the judicial system that allowed his killer to go free, this documentary interrogates murderous fear and racialized perception, ...",TV-MA,Netflix,"[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",15 Sep 2017,107 min,Strong Island,N/A,2017,6.4,"2,534","[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '100%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '86/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",strong island,,,,,,,,,

But his first fiction feature shows he has not mastered directing.,"Ben Barenholtz has been a film distributor, exhibitor and producer, who has influenced the careers of David Lynch, John Sayles and Joel and Ethan Coen. He has even been credited with inventing the concept of the midnight movie at Chelsea’s long-gone Elgin Theater, which he ran. Alas, the self-financed “Alina,” his first fiction feature as a director, looks like the work of someone just starting out.This fish-out-of-water story goes to predictable places in unconvincing ways. Alina (Darya Ekamasova), a Russian with a passion for photography, travels to New York seeking her father, whom she’s never met. (Not wanting to alarm her mother, she pretends she’s going to Cuba.)Alina soon discovers the city is full of sharks. She moves in with an old friend (Anna Vlads) and her two roommates, not realizing that when they bring her to a party, they expect her to have sex with the rich hosts. When she goes to work for a nightclub owner (Grisha Reydler) who has helped with her search, she is slow to realize that the job involves more than serving champagne.Although the internet and cellphones exist in the movie, there’s a dated quality to the premise. Even if Alina’s only clue is an old photograph of a man who may be her father, tracking down the owners of the building in the photo — which has a visible address — seems like a task for search engines. And if you were to go the route of simply finding someone who knows someone, repeatedly, as Alina does, it would probably involve less coincidence.","Gina Lollobrigida, Amedeo Nazzari, Doris Dowling, Juan de Landa",N/A,Italy,Giorgio Pastina,Drama,Italian,N/A,A woman takes her ill husband's place in a smuggling ring and steals the heart of his partner.,N/A,Acta Film,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",06 Aug 1950,90 min,Alina,"Carlo Duse (scenario), Faldella (subject & scenario), Giorgio Pastina (scenario)",1950,6.5,31,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",alina,,,,,,,,,

She has made an engrossing, dynamically shot movie that moves with real fluidity and complexity. Yet she also succumbs to familiar ideological pitfalls. The standard complaints about cultural appropriation, point of view and the ethics of aestheticizing war all apply.The movie’s source is Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir of her childhood under the Khmer Rouge, which captured Phnom Penh when she was 5 and ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Ms. Jolie announces her respect for the material almost immediately by putting the titles in Khmer as well as in English, only to undercut that gesture with a slick, scene-setting montage, glibly scored to the Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil.” The sequence juxtaposes footage of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and others with imagery of the United States’ bombing raids in Cambodia.Still, the stab at an energetic overture isn’t totally unwelcome, since the previous war movies Ms. Jolie directed — “In the Land of Blood and Honey” (2011) and “Unbroken” (2014) — were both earnest slogs. “First They Killed My Father” is never that.The story proper begins in Phnom Penh, where the young Loung (Sreymoch Sareum) lives comfortably with her middle-class family, which is loyal to the outgoing government. Her father (Kompheak Phoeung) is a captain in the military police. A moment in which Loung reaches for the sky, trying to touch a helicopter overhead, recalls Steven Spielberg’s “Empire of the Sun,” a movie that, with its child’s-eye view of war as a time of horror and wonder, might well have served as a template.The screenplay — Ms. Jolie and Ms. Ung are credited as a writing team — manages the tricky task of providing enough information to push the film along while only rarely straying beyond what a child might comprehend. Loung soon discovers that she and her family, with whom she’s been forced to evacuate the capital, won’t be returning home after the promised three days. She learns that she will work in service of Angkar (the name for the Khmer Rouge leadership); surrender personal property (foreign goods, in particular, are seen as symbols of an imperialist agenda); and be separated piecemeal from her parents and siblings.Ms. Jolie sparked an outcry for a casting process that, as recounted in a Vanity Fair interview, struck many as exploitative. The article said that Ms. Jolie was looking for children who had experienced hardship, and that for the lead role, the casting directors created a game in which children would steal money off a table and then lie when caught. (Ms. Jolie said her quotations were taken out of context; Vanity Fair stood by the story.) Whatever her process, she has found an expressive star in Ms. Sareum, who carries much of the film without words.Whether the movie’s perspective is truly Loung’s is another matter. Ms. Jolie, working with the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, shoots the character’s dream sequences in garish, supersaturated colors. The elaborate Steadicam shots and pervasive images of light streaming through foliage seem incongruously punch-drunk for a film that concerns mass starvation and death. Even a moment in which children training to fight stand completely still in a murky river during a downpour seems conceived more for its compositional possibilities than dramatic effect. Viewers familiar with the work of one of the producers, Rithy Panh, a director who has made movies about his own youth under the Khmer Rouge (including “The Missing Picture”), may find the rampant prettification poorly considered.The most simultaneously stunning and appalling shot shows a high-angle view of Loung treading carefully through a mine-strewn forest as another woman runs through it — only to step on a mine and be killed. The moment captures everything that’s right and wrong with “First They Killed My Father”: It is gorgeous and suspenseful, and it rushes heedlessly into dangerous terrain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Mother!,"Review: ‘Mother!’ Is a Divine Comedy, Dressed as a Psychological Thriller",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/movies/mother-review-jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky.html,2017-09-15,2017-09-13,"Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem portray a couple in Darren Aronofsky’s film, a religious allegory with visual wit and dexterous camera work.","The couple live in a grand, oddly-shaped Victorian house in the middle of a tree-ringed meadow — less a McMansion than a perennial fixer-upper. The work of home improvement, of literal homemaking, you might say, falls to the young wife. Her husband, who has been around longer than she has, is absorbed in his work. He’s a poet, and the torment of creation distracts him from her needs, at times rendering him all but oblivious to her presence. Neither partner is given a name. They are played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. The movie is called “Mother!” The first line of dialogue is “Baby?”The missus walks around in her nightgown, lonely and confused, especially when her hubby starts bringing home guests. “Who are these people?” she asks him. She never receives an adequate answer — they are big fans of the poet’s work, though — and for a while her bewilderment is ours as well. But we, at least, are in a position to analyze the abundantly available clues and figure out who everybody is, the poet and his lady included. Or if not quite who they are, then at least what they represent. Because though this extravagant conversation piece of a movie, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, feints toward psychological thriller territory and spends a delicious half-hour or so in the realm of domestic farce, it plants its flag defiantly on the wind-swept peak of religious (and ecological) allegory.I don’t mean this in the vague, Superman-is-really-a-messiah-figure term paper sense of the word. At a certain point — it will vary according to your Sunday school attendance or what you remember from freshman English — you will find yourself in possession of the key to the analogical storage room where the Real Meaning resides. Up until that point, you might have thought this was a marital melodrama set in a nightmarish version of a ’50s academic marriage. When Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, you might mistake “Mother!” for a savage, scrambled “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” adaptation. But then, sometime between the first violent death and the collapse of the kitchen sink, you realize that something else is going on.Here I must confess a different kind of puzzlement. Is there such a thing as interpretive spoiler? Is it wrong to reveal a movie’s conceit, rather than elements of its story? Ordinarily, such questions would be absurd, but Mr. Aronofsky ingeniously braids his movie’s hermeneutic structure into its plot, making it hard to say what it’s about without revealing what happens. All of the suspense and most of the fun in “Mother!” — and don’t listen to anyone who natters on about how intense or disturbing it is; it’s a hoot! — has to do with the elaboration and execution of a central idea.Once you grasp that idea, you are left wondering just how far Mr. Aronofsky will go with it. The answer is all the way and then some — from Genesis to Revelation and back again. The house is referred to early in the film as “paradise”; Ms. Lawrence refers to a relatively minor mess as an “apocalypse.” These are more teasers than jokes, and the punch lines arrive with mesmerizing literalness. Holy Eucharist, Batman!Not that Mr. Aronofsky follows any known doctrinal path, any more than he did in “Noah,” which upset some believers by taking liberties with its scriptural source. “Mother!” casts a wider net, gathering influences from cinema — Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Gaspar Noé — from literature and, most strikingly, from painting. Mr. Aronofsky and his usual cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, conduct a master class in light, shadow and Renaissance art. Ms. Lawrence glows like an Italian Madonna, while the deep lines in Mr. Bardem’s face and the sorrowful cast of his eyes suggest El Greco. The infernal chaos of the climactic sequences are pure Hieronymus Bosch, updated for the age of Kristen Wiig and automatic weaponry.It falls to the actors to endow this highly symbolic, pictorially overloaded environment with a sense of human reality — with flesh and blood and feeling. Mr. Bardem, alpha male and omega man, is the kind of actor who can endow an abstraction with gravity and tenderness. (He did pretty much that in “No Country for Old Men.”) The enigmatic nature of his character in “Mother!” allows him to relax, to be playful and charismatic, and to disappear. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer bring a jolt of shtick and a whisper of camp, qualities that you may miss terribly when they depart.Ms. Lawrence, for her part, bears an impossible burden. In dramatic terms, she is a passive, reactive protagonist, a cipher and, in the strict sense of the word, an icon. Called upon to embody all of womankind — and a lot else besides — she is denied the chance to be human, and her blankness empties the film of emotional power.What it has, instead, is extravagant sensation and churning intellectual energy. Mr. Aronofsky is a virtuoso of mood and timing, a devoted student of form and technique straining to be a credible visionary. But as wild and provocative as his images can be, there is something missing — an element of strangeness, of difficulty, of the kind of inspiration that overrides mere cleverness.On the other hand, “Mother!” made me laugh harder and more frequently than just about any other movie I’ve seen this year. I don’t say this derisively. Mr. Aronofsky’s visual wit and dexterous, disciplined camera movements create frissons of comic terror. His gift for escalation — evident in the marvelous crescendo of frenzied action that occupies most of the movie’s second half — may be unmatched in his generation of filmmakers.It’s not clear that his gifts match his ambitions. He wants to be Kubrick, but maybe what we need is a new Blake Edwards. At a time when film comedy is mostly a verbal and psychical affair — the domain of writers and clowns — there is a dearth of funny directors with Mr. Aronofsky’s sophisticated chops. If he didn’t take himself so seriously, he could be a great comic filmmaker. But maybe “Mother!” proves that he already is.","Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer","$17,297,289",USA,Darren Aronofsky,"Drama, Horror, Mystery",English,75,"A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.",R,Paramount Pictures,"[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",15 Sep 2017,121 min,Mother!,Darren Aronofsky,2017,6.6,"137,166","[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '69%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '75/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",mother!,mother!,Paramount Pictures,8488.0,-17.0,106.0,80.0,17800004.0,42.0,17465.0

An American hunter welling up over the body of the lion he has just shot; a South African rhino breeder calmly sawing the horns off his helpless charges. The intimacy of the film’s images and the surprising candor of its participants are disarming: Whatever your initial response, be prepared to re-evaluate.Wading hip-deep into the moral, emotional and economic confluence of big-game hunting and wildlife conservation, the movie reveals a world where animals must pay for their keep or risk extinction. From a hunt in Namibia to a safari lodge in South Africa, from an animal control program in Zimbabwe to a Las Vegas convention hall, the narrative becomes only more complex and confounding. At any moment, whoever is onscreen — the hunter who believes he has a God-given right to shoot animals; the anti-poaching officer whose work is financed in part by the hunting industry; the poor villagers endangered by animals that the wealthy pay to kill — might challenge our assumptions and expose our ignorance.Layered, thoughtful and infinitely curious, “Trophy” is shot so simply and beautifully, and with such nonjudgmental calm, that it’s easy to miss the ingenuity of its construction. Intervening solely to offer the occasional devastating statistic, the filmmakers allow our perceptions to shift and slide with each new piece of information. Here, canny businessman and genuine animal lover share the same skin, and a high-end safari outfitter is no less concerned for his beasts than the most vehement anti-hunting activist.This blurring of lines is nowhere more pronounced than in the efforts of John Hume, the rhino breeder, to discourage illegal poaching by legalizing the sale of rhino horn. A profoundly polarizing and finally tragic figure, Mr. Hume opens himself for condemnation. But be careful: That moral high ground you’re standing on might not be as solid as you think.","Philip Glass, Christo Gomes, John Hume","&pound;19,744","UK, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, USA","Christina Clusiau, Shaul Schwarz",Documentary,English,80,"This in-depth look into the powerhouse industries of big-game hunting, breeding and wildlife conservation in the U.S. and Africa unravels the complex consequences of treating animals as commodities.",NOT RATED,The Orchard,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",08 Sep 2017,108 min,Trophy,N/A,2017,7.4,412,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '98%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '80/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",trophy,Trophy,The Orchard,51.0,31.0,1.0,51.0,21439.0,45.0,17461.0

By a logic at once elusive and meticulous, it is also, therefore, about the consequences of inaction. Moral indifference is an easy path, and it leads to other, graver sins, including cruelty and dishonesty. But the harder road of decency has its own traps and byways, as a young doctor named Jenny Davin discovers.Jenny, played with somber concentration by Adèle Haenel, is devoted to her profession and her patients. She is thorough and compassionate, scolding her intern (Olivier Bonnaud) for failing to keep his emotions in check and communicating clearly and efficiently with the mostly poor people who come to her office. On the verge of moving into a more prestigious position, she decides, almost impulsively, to stay where she is, and take over her retired mentor’s small general practice. It’s what she loves, and she is loved in return.But in the Dardennes’ moral universe the ways of love are never simple. Having established that Jenny is a good person, the film allows her what at first seems to be a trivial lapse. Late one evening, long after office hours have finished, the front buzzer sounds and Jenny decides to ignore it. (That buzzer and the functional ringtone on Jenny’s cellphone are the film’s principal sound effects and the closest thing it has to a musical score.) The next morning, a woman is found dead nearby, and security video identifies her as the person who had been at Jenny’s door.Not much else is known about her, and Jenny, in a fit of self-reproach, tries to compensate for her neglect by finding out what she can. As they often have before — in “The Son,” “The Child” and “Lorna’s Silence,” most notably — the Dardennes use techniques of suspense to pursue an ethical problem. And vice versa. Jenny, stubborn in the face of her own fear and the threats and evasions of the people she encounters, is equal parts detective and priest. She uses the promise of doctor-patient confidentiality, a secular version of the seal of confession, to coax out shameful secrets. She also burrows into a demimonde of poverty, desperation and crime that exists just beyond her waiting room and sometimes spills into it.“The Unknown Girl” is as tense as a police procedural, and as mysterious as a religious parable. It’s a Dardenne brothers film, in other words, shot with unassuming lyricism and an eye for everyday detail and full of modest, eloquent performances (including from Jérémie Renier, the star of “The Child.”) The brothers’ methods are austere, but not harsh. They are students of human cruelty and champions of the resistance to it. In their world — in our world, as their unforgettable films reveal it to us — there is no end of guilt, and just enough grace.","Adèle Haenel, Olivier Bonnaud, Jérémie Renier, Louka Minnella","$142,332","Belgium, France","Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne","Crime, Drama, Mystery",French,65,A female doctor gets obsessed with the case of a dead woman after learning that the woman had died shortly after having rung her door for help.,UNRATED,Sundance Selects,"[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",25 Aug 2017,113 min,The Unknown Girl,"Jean-Pierre Dardenne (screenplay), Luc Dardenne (screenplay)",2016,6.5,"5,498","[{'Value': '6.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '70%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '65/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the unknown girl,,,,,,,,,

As the movie opens on a bright spring day, he’s not up to much. He looks after a friend’s baby and won’t take money for it. He tools around Manhattan and Brooklyn on a bike. In a park, a group of Spanish-speaking women note his resemblance to an actor on an Argentine TV drama called “Rivales.” He shrugs it off with a nondenial-denial.Nico, played with unforced depth by Guillermo Pfening, actually is that actor. He’s in the United States because he’s tired of soap opera work (he’s also fleeing a failed love affair). He is promised a movie role in New York and doesn’t mind waiting tables while the production supposedly comes together.It’s emblematic of this film’s tone that the role falls through — putting his work visa situation into a bad bind — a half-hour into the movie. “Nobody’s Watching” addresses immigration issues head on, but it’s more about being set existentially adrift.Humiliations follow, including an encounter with an arrogant American film insider who bluntly tells Nico to darken his hair — his blond hair doesn’t exude stereotypical Latino vibes. His friendships suffer — the mother of the child he babysits for takes umbrage when he chats up a potential professional connection at her yoga class — as does his self-esteem after a fraught visit from a mentor who’s also a former lover.Ms. Solomonoff, an Argentine filmmaker based in New York, doesn’t fail to include scenes of stranger-in-a-strange-land exhilaration.

It is also, according to the interviewees in the film, a place where pollution has harmed the health of the populace. David Bouie, a pastor and activist on this issue who is the closest thing “Company Town” has to a principal figure, walks around a block and names the people who have had cancer. Barbara Bouie, his wife, says that she saw an ear, nose and throat specialist who blamed “the Crossett crud” for her health problems. His advice? Move.We hear from a chemist and environmental science experts who have nothing good to say about their findings in Crossett, and while watching a movie is probably a poor way to assess air and water quality, what we see of the waterways, land and smoke-filled sky certainly looks damning. (Newsweek and The New Yorker, among others, have reported on the claims.)Many residents, who have historically depended on the mill for employment, don’t have the means to leave, and the film argues that the pollution has been allowed to continue because regulators are susceptible to political influence.

So his central presence in “The Limehouse Golem,” a baroque Victorian whodunit set in London’s East End, is like a wink-wink signal that what we’re seeing is being played for laughs, not scares. Yet despite the lurid images and florid dialogue, this over-the-top adaptation of Peter Ackroyd’s 1994 novel takes itself very seriously indeed.Which can make the penny-dreadful plot even more giggle-icious. As Kildare, the dogged police inspector on the tail of a hyperactive serial killer, Mr. Nighy performs a symphony of sneers, squints and suspicious lip-pursing. Around Kildare, the public is baying for details of the splattery crimes. At the same time, the vaudeville star Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke, last seen in “Bates Motel”) is on trial for poisoning her husband. The narratives will converge, but not before traversing a louche landscape of sadomasochism and genital mutilation.Meanwhile, we watch Lizzie’s rise from street to stage and from abuse to applause, mentored by the cross-dressing comedian Dan Leno (a marvelous Douglas Booth). Marrying fact and fiction, Jane Goldman’s seamy screenplay is wildly overstuffed; but the director, Juan Carlos Medina, gives the music hall scenes a rowdy authenticity. Jack the Ripper is skulking in the wings and Karl Marx lounges in the British Museum, but onstage — as in the movie theater — the killer’s depravity is simply entertainment.","Douglas Booth, Olivia Cooke, Sam Reid, María Valverde",N/A,UK,Juan Carlos Medina,"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","English, Irish",63,"In Victorian London, a Scotland Yard inspector hunts down the sadistic killer behind a series of gory, Jack the Ripper-Like murders.",NOT RATED,RLJ Entertainment,"[{'Value': '6.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",08 Sep 2017,109 min,The Limehouse Golem,"Jane Goldman (screenplay), Peter Ackroyd (based on the novel by)",2016,6.3,"12,443","[{'Value': '6.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '74%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '63/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the limehouse golem,,,,,,,,,

Exploring a similar idea with significantly less resonance, the writers of “Rememory,” Mark Palansky (who also directed) and Michael Vukadinovich, mash a fertile premise into sentimental mush.Sinking in the mire are some fine actors, including Anton Yelchin (in one of his last roles) and the great Peter Dinklage as Sam Bloom, the traumatized survivor of a car crash that killed his brother. Saved from suicide by Gordon Dunn (Martin Donovan), a psychologist who has invented a machine that recovers memories, Sam turns into an amateur sleuth when Dunn also winds up expired.A hodgepodge of pseudoscientific twaddle and variously shifty murder suspects, “Rememory” satisfies neither as science fiction nor as psychological drama. Pilfering Dunn’s machine from under the nose of his distracted widow (Julia Ormond, whose every scene is a banquet built from table scraps), Sam delves into the recorded memories of its test subjects. But in a movie that’s more about processing grief than finding a killer, his quest is no more than a soggy slog from one damaged soul to another.Yet Mr. Palansky, whose last movie was the peculiar “Penelope” in 2006, could have mined gold from the technology itself — as “Black Mirror” did by exploring the destructive desire to witness the memories of a lover. Instead, he uses the device mainly as an excuse to stuff the movie with fractured, random Kodak moments, interspersed with scenes of Mr. Dinklage gazing sorrowfully.

At their son’s wedding, she learns that Robin has accepted a job transfer from the East Coast to Wichita, Kan. He hasn’t bothered to consult Joan at all, assuming she will tag along.Later, in bed, Robin, played with brisk pretensions of authority by Michael Cristofer, shrugs off her concerns with something like contempt. At the end of their argument, Joan, played by Karen Allen with patience and precision, asks, “Why do you love me?” Mishearing, he says “Yes.” When she repeats the question, he responds, “Because you’re my wife. Men love their wives.” Twisting his knife, he finishes, “And their mothers.”Here, what seemed to Joan like a good marriage unveils itself as something wholly other. The movie deliberately descends from this brutal height to something friendlier, more encouraging and, alas, substantially more quaint.Based on a memoir by Joan Anderson, “Year by the Sea” depicts Joan taking up solo residence in Cape Cod, in search of self-realization. After meeting an array of droll locals, she encounters a woman (Celia Imrie), a dancer and the wife of the pioneering psychoanalyst Erik Erikson — who, among other things, coined the term “identity crisis.” .The writer-director Alexander Janko is also a composer, and he leavens the movie’s anecdotal structure with airs designed to enhance aperçus like “From adversity comes transcendence.” The movie is not entirely my cup of tea, although it is refreshing in its depiction of diverse, older female characters (including Joan’s quirky literary agent, played by S.

This film takes a step back to examine the author.","If you can’t make a movie out of “The Catcher in the Rye,” make one about the writing of it.Years after the book came out in 1951, Hollywood was still pursuing it. “Elia Kazan and Billy Wilder keep calling,” J. D. Salinger’s literary agent Dorothy Olding (Sarah Paulson) says in “Rebel in the Rye.”“Tell them no. And to stop calling,” he replies, briskly.Salinger’s disinclination stemmed from disappointment over the film “My Foolish Heart” (1949), based on his story “Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut.”Filmmakers are still eyeing “The Catcher in the Rye,” but Salinger’s estate is holding the line. Danny Strong, making his directorial feature debut, won some kind of lottery in getting the rights to a critical biography by Kenneth Slawenski. Mr. Strong seizes on the idea of Holden Caulfield as a Salinger alter ego and runs hard with it.While “Rebel in the Rye” isn’t quite as bad as its pile-of-bricks-clunky title suggests, it’s both simple- and literal-minded, less concerned with Salinger’s consciousness or sensibility than with his ostensible ontological status as a Tortured Creative Giant. Its depiction of Salinger’s probable PTSD, the product of his service in World War II, is almost insultingly hackneyed. When he discovers meditation through an Indian guru, the score, by Bear McCreary, comes alive with tablas and sitars. And so on.Nicholas Hoult plays Salinger with keen timing and palpable commitment, yet seems respectfully removed from the role. The only moments that set a spark pit him against Kevin Spacey as Whit Burnett, an early mentor. Their last scene together ends on a note that would, in a better movie, carry real emotional devastation.","Nicholas Hoult, Kevin Spacey, Victor Garber, Hope Davis","$354,363",USA,Danny Strong,"Biography, Drama, Romance",English,46,"The life of celebrated but reclusive author, J.D.

It is in these mundane moments that the director and writer Paul Shoulberg finds a story.Father Daniel (Zachary Spicer) is a young priest who looks like a model from a 1950s Catholic schoolbook — right down to his sweater vest collection and perfectly parted hair. He works under the elder Father Victor (Danny Glover), a by-the-book priest, and Father Ollie (John C. McGinley), a sports-obsessed Franciscan priest, in a Midwestern college town. During a confessional shift, Father Daniel listens to the problems of a coffee shop singer-songwriter, Jane (Wrenn Schmidt), and offers her friendship instead of a penance.“The Good Catholic” is almost as strait-laced as its protagonist. As Jane develops a crush on Daniel, the movie starts to follow a conventional path. Her character, given little screen time to match Daniel’s soul-searching, is most wanting. Some of Mr. Shoulberg’s directorial decisions — actors’ eyes drifting offscreen at an invisible audience — look theatrical rather than cinematic.Fortunately, Mr. Spicer’s earnest performance bolsters many of the weaker spots in Mr. Shoulberg’s script. The conflicting dynamics among the three men of the cloth provide most of the movie’s punch lines. Mr. Glover and Mr. McGinley each have their own scene-stealing one-liners to bounce off Mr. Spicer’s deadpan delivery. Here, friendship is its own form of saving grace.","Zachary Spicer, Wrenn Schmidt, Danny Glover, John C.

If you’ve watched any of Ms. Meyers’s movies, the resemblance between influence and imitation will be readily apparent. To wit: A star (Reese Witherspoon) plays a would-be charmer (here called Alice) whose neuroses are as fabulously customized as her kitchen. She’s what the brand-conscious call a creative, and while she works (a bit), she spends much of her time on man troubles. Her life is as fluffed as a throw pillow and so drained of realism it is best described as a lifestyle, which can make for a killer aspirational fantasy, at least in Nancy Meyers’s hands.“Home Again,” on the other hand, is wholly resistible, partly because it can’t fulfill the promise of that aspirational fantasy either on a craft level or in terms of its emotional and psychological portraiture. The problems begin with the script, or perhaps just with the insulting idea that Alice would be crying buckets into a mirror because she’s turning 40 on the day the story opens. Yes, she is newly separated from her music-industry husband (Michael Sheen), who likes to take calls from his New York office with its sweeping view. Alice doesn’t seem too bent out of shape by the separation. She’s busy building a new career as an interior decorator, and has moved with her two daughters into her childhood home, which she has redecorated to look like something out of a lower-budget Nancy Meyers movie.So why is Alice crying? Mostly to try to jump-start a movie that, formulaic step by step, needs to confirm that a single woman can be happy. You go, girl. That’s more or less it, with accent pieces and yoga lessons, though there are plot complications, some involving three friends, white dudes who had a hit at a film festival and now have a power agency behind them, several freelance gigs and, of course, the promise of great shining futures as Hollywood filmmakers. The three shack up in Alice’s guesthouse and soon they’re all one smiley family, which might be odd because they’re strangers and she has young daughters — except that this isn’t reality, it’s a bubble.Of course it is. Its three dudes, who sail from festival hype to Hollywood, evoke the fairy-tale trajectories of directors like Colin Trevorrow, who went from making a tiny movie to “Jurassic World.” Ms. Meyers-Shyer has taken a parallel path, one followed by members of the Coppola clan. Ms. Meyers helped produce “Home Again” and her former husband and filmmaking partner, Charles Shyer, served as their daughter’s second unit director. Alice’s dead father was a director, too. Canisters of film sit, no doubt decaying, in a sun-filled room, the same one in which his Oscar — the apotheosis of this movie’s aspirational thinking — stands as a shining testament to a daughter’s love and her picture’s absurdity.","Reese Witherspoon, Michael Sheen, Candice Bergen, Pico Alexander","$26,353,346",USA,Hallie Meyers-Shyer,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",English,41,Life for a single mom in Los Angeles takes an unexpected turn when she allows three young guys to move in with her.,PG-13,Open Road Films,"[{'Value': '5.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",08 Sep 2017,97 min,Home Again,Hallie Meyers-Shyer,2017,5.8,"18,622","[{'Value': '5.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '33%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '41/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",home again,Home Again,Open Road,2566.0,31.0,63.0,41.0,27020284.0,63.0,17479.0
170,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,It,Review: ‘It’ Brings Back Stephen King’s Killer Clown,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/movies/it-review-stephen-king.html,2017-09-08,2017-09-06,"This new, updated adaptation follows a bunch of kids on the trail of an evil force.","Late in the summer of 1989, the marquee of the downtown movie theater in Derry, Me., advertises “A Nightmare on Elm Street 5.” This is an accurate period detail, and also a declaration of kinship, if not outright homage. “It,” Andy Muschietti’s adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, belongs in the same tradition of small-town terror as Wes Craven’s “Nightmare” franchise, though the question of influence has a certain chicken-and-egg quality. Pennywise the clown, the designated predator in “It,” (played by Bill Skarsgard) is, like Freddy Krueger, an avatar of deep childhood fears. And like Freddy, he’s also the literal, lethal manifestation of the evil of the world. As such, he has the potential to spawn endless sequels. He’ll be back.Or rather, he is back. Mr. Muschietti’s “It,” written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, represents a second trip to this particular well. Mr. King’s novel, published in 1986, was adapted for network television in 1990. The new movie, a skillful blend of nostalgic sentiment and hair-raising effects, with the visual punch of big-screen digital hocus-pocus and the liberties of the R rating, still has the soothing charm of familiarity. The gang of misfit ’80s kids who face down the clown and the deeper horror he represents evoke both the middle school posse of the recent TV series “Stranger Things” (there’s some overlap in the cast), but also the intrepid brotherhood from “Stand by Me,” surely one of the all-time top five Stephen King movie adaptations.We can argue about the others — I’m happy to make a case for John Carpenter’s underrated “Christine” — but this “It” doesn’t quite ascend to their level. Nonetheless, the filmmakers honor both the pastoral and the infernal dimensions of Mr. King’s distinctive literary vision. Derry, with its redbrick storefronts and its quirks and kinks, seems like a genuinely nice place to live in spite of the fact that its citizens, children in particular, turn up missing or maimed at an alarming rate.The supernatural nastiness embodied by Pennywise is abetted and to some extent camouflaged by the ordinary human awfulness that also afflicts Derry. In addition to menacing clowns, phantasmatic lepers and spooky paintings come to life, the town is home to an ugly assortment of bullies (the worst one played by Nicholas Hamilton), gossips and abusive parents.Against these forces — the banal and the diabolical alike — “It” assembles a squad of early and preadolescent ghostbusters as varied as an infantry platoon in a World War II combat picture. The leader is Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), a melancholy, thoughtful boy whose little brother, Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), has been spirited down a storm sewer by Pennywise. Bill’s comrades — they call themselves the Losers’ Club — include a nerdy chatterbox (Finn Wolfhard) and a germ-phobic mama’s boy (Jack Dylan Grazer), plus a Jewish kid (Wyatt Oleff), a black kid (Chosen Jacobs) and a new kid (Jeremy Ray Taylor). Also a girl, Bev (Sophia Lillis), who becomes part of a sweet, alliterative romantic triangle involving Bill and the new kid, whose name is Ben.Like many real kids — even in 1989, even in Maine — they have filthy mouths. They also experience the freedom and peril of growing up in the days before cellphones, bicycle helmets and helicopter parenting. What’s scary about “It,” for them and for the audience, is also fun. The group ranges freely through the forests and fields around Derry, playing detective until the forces of darkness stand revealed with slimy tentacles and multiple rows of sharp, ravenous teeth.That isn’t a spoiler, but it’s a bit of paradox. The non-clown essence of It, an H.R. Gigeresque vagina dentata type of deal, is far less scary than Pennywise, with his fluting voice and red balloons, and the other specters that seem to spring from tender young psyches. As creature design has become easier and more elaborate, thanks to digital techniques, it has also become less imaginative. Movie monsters resemble one another more and more, and movies of distinct genres feel increasingly trapped within the expected. The climactic sequence of “It” sacrifices horror-movie creepiness for action-movie bombast, staging a big fight in a cavernous space. We might as well be looking at superheroes.That we aren’t comes as a relief. The young cast is consistently good company, in particular the Ben-Bill-Bev trio. Ms. Lillis earns the Molly Ringwald reference that mischievously pops up in the script as a wink to those in the audience who still remember the ’80s. What a great time that was to be afraid.","Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard","$326,898,358","USA, Canada",Andy Muschietti,"Drama, Horror, Thriller",English,69,"In the summer of 1989, a group of bullied kids band together to destroy a shapeshifting monster, which disguises itself as a clown and preys on the children of Derry, their small Maine town.",R,Warner Bros.

For decades, the residents of the tiny Tuscan town of Monticchiello have turned their lives into theater. Each year, they gather to discuss art and their world until they land on a topic that reflects their most recent, urgent concerns. Word by word, they push and pull, challenging one another as they shape a production. All the world’s a stage, but in Monticchiello that truism is movingly real, especially because these days its aging resident-players have more exits than entrances.Perched on a hilltop some two hours south of Florence, Monticchiello tends to be one of those towns that in English-language guidebooks rates a line or two in between chapters on Florence and Venice. One such book mentions the town’s “Teatro Povero (a folk theater production)”; another notes its “forbidding walls” and “medieval past,” assuring readers that it’s “well worth exploring” even if over all “there is nothing much in the way of sights.” These mercenary assessments are meant, of course, for harried, hurried travelers, including those of us lucky enough to shape a few precious days into something we call vacation.In their documentary “Spettacolo,” Jeff Malmberg and Chris Shellen stay a while. Their most obvious subject is the annual production that Monticchiello townspeople have mounted since the 1960s, when some could remember the Fascist occupation firsthand. In the early years, the residents put on pageants that, at least from the modest documentation in the movie, seem like elaborations on other regional events, like the centuries-old horse race called the Palio in nearby Siena. At some point, the Monticchiello residents turned to the more immediate past, revisiting, for instance, the trauma of the war and the day Nazis lined the villagers up, threatening to shoot them all.More recently, the economy has fueled the spettacolo, which the movie’s notes define as “performance, spectacle or play.” That was certainly the case in 2012, when the bulk of the movie was shot over a period of six months. In interviews, Mr. Malmberg has said that he and Ms. Shellen happened on Monticchiello while on a vacation. (Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen, who are married, share directing credit; he shot and edited the documentary, and she recorded sound.) They were ambling around, rather like the day trippers in the documentary, when they accidentally came across Andrea Cresti, an artist who turned out to be theater’s longtime director as well as the portal into this story.There’s very little about the making of the documentary itself in “Spettacolo,” which assumes the point of view of the unobtrusive, not-quite omniscient witness. The people tell their stories directly on camera, at times with deep emotion, their reminiscences augmented by faded photographs and archival moving images. The history of the theater emerges gradually as assorted personalities — former partisans, an ailing woman, an indifferent son — click into place. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Cresti, a charismatic figure with a gray beard and a leonine halo of hair, becomes the focal point as he struggles to turn the town’s latest collective concerns into its next big show.As the spettacolo takes shape with fractious dialogue and insistent politics, it becomes evident that the filmmakers are less interested in the final play than in its production, in its process and multiple meanings. Nothing if not discreet (and sly), Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen have shaped much of their material into four chapters that are named for the seasons. Each chapter is accompanied by ah-and-ooh beauty shots of the region, yet as winter gives way to spring and brown hills turn green, the day-to-day lives of the townspeople create a gentle, insistent critique of these seasonal postcards. Much like the town’s annual production, the movie is telling its own story dialectically.That story can be so poignant and is so intelligently told that it feels wrong, almost insulting, to call “Spettacolo” charming, even if the movie is often delightful. In guidebooks, charm tends to be a commercial marker, a signifier for an imaginary, easily salable and consumable notion of authenticity. Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen understand the allure of that imaginary world; they were, after all, on vacation when they discovered Monticchiello and their documentary is itself often lovely. Yet they remind you that people are not attractions and their homes are not museums, even if the global economy, its casual tourists and rich speculators are determined to prove otherwise.","Andrea Cresti, Chiara Del Ciondolo, Gianna Fiore, Gianpiero Giglioni",N/A,USA,"Jeff Malmberg, Chris Shellen",Documentary,Italian,N/A,"Once upon a time there was a tiny hill town in Tuscany that found a remarkable way to confront their issues - they turned their lives into a play.

The Vulture writer Kyle Buchanan has already provided a rundown of the substantial delays in the film’s release, which — for a project once regarded as an Oscar contender — might be taken as a sign of an odor other than floral. This week, Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, the film’s distributor, took the extraordinary step of defending the movie in advance with a column for Deadline Hollywood, though it is laced with passive-aggressive barbs like “I know this film’s not perfect, very few are, but it’s a perfectly good time in a movie theater.”Plenty of movies fit that description — and considering the hoopla, the most disappointing thing about “Tulip Fever,” directed by Justin Chadwick (“The Other Boleyn Girl”) and set in 17th-century Amsterdam, is that it’s neither a secret masterpiece nor a laughable disaster. True, there is the scene in which Jan (Dane DeHaan), the hunky portraitist having an affair with Sophia (Alicia Vikander), the unhappily married wife of a merchant, explains to her that the key to their escape is to bet big in the Dutch tulip market. “All we have to do is put all our eggs in one basket,” he says.Howlers like that are few and far between, though, in a script credited to Tom Stoppard and Deborah Moggach, adapting her own novel, that faithfully follows the template for overripe period dramas. The re-creation of Amsterdam in the Golden Age is credible, the sweeping camera moves look like a great workout, and the compositions suggest someone studied Vermeer. There is also a fascination with the milieu, in which speculators, owing to tulips’ value at the time, would bid on bulbs, prizing rare varieties and creating a soaring market that ultimately crashed. Even an abbess (Judi Dench) gets in on the action.Alas, the movie is not “The Wolf of Waalstraat” and more directly concerns a familiar love triangle. To ensure her siblings’ passage to New Amsterdam, the city that became New York, the orphaned Sophia has married Cornelis Sandvoort (Christoph Waltz), described as “the king of peppercorns.” Despite his ritualized lovemaking, she fails to conceive an heir. When her servant, Maria (Holliday Grainger, who also narrates) becomes pregnant by the fishmonger (Jack O’Connell), Sophia proposes a scheme in which Cornelis can keep the baby. In the meantime, Sophia must merely pretend to be pregnant while Maria pretends not to be. This unconvincing charade culminates in one of the silliest birth scenes in recent memory.The star turns — including one from Zach Galifianakis as the sort of drunk you do not want to entrust with your nest egg — stave off boredom, but the most disappointing thing about the end to the speculative bubble surrounding “Tulip Fever” is that there isn’t much there.","Alicia Vikander, Dane DeHaan, Jack O'Connell, Holliday Grainger","$2,399,374","UK, USA",Justin Chadwick,"Drama, History, Romance",English,38,An artist falls for a young married woman while he's commissioned to paint her portrait during the Tulip mania of 17th century Amsterdam.,R,The Weinstein Company,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Sep 2017,105 min,Tulip Fever,"Deborah Moggach (screenplay by), Tom Stoppard (screenplay by), Deborah Moggach (based upon the novel by)",2017,6.2,"12,582","[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '9%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '38/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",tulip fever,Tulip Fever,Weinstein Co.,23.0,-99.0,1.0,23.0,2425664.0,77.0,17486.0

Burning hormones for fuel, this hyperconfident first feature from the Brazilian director Anita Rocha da Silveira vividly pinpoints a time when everything is heightened. Feelings, colors and sounds sear and blaze, and death delivers the same frisson as sex.Especially for Bia (Valentina Herszage, 15 at the time of filming) and her three friends, whose upscale Rio de Janeiro neighborhood is suffering a rash of violent rapes and murders. Glistening apartment blocks gird a desolate construction site where the bodies are found and where Bia — in a scene that encapsulates the picture’s silly-chilly mood — gently kisses the bloodied lips of one near-dead girl. The killer might still be at large, but his identity is beside the point, his victims simply the aphrodisiac that ignites the movie’s atmosphere of sinister arousal.Clinging unswervingly to the girls’ viewpoints, “Kill Me Please” is at once brash and subtle, blissed out and razor sharp. Long, stalking shots of deserted roads and darkening landscapes alternate with the flares of garish color in a kaleidoscopic birthday party, and the rainbow fluorescence of a bus shelter at night. (The stunning cinematography is by João Atala.) And as Bia becomes increasingly obsessed with one of the victims, the director surrounds her with zombie-movie signifiers — like a herd of silent students, viewed from above, slowly exiting a school — that underscore the dazed sensuality of her actions.Sharing selfies and urban legends, the four friends are an unselfconscious sorority, flirting with the camera and making out with abandon.

The film carries a trace of the sweep of a great screen epic along with the straightforward, explanatory qualities of mass-audience TV, and is never less than absorbing.Smoothly interweaving the perspectives of British rulers at the viceroy’s house in Delhi and those of their Indian staff, it offers a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the motives of Lord Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville), Britain’s last viceroy to colonial India, who oversaw the transfer of power. That process is still hotly debated: The partition of India, which created an independent India and Pakistan, led to the displacement of more than 10 million people and mass carnage in the resulting violence.Gurinder Chadha, the British-raised director of “Bend It Like Beckham,” closes the film with an ode to her grandmother, who sought refuge from Pakistan in India. As its personal entry point, the film offers a love story between Jeet (Manish Dayal), a Hindu who works as one of Mountbatten’s servants, and Aalia (Huma Qureshi), a Muslim who is betrothed to someone else and may end up on the opposite side of a new border.Famous figures — including Mohandas K.

But “The Layover,” which probably scrapes by thanks to a line here or there, plays as if it were designed to thumb its nose at the concept.Directed by William H. Macy, for some reason, and written by David Hornsby and Lance Krall, the movie concerns two longtime Seattle friends who, when not in the presence of men, watch “The Bachelor.” Kate (Alexandra Daddario) is a teacher; Meg (Kate Upton) aspires to sell luxury cosmetics, though no one is buying her North Korean imports.To cure workplace blues, the pair hop a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and wind up seated next to Ryan (Matt Barr), their mutual masculine ideal. His half-interested presence compels them into destructive, flirty one-upmanship, especially after a hurricane diverts their plane to St. Louis (not the best-timed plot point) and they run into Ryan at their hotel.It’s a Sheraton, incidentally; if the chain didn’t pay for product placement, its logo and amenities got quite a bit of free play. Given the dimwitted clientele, however, the advertisement may not be such a steal. After Meg and Kate peacock for Ryan in a hot-air balloon and a diving competition, they hit the road, where the movie’s notion of fun comes to involve an unclean rest stop, slipped pills and an eminently foreseeable conclusion.","Kate Upton, Alexandra Daddario, Matt Barr, Matt Jones",N/A,USA,William H.

Until I Don’t,” Lake Bell’s pained sex comedy, is that there’s a lot of money in happy endings. And not the kind that are typically tacked onto movies like this one.Rather, the massage-parlor treat promised here is an anniversary gift from Cybil (Mary Steenburgen) to her longtime husband, Harvey (Paul Reiser). But the giving is itself an act of such passive-aggressive loathing that it all but destroys any comedic potential in their relationship, never mind any desire we might have to see their union endure.In that we’re joined by Vivian (Dolly Wells), a bitter British filmmaker who believes marriage to be unsustainable. To prove her thesis, she has enlisted Cybil and Harvey plus two more fractured Florida couples for what she is pleased to call a documentary. Ms. Bell (who also wrote the preposterous script) and Ed Helms play an unhappily childless twosome who practice “results-based” sex by means of a phone app that tracks ovarian cycles. And Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac are hippie-dippie caricatures whose free-love philosophy is as much a sham as Vivian’s filmmaking ethics.Painted in the broadest possible strokes, these ropy relationships agitate a movie that has neither a coherent point nor an authentic character. There’s little evidence here of the talent that made Ms. Bell’s 2013 filmmaking debut, “In a World ...” (about struggling voice-over artists), as gentle and genuine as this one is abrasive and cartoonish. Hanging out with these folks is no fun; being married to some of them is unimaginable.","Lake Bell, Ed Helms, Mary Steenburgen, Paul Reiser","$279,263",USA,Lake Bell,Comedy,English,43,An ensemble comedy about the meaning of matrimony.,R,The Film Arcade,"[{'Value': '4.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",01 Sep 2017,103 min,I Do...

Instead of Cold War chess moves in the mode of “Funeral in Berlin,” it serves up the ostensible threat of Islamist terror. Racine is an undercover C.I.A. agent posing as an employment counselor in London. She’s loath to do fieldwork because she feels responsible for not thwarting a terrorist strike in Paris years ago. But she’s pulled back in by the prospect of a horrifying biological attack. She needs to interrogate — “unlock” in spy-speak — a courier whose message could set the plan in motion, or stop it.And here the movie goes very old school, piling on spy thriller tropes: double crosses; chases; a stock taciturn white-haired would-be assassin (who, conveniently enough, can’t quite draw a bead on our heroine); an eager recruit who might as well be nicknamed Dead Meat; and dialogue like “I’m thinking I’m the only friend you’ve got.”I suppose this went down easily enough for me because I grew up with this kind of stuff, and can surrender to it as a kind of cinematic comfort food. But still. For those not so inclined, the entertainment value could conceivably be derived from the brisk, no-nonsense direction by Michael Apted, and the talents of what they used to call “an all-star cast” — in this case, Michael Douglas, Toni Collette, John Malkovich and Orlando Bloom.","Noomi Rapace, Orlando Bloom, Toni Collette, John Malkovich",N/A,"Czech Republic, Switzerland, UK, USA",Michael Apted,"Action, Drama, Mystery, Thriller","English, Arabic, German",46,A CIA interrogator is lured into a ruse that puts London at risk of a biological attack.,R,Lionsgate Premiere,"[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",05 May 2017,98 min,Unlocked,Peter O'Brien (screenplay),2017,6.2,"20,541","[{'Value': '6.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '25%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '46/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",unlocked,,,,,,,,,

Some are harmless idiots, and some are brutish ones. Eventually most of them grow out of it. Some of the brutish ones don’t, and if they happen to do something particularly heinous during their idiot period, their chance to reform may be cut short.One such group of fellows is depicted in “Jesús,” a Chilean film written and directed by Fernando Guzzoni. The antisocial demeanors and antics of these men eventually result in grave harm to an innocent.Jesús (Nicolás Durán) and his crew smoke dope, drink 40-ounces, watch drug-cartel execution videos on the internet, inveigle sex from girls they later insult behind their backs, and so on. And one night they brutally beat a young man in the park who is too drunk to walk, because they think he’s gay. This is followed almost immediately by a scene of Jesús having sex with one of his male friends, because, you know, of course. The beating makes national news, and Jesús turns to his father, from whom he has long been alienated.This movie has a lot of the stylistic and content hallmarks of what passes for committed realism in contemporary world cinema. A hand-held camera is often following the lead character from behind. There are explicit, seemingly unsimulated sex scenes. The filmmakers were inspired by a recent real-life event in Santiago. One feels the filmmaker trying hard to work out the inner struggles of his sad but largely unsympathetic characters.

These range from the menial (fixing her washing machine) to the potentially ruinous (smuggling a cake to Moscow by plane, which could cost a father who works at the airport his job). Ms. Maurery has great fun with the character, a tricky part because Maria nearly always maintains a kindhearted veneer, even at her most venal. It’s clear she has no regard for her class’s well-being or education.While somewhat on the nose as allegory, the movie deftly illustrates that a culture of collaboration — whether in Bratislava in the 1980s or, indeed, any political or workplace context — requires active participation, even if subconscious. When Maria backs down on the cake-smuggling request, Marek (Csongor Kassai), the airport accountant, is so relieved that he offers to drive her to her country cottage, seemingly oblivious that he’s being pressed into a different kind of service.Most of what we see of Maria comes in flashbacks during a parents’ conference the school’s head teacher (Ina Gogalova) has convened, risking her own job because Maria is the chair of the Communist Party at the school. But if enough parents sign a formal complaint, they may be able to oust her.There are shades of “12 Angry Men” in the scenes of the parents trying to convince one another to sign it. Contrary to the idea that strength comes in numbers, “The Teacher” illustrates that some of the parents, while individually upset, are afraid to speak up as a group. They’ve already bought into a corrupt system, acceding to the teacher’s demands, and signing the petition is tantamount to an admission of guilt.Like Mr. Hrebejk’s “Divided We Fall” — a story of a sheepish Czech gentile who locates a vein of courage and generosity during the Nazi occupation — “The Teacher” is polished, engaging and somewhat risk-averse. True, there’s nothing lighthearted about the plot, which finds one student driven toward suicide and an astrophysicist father (Peter Bebjak), whose wife has left him, reduced to washing windows.But “The Teacher” doesn’t dare take its premise to darker places by having Maria prod the parents too far beyond the bounds of their own moral compasses — a logical conclusion of this story. As the psychologist Stanley Milgram’s experiments on obedience showed — and some governments have learned — a flock in thrall to an authority figure may follow that person anywhere.","Zuzana Mauréry, Zuzana Konecná, Csongor Kassai, Tamara Fischer",N/A,"Slovakia, Czech Republic",Jan Hrebejk,"Comedy, Drama",Slovak,77,"Since the arrival of the new teacher, Maria Drazdechova, to a Bratislava suburban school in the year of 1983, life has turned upside down for students and parents.

The screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson and the director George Nolfi only intermittently manage to breathe credible cinematic life into that milieu in “Birth of the Dragon,” which is set in late ’60s San Francisco, where, the movie tells us, Lee taught kung fu. (It was actually Oakland.)The movie’s linchpin is a real-life battle between Lee (Philip Ng) and a Shaolin monk, Wong Jack Man (Yu Xia), which an opening title says was reputed to have been spurred by Wong’s objection to Lee’s “kung fu for all” ethos. In the movie’s view, Lee’s real problem is his bluff arrogance. Wong’s approach is more spiritual, less egocentric. This attracts one of Lee’s white students, the overly aggressive Steve (Billy Magnussen), who happens to be in love with a young Asian immigrant who’s being groomed for a concubine’s life by a female boss. Steve can’t fight for her, but the boss is interested in staging an event that can generate some gambling profits. You see where this is going. For the sake of their pal, Wong and Lee agree to test each other in battle. It’s clear that Wong is right about Lee’s egotism being a limitation, but the question is whether Lee will get it.The “West Side Story” romance angle is the least interesting part of the movie, so it’s frustrating that so much time is spent on it. “Birth of the Dragon” is ambitious: It wants to be a character study, an explication of martial arts philosophy and an action picture. (The battle scenes are presented in a mix of slow motion with super-clear fast-shutter shots and they’re not always enhanced by this approach.) But the film never really gets fully juiced until the climax, when rivalries are put aside and the two very charismatic leads get on the same side to kick some righteous butt.","Yu Xia, Wang Xi'An, Hai Yu, Yue Wu","$6,895,695","China, Canada, USA",George Nolfi,"Action, Biography, Drama","English, Mandarin",35,"Set against the backdrop of 1960s San Francisco, BIRTH OF THE DRAGON is a modern take on the classic movies that Bruce Lee was known for.

(Like Ms. Hittman’s first feature, “It Felt Like Love,” “Beach Rats” doubles as a portrait of Brooklyn’s southern-shore neighborhoods, lyrically photographed by Hélène Louvart.)During a fireworks show, Frankie effortlessly — in the sense of exerting no effort — catches the eye of Simone (Madeline Weinstein), who flirts with him oblivious to his uncertain sexuality. After initially taking her home only to rebuff her, he spends much of the movie waffling on the relationship, trying to make it work and even defensively confessing to a man he accompanies to a motel for sex that he has a girlfriend.Frankie’s drug intake, his ailing father, his relationships with his mother (Kate Hodge) and younger sister (Nicole Flyus) and perhaps even his reluctance to leave familiar surroundings all contribute to a powerful sense of limbo. The back-and-forths of the character’s decisions feel real, and Mr. Dickinson’s laconic blankness (you would never guess the actor was British) helps to give Frankie’s existential crisis a charge. Ms. Hittman is also assured enough to know it can’t be easily resolved.","Harris Dickinson, Madeline Weinstein, Kate Hodge, Neal Huff","$457,847",USA,Eliza Hittman,Drama,English,78,A Brooklyn teenager spends his days experimenting with drugs and looking online for older men to meet with.,R,NEON,"[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",25 Jan 2018,98 min,Beach Rats,Eliza Hittman,2017,6.4,"7,529","[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '86%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '78/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",beach rats,Beach Rats,Neon,610.0,-20.0,8.0,76.0,471286.0,56.0,17458.0

With arms outstretched from the sides of the screen, and our eyes taking in the perspective of the killer, we shoot, hack and beat our way through a sea of assailants.As directed by Jung Byung-gil, a former stuntman, the film mirrors the experience of playing a video game. The camera whips to each new target with the assurance of someone who knows all the combinations, and has instinctive, practiced access to every code and cheat. The only sign of conscious, unautomated humanity is the sound of the protagonist’s ragged breathing — an acknowledgment of the exhaustion that comes when a human being is pushed to become an action avatar.Such is the plight of Sook-hee (Kim Ok-bin), a trained assassin who is the focus of this convoluted thriller. After executing the movie’s opening slaughter, she is caught by the police and recruited as a sleeper agent by an intelligence agency, which promises her freedom following 10 years of service. As “The Villainess” jumps between Sook-hee’s past and present, it becomes clear that she is trapped in a dizzying world of violence, where neither law nor outlaws can be trusted. Yet despite her despair, every action scene is as queasily pristine as the first, leaving “The Villainess” caught in paradox. It’s hard to enjoy the action when you witness its emotional cost, but once Sook-hee starts slashing goons from atop motorcycles, it’s equally impossible to root for the violence to stop.","Ok-bin Kim, Ha-kyun Shin, Jun Sung, Seo-hyeong Kim","$27,442",South Korea,Byung-gil Jung,"Action, Drama",Korean,64,A female assassin leaves a trail of bodies behind her as she seeks revenge.,NOT RATED,Next Entertainment World,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",08 Jun 2017,129 min,The Villainess,"Byeong-sik Jung, Byung-gil Jung",2017,6.7,"7,748","[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '83%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '64/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the villainess,,,,,,,,,

The lyric could also serve as an alternate title for “England Is Mine,” Mark Gill’s unauthorized and unrelentingly dour biopic of the early years of the group’s frontman, Steven Patrick Morrissey.Unfolding mainly in dingy rooms, whose cheap curtains barely obscure the miserable Manchester streets beyond, this doggedly unilluminating portrait opens in 1976 with the 17-year-old Morrissey (a game Jack Lowden) immersed in Oscar Wilde and the New York Dolls. Fulminating with contempt for England and disdain for the daily grind, he bangs out vitriolic screeds on an old typewriter, the confrontational prose at odds with his diffident manner. There is also a great deal of moping.With its bleak, yearning tone and defiantly cloudy color palette, “England Is Mine” has a pleasingly granular feel for its era and location. But its imagining of Morrissey as a self-pitying narcissist, a curiously passive intellectual who can’t get out of his own way, soaks the movie in a wearying inertia. While we’re all waiting for greatness to find him, though, three hardy women are around to nudge things along: A punkish artist (Jessica Brown Findlay), a hectoring best mate (Katherine Pearce) and his empathetic Mum (Simone Kirby), whose support for her sulky son never wavers.Skirting sexuality and absent Morrissey’s music (the movie ends in 1982 as he and Johnny Marr are on the brink of forming the band), “England Is Mine” is a soggy schlep.

This dystopian glimpse of a Brooklyn neighborhood features an army of snipers and storm troopers.,"“Bushwick” opens with a beautiful aerial shot of New York — moving north over Brooklyn from Coney Island — that turns out to be the view from a helicopter gunship. The city is under attack, invaded not by a foreign or extraterrestrial army but by forces of secession from the southern United States. A young woman named Lucy (Brittany Snow), on her way to visit her grandmother, finds herself caught up in a new civil war.This is not a bad premise. The idea that regional and ideological divisions might erupt into violent conflict doesn’t seem entirely far-fetched these days, and low-budget genre movies can often generate more political insight than their prestige-minded Hollywood cousins. But while “Bushwick,” directed by Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott from a script by Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, offers reasonable technical competence — following shots that are as fluid and kinetic as expert video-game play — its storytelling is dimwitted and amateurish.Fleeing black-uniformed snipers and storm troopers, as well as opportunistic street criminals, Lucy teams up with a burly janitor named Stupe (Dave Bautista), and they zigzag through the neighborhood that gives the movie its title. The name once signified a working-class black and Latino part of New York, but lately it has become synonymous with the artisanal, post-collegiate culture of 21st-century Brooklyn.The filmmakers feign boldness in tackling national politics, but revert to coyness and caricature when it comes to local matters, gesturing toward a multiculturalism that isn’t even skin deep and sweeping gentrification under the rug. The civil war “Bushwick” imagines is mostly about white people, which kind of makes the movie a piece of historical revisionism about something that hasn’t even happened yet.","Dave Bautista, Brittany Snow, Angelic Zambrana, Jeremie Harris",N/A,USA,"Jonathan Milott, Cary Murnion","Action, Adventure",English,44,"When a Texas military force invades their Brooklyn neighborhood, 20-year-old Lucy and war veteran Stupe must depend on each other to survive.",TV-MA,RLJ Entertainment,"[{'Value': '5.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",25 Aug 2017,94 min,Bushwick,"Cary Murnion (story by), Jonathan Milott (story by), Nick Damici (screenplay by), Graham Reznick (screenplay by)",2017,5.2,"6,515","[{'Value': '5.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '43%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '44/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",bushwick,,,,,,,,,

So tackling “Death Note,” the sprawling, gobsmackingly detailed Japanese manga series by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, is a ballsy move — even if you’re backed by Netflix. And for the director Adam Wingard, who needs a win after last year’s disappointing “Blair Witch” sequel, the prospect of riling those fans must have been especially daunting.Devotees of Mr. Wingard, on the other hand, will immediately recognize a sensibility — rare among horror-movie directors — that prioritizes mood over mayhem. From the dreamy opening to the flashback-heavy finale, the movie has a tone and temperament that are consistently his own. The sharply executed violence, jabs of humor and, in particular, a fascination with the seductiveness of evil (most pronounced in his 2014 feature, “The Guest”) are all here, albeit in a compressed package.Set in Seattle (played by Vancouver, British Columbia), the story centers on Light (Nat Wolff), a smart, isolated high schooler whose world is upended when an ancient, leather-bound notebook drops from the heavens. Inside are instructions: Picture the face and write the name of whomever you would like to kill, and that soul’s expiration is assured. A test run to eliminate a troublesome bully is spectacularly successful, and soon Light and his girlfriend, Mia (an underserved Margaret Qualley), are wiping out evildoers worldwide.Lurking in Light’s bedroom, however, is the actual killer: A mischievous Japanese death spirit named Ryuk (voiced with cackling relish by Willem Dafoe), who resembles a rotting tree trunk and behaves like an annoying goad. Yet this malevolent house pest is far less worrisome than L, a ninja-styled über-detective who is obsessively investigating the murders. As played by a mesmerizing Lakeith Stanfield, L is a twitchy oddity with an attentive handler (Paul Nakauchi) and a back story that deserves its own spinoff. Face half hidden beneath a black turtleneck, L crouches on chairs like an anime arachnid, sucking up candies and sniffing out clues.By far the more entertaining of the two mythically entwined antagonists, L zeros in on Light with eccentric speed. And that’s the problem: Perhaps stifled by the cultural and commercial clout of its source material (a multimedia juggernaut of books, movies, television shows and a stage musical), “Death Note” feels rushed and constricted. As a result, what should have been Light’s incremental surrender to godlike power becomes an instantaneous embrace, and what ought to have played out as an extended manhunt is resolved with embarrassing ease.Cramming several tons of plot into a one-pound screenplay, the three writers (one of whom, Jeremy Slater, created Fox television’s thoughtful adaptation of “The Exorcist”) have little option but to condense. That said, Mr. Wingard’s eye for a stylish image hasn’t dimmed. Working with the cinematographer David Tattersall, he concocts sequences that tilt and drift, awash in neon and a soundtrack that evokes a woozy, winking romanticism. At certain moments, we can almost feel his desire to shrug off the straitjacket of fidelity and make this tale of false gods and flawed superheroes completely his own.","Mamoru Miyano, Brad Swaile, Vincent Tong, Ryô Naitô",,Japan,N/A,"Animation, Crime, Drama",Japanese,N/A,An intelligent high school student goes on a secret crusade to eliminate criminals from the world after discovering a notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written into it.,TV-14,,"[{'Value': '9.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",21 Oct 2007,24 min,Death Note,N/A,2006–2007,9,"165,078","[{'Value': '9.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",death note,,,,,,,,,

Janicza Bravo’s feature debut, written with her husband and its star, Brett Gelman, traffics in the same anti-humor as Rick Alverson’s “The Comedy” and “Entertainment,” knowingly titled movies that offer nothing of the sort. Give “Lemon” credit, then: It’s a case of truth in advertising.The movie opens with a woman on television recounting horrors in Africa, it seems, only to pivot to the viewer on the couch, something of a tragic case himself. Isaac (Mr. Gelman) is a failure in every respect: career, grooming and — we eventually discover — pet-sitting and bathroom hygiene. He appears in embarrassing ads. While working as an acting teacher, he pits two students (Gillian Jacobs and Michael Cera, sporting what looks like a rodent-chewed Art Garfunkel hairdo) against each other, perhaps for his amusement. Though he’s not laughing. After Mr. Cera’s character finds success, Isaac tags his car with a slur.Isaac is also in a floundering relationship with a blind woman (Judy Greer), who respects him almost as little as he does her. In a centerpiece of sorts, Isaac attends a Passover Seder at which his brother (Martin Starr) questions the Jewishness of their sister (Shiri Appleby) and her black son (Blake Anthony Crawford). You could cry anti-Semitism, but you’d be taking the bait; the movie calculates its ethnic stereotypes to offend and dares you not to be in on the gag.The protagonist eventually tiptoes toward functionality while wooing a woman (Nia Long) who, like Ms. Bravo, is black. At this point “Lemon” apparently becomes an inside joke about the filmmakers. (Mr. Gelman is Jewish.) The rampant self-loathing was just a ruse for narcissism.","Brett Gelman, Judy Greer, Michael Cera, Gillian Jacobs",N/A,USA,Janicza Bravo,"Comedy, Drama",English,59,A man watches his life unravel after he is left by his girlfriend of 10 years.,NOT RATED,N/A,"[{'Value': '4.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",18 Aug 2017,83 min,Lemon,"Janicza Bravo, Brett Gelman",2017,4.6,"1,198","[{'Value': '4.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '59/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",lemon,,,,,,,,,

As for the adults who’ll get dragged to the theater: You’ve seen it all before, though it’s pleasant enough to watch again.Beginning at a French orphanage sometime around the 1880s, this good-natured tale finds 11-year-old Félicie (voiced by Elle Fanning) and her friend Victor (Nat Wolff) ready to run away to Paris, where she hopes to become a ballerina and he an inventor. After this generic pair is chased by the orphanage overseer (Mel Brooks, criminally underused) they arrive in the big city.Félicie is the focus here, and soon she’s befriending Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen), a former dancer turned cleaning woman, and trying out for a prestigious ballet school as various villains conspire to quash her hopes. Along the way she is told to follow her dreams, to never give up and to take big risks.Those messages are delivered often, and emphasized, to inspire young viewers. Fair enough. Less justifiable is the hit-or-miss humor and a well-worn plotline. Panoramic images of Paris, dance sequences and montages of Félicie in training add some energy.Directed by Éric Summer and Éric Warin (and first released in Europe as “Ballerina,” sans that wanton exclamation point), “Leap!” remains peppy as it sets its bar at a low-to-medium height then cheerfully clears it. Sure, the movie could have heeded its own advice and taken a few risks.

A jury convicted two young men of the murder, one of whom, Colin Warner, had nothing to do with it. Nonetheless, Mr. Warner spent more than 20 years in prison until, thanks in large part to the tireless efforts of his friend Carl King (known as CK), his conviction was overturned and he was released.This story inspired a gripping, enraging episode of “This American Life,” and “Crown Heights,” written and directed by Matt Ruskin, tries to adhere both to the factual record and a careful, detail-focused documentary ethos. Like its protagonist, sensitively and shrewdly played by Lakeith Stanfield, the film is soft-spoken and thoughtful, with sweet, lyrical touches that alleviate some of the grimness without blunting the cruelty and injustice of what happened.On the day of the murder, as Colin and CK (Nnamdi Asomugha) go about their routines, “Crown Heights” quietly registers the texture of New York life in 1980. The crime and violence that were much more prevalent then than now, but also the daily rituals of love, family and work that never really change. Colin steals a car (for the chop shop where he works), flirts with a neighbor, Antoinette (Natalie Paul), and runs an errand for his grandmother. Then all of a sudden he’s in custody, and ensnared in a bureaucratic and penal nightmare. Months stretch into years, and while CK raises money, hires lawyers and pursues appeals, Colin, incarcerated at the New York state penitentiary in Dannemora, fights to stay sane, safe and hopeful.Our attention shifts back and forth between the two men, which provides narrative momentum at the cost of dramatic and psychological depth. CK’s devotion to the cause of his friend’s exoneration strains his marriage, and the long sequence of stalls and setbacks in court and in parole hearings erodes Colin’s morale. These developments are conveyed in scenes that feel a bit too pointed and familiar — effective in the moment but not quite as powerful as they might have been.But “Crown Heights” nonetheless makes a powerful argument that Colin’s imprisonment was hardly an anomaly. Mr. Ruskin cuts in news clips of several generations of politicians from both parties — including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and former New York Gov. George E. Pataki — making tough-on-crime speeches promising longer sentences, more executions and less parole. In the meantime, the kinds of policies they promote take their toll on Colin.Like countless other black men, he is ensnared in a system that seems rigged against him in every way. The police, the prosecutors, the prison guards and some of his own lawyers cut corners, rush to judgment and ignore the clear evidence of his innocence. You get the sense that they are part of a vast, shadowy, brutal machine, the illumination of which feels urgently necessary even as it lies outside the film’s scope.But the choice to focus on Colin rather than on his persecutors is an honorable and ethical one, and “Crown Heights” is a moving tribute to his resilience and the steadfastness of the people who love him.","Luke Forbes, Lakeith Stanfield, Adriane Lenox, Nnamdi Asomugha","$236,439",USA,Matt Ruskin,"Biography, Crime, Drama, Romance",English,64,"When Colin Warner is wrongfully convicted of murder, his best friend Carl King devotes his life to proving Colin's innocence.",R,Amazon Studios and IFC Films,"[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",18 Aug 2017,94 min,Crown Heights,Matt Ruskin,2017,6.4,"1,288","[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '76%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '64/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",crown heights,,,,,,,,,

(The unrelated Iran hostage crisis was unfolding in Tehran at the time.)From a structural standpoint, what is interesting about this dramatization of events is that it only occasionally strays from the vantage points of those on the outside. That puts the viewer in the shoes of the government officials and other onlookers as they weigh various options — loading the hostage-takers onto a bus to Heathrow Airport and raiding the bus, entering the embassy through a skylight — for ending the situation.The factions are accorded one major actor apiece: Mark Strong is an inspector with a police negotiations team, Abbie Cornish is a BBC News reporter, Jamie Bell is a member of Britain’s Special Air Service and Tim Pigott-Smith (who died in April) is William Whitelaw, Britain’s home secretary. Over the phone, Mr. Strong’s character builds trust with the gunmen’s leader (Ben Turner). The last thread most compels the director, Toa Fraser, to violate the strictures on perspective.With a barrage of title-card identifications, “6 Days” can feel closer to a re-enactment than a thriller. To the extent that the movie has a political angle, it’s perhaps gratuitously jingoistic. A closing note that the captors “lie in unmarked graves in East London” seems out of step with what precedes it.","Jamie Bell, Mark Strong, Abbie Cornish, Martin Shaw",N/A,"UK, New Zealand",Toa Fraser,"Action, Drama, History, Thriller",English,36,"In April 1980, armed gunmen stormed the Iranian Embassy in Princes Gate, London and took all inside hostage.

And if “Sidemen: Long Road to Glory” is to be believed, most of those highways converge on three bluesmen in particular: the drummer Willie Smith, the guitarist Hubert Sumlin and the pianist Joe Willie Perkins, known as Pinetop.Germinating and shape-shifting for almost a decade, Scott Rosenbaum’s loving tribute (originally conceived in 2008 as a “Last Waltz”-style concert film) pulls back the big-name curtain to celebrate these often overlooked backing musicians whose riffs and runs are revered to this day. As proof, a slew of sunken-eyed rock legends — including Johnny Winter, Gregg Allman, Keith Richards and Joe Perry — is on hand to share memories of the men and attest to their lasting influence.But “Sidemen” is about more than just legacy. Blessed with extensive interviews with their buoyant subjects (all three of whom died in 2011 within months of one another), Mr. Rosenbaum and his producer Jasin Cadic shape a narrative of professional insecurity and personal resilience. From playing brothels and juke joints in the Jim Crow South to decades-long collaborations with the Chicago blues pioneers Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, the three weathered careers of astonishing flux.Their stories are inseparable from that of the blues itself, which the filmmakers illustrate with a wealth of clips and concert footage reaching back more than half a century.

It’s a universal religion, bringing the promise of grace and salvation into an otherwise drab existence. With a head full of bling-spangled reveries and a notebook full of rhymes, Patti (to use her most common nickname) hones her skills and indulges her dreams with her friend Hareesh (Siddharth Dhananjay), a pharmacist whose nom de mike is Jheri.“Patti Cake$,” Geremy Jasper’s big-hearted and astute debut film — he wrote, directed and composed the songs that make Patti and Jheri’s aspirations plausible — could have gone wrong in a dozen different ways. The story of a white suburban redhead chasing hip-hop glory may set off alarms about cultural appropriation, but the film mostly disarms them, or mixes them into the soundtrack. “Why don’t you act your age?” Patti asks her mother, Barb (Bridget Everett), an almost-was wannabe stuck in her own rock ’n’ roll fantasies. “Why don’t you act your race?” is Barb’s barbed retort.Mother and daughter could easily have been figures of mockery. It’s silly of Patti to imagine that she could be the next Nicki Minaj, and pathetic that Barb belts out old radio hits at karaoke. A lot of people in the movie make fun of the Dombrowski women, Patti in particular. Since middle school, she’s been known as Dumbo, and when she enters into an impromptu rap battle with a guy who works at the local pizza place, his rhymes are full of fat-shaming and sexual humiliation. She gives back as good as she gets, and the film, rather than join in the ridicule, registers its cruelty.But we’re not invited to feel sorry for her either. In structure and attitude, “Patti Cake$” adheres to a template familiar to readers of young adult fiction, blending realism with gentle but unmistakable messages of encouragement. It tells the story of a band of young misfits asserting themselves in a world that refuses to see their value. Jheri and Patti find a beat wizard (and Patti finds a romantic interest) in the person of a taciturn African-American punk rocker (Mamoudou Athie) who lives in a shack near the cemetery and goes by the name of Basterd. The three of them, now called PBNJ, start cutting tracks and planning their assault on the big time. It’s impossible not to root for them.The older generation comes in for harsher treatment. Wayward parents are a staple of the genre, and Barb wouldn’t place high in a mother-of-the-year contest, but Ms. Everett, a popular cabaret performer and a brilliant actress, endows her with dignity even at her worst. Patti’s grandmother (Cathy Moriarty) gives her more support and earns more sympathy, and also serves as a kind of guarantor of her granddaughter’s decency and ultimate safety. There will be tears, embarrassment and disappointment, but we’re not here to be miserable.And Ms. Macdonald is quite simply a revelation, capturing the reflexive self-confidence and defensive diffidence of the millennial generation with sneaky sincerity and offhand wit. Though it is expressively shot and crisply edited, the credibility of “Patti Cake$” ultimately rests on her shoulders. We have to believe that Patti is talented, and also that the odds are not in her favor. “It’s a cold world out there,” she’s told by her favorite D.J. (played by MC Lyte), and for us to savor the sweetness of Patti’s creativity we need to feel that chill.Mr. Jasper at once finds a new variation on a central hip-hop theme and gives a hip-hop inflection to a durable show-business-movie convention. As long as there are underdogs and misunderstood kids fighting to be noticed (and paid), there will be stories like this one, walking the line between cliché and classic with grit, conviction and just enough cynicism to keep things from getting too corny.","Sahr Ngaujah, Danielle Macdonald, Bridget Everett, Mamoudou Athie","$794,817",USA,Geremy Jasper,"Drama, Music",English,67,"PATTI CAKE$ is centered on aspiring rapper Patricia Dombrowski, a.k.a.

It’s really about how we create art.Sinking into a dedicated — and overwhelmingly male — subculture of enthusiasts, the director Doug Nichol unearths a trove of reasons for loving the clicketyclacking machine. The playwright and actor Sam Shepard (who died last month) confesses an addiction to the percussive sound of thoughts striking paper. Tom Hanks, an avid collector who owns around 250 machines and types almost daily, declares that he hates emailed thank-you notes and simply deletes them. Take note, sycophants and star-stalkers.More substantively, the musician John Mayer and the historian David McCullough speak eloquently of the need for tangible proof of creation versus the ephemeral nature of digital data. Denied diaries, letters or first drafts — whether of songs or presidential speeches — future historians will find it much harder to plumb the minds of the famous.Overlong and poorly annotated (interviewees are not identified until the end, and even then without photographs), “California Typewriter” fields plenty of thinkers, but it’s the fringe folks who entertain. Like the sculptor Jeremy Mayer, who — inspired by multiple viewings of “Metropolis” — transforms irreparable machines into fantastic beasts and life-size figures. Or the self-described typewriter poet, Silvi Alcivar, who composes impromptu stanzas for any occasion and for people who just need cheering up.As an alternative, those clients could slip into a performance by the delightful members of the Boston Typewriter Orchestra.

194,A.O. SCOTT,1,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Logan Lucky,Review: ‘Logan Lucky’: Steven Soderbergh and His Motley Band of Thieves,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/movies/review-logan-lucky-steven-soderbergh-and-his-motley-band-of-thieves.html,2017-08-18,2017-08-16,"This class-conscious caper, with Channing Tatum and Adam Driver as down-on-their-luck brothers, is ridiculously entertaining.","In American movies — and maybe not only there — the idea of luck often functions as a euphemism for, and an antidote to, the effects of class. In a land of winners and losers, where life is acknowledged to be unfair and positive thinking is all-powerful, we often find fault (or solace) not in our social structures but in our stars.“Logan Lucky,” Steven Soderbergh’s gravity-defying, ridiculously entertaining new film — one that ends a blessedly brief retirement from big-screen directing — concerns itself with a desperate attempt to even the odds. It’s a caper movie, a modern-day Robin Hood tale organized around an elaborate, improbable but curiously plausible heist. A gang that includes a wounded veteran, an unemployed former coal miner, a hairdresser and other motley members of the noncoastal nonelite conspires to knock over a Nascar race sponsored by Coca-Cola. The event sucks a lot of cash from people like them, and the thieves quite literally set out to suck it right back up.That description might make the movie sound more pointed than it is. But Mr. Soderbergh’s class consciousness — something that has popped up often in his career, in “Erin Brockovich” and “The Girlfriend Experience,” in “Bubble” and, of course, in “Magic Mike” — is atmospheric rather than programmatic. Nobody in “Logan Lucky” utters a political word, but the setting carries a heavy, obvious charge of political significance all the same. The Logans in question are proud, hard-pressed residents of West Virginia, a state that, in the real world, punches far above its demographic weight in partisan and symbolic importance. Their land is beautiful and their water is contaminated. The film’s anthem is John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a hillbilly elegy if ever there was one.Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), who plays the song for his young daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), while they work on his pickup truck, knows that its authenticity is questionable. Two of the credited writers, he says, had probably never even been to West Virginia when they hymned the beauty of its valleys and rivers. (“Logan Lucky,” it should probably be pointed out, was shot mostly in Georgia.) But Jimmy also knows that even pop-culture artifice can carry a spore of genuine sentiment, and Mr. Soderbergh shows a similar faith in the impure products of America. A student of movie traditions high and low, he draws his inspiration here less from the gritty, downbeat realism of ’70s New Hollywood than from that decade’s good-time populist genre hybrids. If the “Oceans” series represented his updating of Kennedy-era Rat Pack swagger, “Logan Lucky” revives the irreverent, hell-raising outlaw vibe of “Smokey and the Bandit.”Not that this movie feels in any way like a throwback. Mr. Tatum is about 10 times sexier than Burt Reynolds ever was, and about one-tenth as vain. Since his early screen appearances (in “Step Up” and “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints”), it’s been evident that he is a singularly charismatic performer, but by now it should be clear that he’s also a great actor. I think his appeal has less to do with any supposed Everyman quality (though every man can dream, of course) than with an uncanny ability to convey irony and sincerity in the same gesture, to balance his effortless magnetism with unforced modesty.Jimmy, once a high school football star, has not quite resigned himself to life on the short end of the stick. Laid off from a construction job in North Carolina, he returns home to discover that his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) and her car-dealer husband (David Denman) are planning to move out of West Virginia with Sadie. Jimmy’s brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost a hand in Iraq, thinks the family is cursed. Jimmy doesn’t share this superstition, and in any case he has a plan, or at least a how-to list for bank robbers that he decides to adapt for new circumstances.Like George Clooney’s Danny Ocean, he needs, first of all, to put together a crew. Starting with Clyde and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), Jimmy taps into another kinship network, recruiting an explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson). That’s not quite everyone, but there are some dandy little surprises in store that I’m not inclined to spoil.Not that the plot is anything earth-shakingly original. “Logan Lucky” sticks to the “Oceans” template so faithfully that someone makes a joke about it. Who cares? The pleasures of the heist genre are always procedural and specific. These movies are all the same, but also always different because of the particular mix of personalities and circumstances. What they celebrate, above all, is the combination of craft, planning and problem-solving ingenuity that can turn a job of work into a work of art. They are, in other words, the quintessential movie movies, reflecting the collaborative challenges and logistical triumphs of the production cycle.For that reason, a good heist movie can settle into a sweet spot where reality and fantasy converge. This one’s narrative engine hums along nicely, occasionally accelerating into farce, usually when Mr. Craig shows up, sporting neck tattoos, spiky bleached hair and an accent that sounds like the cause or the result of a badly sprained tongue. (The dialects are all over the map, but let’s not get too hung up on authenticity.)Mr. Soderbergh never speeds through the twists and bumps. He downshifts and pulls onto the shoulder, letting the story take care of itself while the audience enjoys the sometimes funny, sometimes fractious, sometimes wistful pleasure of the characters’ company. By the time you encounter Hilary Swank’s F.B.I. agent, or figure out that the obnoxious British energy-drink mogul who is the only truly villainous character is Seth MacFarlane, you feel like you’re a family-reunion crasher who stuck around long enough to get promoted to second cousin.Of the three movies released this summer that self-consciously reactivate an old-school outlaw mythology — the others are Edgar Wright’s “Baby Driver” and Josh and Benny Safdie’s “Good Time” — this one has the most to say and the least to prove. Whereas the other directors aggressively promote their own coolness, flaunting borrowed attitudes and showy retrofitted styles, Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness, and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. “Logan Lucky” is a terrific movie. That’s a matter of skill, and maybe also of luck. But mostly it’s a matter of generosity.","Farrah Mackenzie, Channing Tatum, Jim O'Heir, Riley Keough","$27,696,504",USA,Steven Soderbergh,"Comedy, Crime, Drama",English,78,Two brothers attempt to pull off a heist during a NASCAR race in North Carolina.,PG-13,Fingerprint Releasing / Bleecker Street,"[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",18 Aug 2017,118 min,Logan Lucky,Rebecca Blunt,2017,7,"94,222","[{'Value': '7.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '92%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '78/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",logan lucky,Logan Lucky,Bleecker Street,518.0,-50.0,23.0,23.0,27778642.0,81.0,17476.0

(The film is a sequel to Mr. Trueba’s “The Girl of Your Dreams,” from 1998, about a Third Reich engagement with Spanish showbiz.) In “Queen,” an opening montage evoking newsreels describes Franco’s invitation to American studios to shoot in Spain.Penélope Cruz, who also starred in “The Girl of Your Dreams,” is back as Macarena Granada, now a Hollywood superstar who, having acquired American citizenship, returns to her native Spain for a lavish American-Spanish coproduction about Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Blas Fontiveros (Antonio Resines), a former director exiled in France (and an ex-paramour of Macarena’s), has sneaked back into the Spanish industry, working second-unit. After he is discovered by the authorities, Blas is banished to a labor camp, and a group that includes Macarena, her assistant (Loles Léon), married crew hands (Santiago Segura and Neus Asensi) and a bumbling actor (Jorge Sanz) must smuggle him back to France.Mr. Trueba skillfully blends genuine and mock period footage to conjure the era, while Mandy Patinkin, as a blacklisted screenwriter; Cary Elwes, as a loutish American leading man; and Clive Revill, sending up John Ford, ably help represent the Hollywood contingent. As for Ms. Cruz, she luminously revisits the role of a screen diva who, when the country’s dictator visits the set, is not above telling him off in the most delightfully coarse of terms.","Penélope Cruz, Antonio Resines, Neus Asensi, Ana Belén",N/A,Spain,Fernando Trueba,"Comedy, Drama","Spanish, English",46,"Nearly twenty years after the events of ""The Girl of Your Dreams"", in the 1950s, Macarena Granada, who has become a Hollywood star, returns to Spain to film a blockbuster about Queen Isabella I of Castile.",N/A,N/A,"[{'Value': '5.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",18 Aug 2017,128 min,The Queen of Spain,Fernando Trueba,2016,5.1,"1,096","[{'Value': '5.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '46/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the queen of spain,,,,,,,,,
196,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,The Hitman's Bodyguard,"Review: ‘The Hitman’s Bodyguard,’ With Samuel L. Jackson",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/movies/the-hitmans-bodyguard-review.html,2017-08-18,2017-08-16,Mr. Jackson is an ill-tempered contract killer. Ryan Reynolds is his uptight protector. You can figure out the rest.,"Samuel L. Jackson is the hit man. Ryan Reynolds is the bodyguard. What more do you want me to say? These two sometime residents of different branches of the greater Marvel cosmos — Nick Fury and Deadpool, if you need reminding — join up, with ostentatious reluctance, on a European jaunt, leaving a trail of dead minions and flummoxed law enforcement officers from Manchester to The Hague. Their common nemesis is an Eastern European despot, a genocidal maniac with a scholarly mien and personal touch played, it seems almost redundant to point out, by Gary Oldman.“The Hitman’s Bodyguard,” directed by Patrick Hughes (“The Expendables 3”) and written by Tom O’Connor, is not a good movie, but, in fairness, it doesn’t try to be. It occupies its genre niche — the exuberantly violent Euro-action movie-star-paycheck action comedy — without excessive cynicism or annoying pretension. The stars banter and bicker and wax sentimental about the badass women in their lives (Salma Hayek and Élodie Yung) until the time arrives for the next shootout or car chase or suite of explosions.These range from tedious to wildly overblown to kind of fun. A hot pursuit in and along the canals of Amsterdam — with Mr. Jackson in a speedboat, Mr. Reynolds on a motorbike and the bad guys in black cars — brings a few jolts and gasps, even if the digital seams in the sequence peek out intermittently. A bout of tool-assisted hand-to-hand combat in a hardware store makes up in efficiency for what it lacks in originality. The final blowup and showdown destroy whatever sense of proportion the movie might have had, along with a lot of Dutch infrastructure.Mr. Jackson plays Darius Kincaid, a fearsome contract killer cooperating with the authorities to free his wife (Ms. Hayek) from prison. Mr. Reynolds is Michael Bryce, a formerly “triple-A”-rated security specialist whose career and relationship (with Ms. Yung’s Interpol agent) went south after he lost a client. One of these fellows is an uptight, cautious, detail-oriented professional, while the other has a looser, more improvisational style. No points for guessing which is which, or for predicting who learns what from whom.Darius, despite a résumé piled high with dead and maimed bodies, is more righteous avenger than sociopath. This, too, is no surprise. A least since “Pulp Fiction,” Mr. Jackson has made a specialty of playing murderers touched by a curious sense of moral grace. Mr. Reynolds, for his part, is comfortable and credible as a smart, suave young punk in need of a bit of schooling. Mr. Jackson lays claim to most of the good lines and the big scenes, but no one can complain about that.Michael, however, does object to Darius’s reliance on a certain 12-letter expletive. “You ruined it,” he whines, supplying this otherwise blunt, none-too-clever movie with a morsel of meta-humor. Every movie fan knows that Mr. Jackson didn’t exactly invent that multifaceted word, but in its modern phraseology, he is nonetheless something of a mythic figure.","Elodie Yung, Ryan Reynolds, Tsuwayuki Saotome, Roy Hill","$75,020,039","USA, Hong Kong, Bulgaria, Netherlands",Patrick Hughes,"Action, Comedy, Thriller","English, Russian, French, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Spanish",47,"The world's top bodyguard gets a new client, a hitman who must testify at the International Criminal Court.

The jokes are thin, the computer animation is wanting and the inane plot is a series of set pieces strung together.The critters, led by a dour squirrel named Surly (Will Arnett), are in danger of losing their city park home thanks to an egomaniacal mayor (Bobby Moynihan) with a Texan accent who plans to build a shoddy amusement park over the sanctioned greenscape.You don’t need to see the first “Nut Job” movie to follow the sequel’s nonsensical plot and the script’s preference for bottom-shelf puns. The film’s meanspirited tone picks on both creatures and humans, like construction workers for being illiterate, animals almost too dumb to survive and the wicked rich.Apart from Mr. Arnett’s Surly, no other animal gets more than a few scraps of screen time, including Jackie Chan as the leader of a Chinatown mice gang and Bobby Cannavale as a dimwitted pup. Surly’s relationship with his love interest, Andie (Katherine Heigl), plays out like a Goofus and Gallant comic strip in which he does things the easy way while she moralizes about the importance of hard work and coddles Surly through his tantrums.The director Cal Brunker, previously a storyboard artist for “Despicable Me,” does not bring the warmth of that movie to this effort. Mr. Brunker, who wrote the script with five other people, fashions “Nut Job 2” as its own dull amusement park ride, where slapdash animation, a dismal story and a score by Heitor Pereira repeated ad infinitum makes for few thrills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like the NASA team that produced these spacecraft, it inspires awe.","For any believer in humankind’s instinct to transcend boundaries, the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes, and the NASA team that produced them, inspire awe. “The Farthest,” a dazzling documentary written and directed by Emer Reynolds, illustrates why.Consider: In 1977, the pair were launched (two, to increase the odds of success); in 1979 Voyager 1 began relaying information from Jupiter, and in 1980 approached Saturn and its moon Titan, nearly a billion miles from Earth. In 1986, Voyager 2 reached Uranus, and three years later Neptune. In 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to exit our solar system and enter interstellar space, from which it still sends signals. (Voyager 2 is en route.)The accounts of scientists, whose enthusiasm still glows, is as wondrous as the technology seen here. Linda Morabito, a navigation engineer, recalls discovering gas plumes on Jupiter’s moon Io. “I had the first evidence of active volcanism beyond Earth,” she says, beaming. Time-lapse Voyager-eye views of planets as they get nearer convey a sense of the epiphanies experienced in mission control.And there is catnip for dreamers, in the form of the so-called golden record enclosed on both vessels. “A message in a bottle into the ocean,” says Jim Bell, author of “The Interstellar Age” — and to alien life-forms that might find it. Each disc (complete with instructions) includes, among other things, photos; diagrams; greetings in 53 languages; 27 pieces of music from different cultures, including “Johnny B. Goode”; and the song of a humpback whale.“We did something really, really great,” Brad Smith, an imaging specialist, says of the 40-year adventure.

199,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Nocturama,"Review: In ‘Nocturama,’ Bored, Beautiful Terrorists With a Taste for Luxury Brands",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/nocturama-review-bertrand-bonello.html,2017-08-11,2017-08-10,"Bertrand Bonello’s “Nocturama” chronicles a dramatic attack in Paris, with remarkably little resonance with current events.","“Nocturama” might be an interesting movie about terrorism if there were no such thing as terrorism. If, that is, politically motivated shootings and bombings in big cities were fantastical tropes or metaphorical conceits, like zombie epidemics or extraterrestrial invasions. But perhaps “interesting” is too strong a word. Without a real-world correlative for the actions it depicts, Bertrand Bonello’s new film would merely be tedious and pretentious rather than repellent.There is no denying that Mr. Bonello, whose previous films include “House of Pleasures” (a prurient peek behind the scenes at an early-20th-century bordello) and “Saint Laurent” (a salacious tour of ’70s couture), possesses cinematic skill and suavity to spare. The story told in “Nocturama” splits neatly into before and after, with a few flashbacks thrown in for clarity and variety. The first half follows a collection of young French people as they prepare to carry out a series of attacks in Paris; the second stays with them in the immediate aftermath, as they kill time in a high-end department store.Part 1 is fast-moving and suspenseful, Part 2 languorous and luxuriant. The young terrorists are brisk and businesslike until the plastic explosives detonate. Then they act out a parody of jaded consumerist hedonism, browsing among the brand names. Nike, Fendi, Issey Miyake — Mr. Bonello places the products so lovingly in the frame that you might think he was being paid to do it.Really, though, all he advertises is the vacuity of his imagination, which he mistakes for the moral emptiness of his characters and the society that spawned them. They are not — or not all — drawn from its margins or its oppressed groups. A few of the conspirators (there are eight in all, plus an inside man at the store) seem to be children of immigrants from suburban housing projects. The others come from France’s middle and upper classes. One of the leaders is a student at an elite university, with family connections to the minister of the interior, whose office is among the group’s targets.Other targets include the chief executive of a bank, a row of parked cars, a gilded equestrian statue and a skyscraper with the word “global” conveniently displayed near its crown. The cause that motivates this violence is never specified. One member of the gang is a Muslim who doesn’t drink alcohol and believes he will be welcomed in paradise as a martyr, but religious extremism doesn’t seem to be part of the overall agenda. Nor does any recognizable political ideology or economic grievance. “It was bound to happen,” a bored-sounding young woman says to a perpetrator who has wandered out for a cigarette.Her fatalism mirrors the nihilism behind the act, and also the chilly abstraction that characterizes Mr. Bonello’s approach to a potentially volatile subject. As they try on fancy clothes and fiddle with wide-screen televisions and top-of-the-line sound equipment, the young rebels prove themselves to be perfect citizens of the system they supposedly hate. They don’t really want to overthrow it or force it to change, but rather to make some noise, to feel as if they’ve done something.An older generation of French radicals used to speak of the “propaganda of the deed” — the idea that violent or disruptive action can function as a vehicle of political meaning. Today’s terrorists are partly the inheritors of this notion, sending dramatic, lethal messages to enemies and sympathizers alike. For Mr. Bonello’s cadre of good-looking militants, deeds are more like marketing slogans, expressions of a free-floating aesthetic of tedium and mild stimulation.He treats them with a mixture of solicitude and detachment that reveals its cruelty by degrees. The closer they come to their inevitable bloody end, the more human these mixed-up kids appear. We learn their names, and see evidence of tenderness and folly as well as steely heartlessness. They’re so normal! But that revelation is really just confirmation of Mr. Bonello’s shallow cynicism, his facile conviction that he has built a trap for the audience’s conscience rather than a useless, self-consuming artifact. When the ruthless, faceless power of the state finally asserts itself, what is meant to be a shocking climax merits little more than a nod and a shrug. What took so long? There’s nothing political about that response: Like “Nocturama,” it’s nothing but an expression of aesthetic ennui.","Finnegan Oldfield, Vincent Rottiers, Hamza Meziani, Manal Issa",N/A,"France, Germany, Belgium",Bertrand Bonello,"Drama, Thriller",French,71,"Some young folks, tired of the society they're living in, plan a bomb attack over Paris before to take shelter for a night in a shopping center.",N/A,Grasshopper Film,"[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",08 Sep 2017,130 min,Nocturama,Bertrand Bonello,2016,6.6,"2,767","[{'Value': '6.6/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '88%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '71/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",nocturama,,,,,,,,,

Heaven knows he needs one: An aspiring writer who equates rebellion with a downscale ZIP code and a whining contempt for the financial success of his father, Ethan (Pierce Brosnan), Thomas moons over a gorgeous young woman (Kiersey Clemons) and frets over his emotionally fragile mother (a warm Cynthia Nixon). He probably also needs a therapist, preferably a Freudian, to unravel why he’s obsessively stalking his father’s mistress, Johanna (Kate Beckinsale).Burdened by thuddingly obvious musical choices (including Simon & Garfunkel’s gorgeous title song and, for crying out loud, Dylan’s “Visions of Johanna”), Allan Loeb’s script is glib and grating. The way is cleared for W. F., with his aura of slovenly glamour and precise knowledge of the cooking temperature of heroin, to steal the show. But Mr. Turner holds his own, gamely countering his strong resemblance to the young Richard Gere with a performance of perplexed immaturity.Everyone, in fact, works hard to transcend the artifice, and they deserve better.

Sandberg proves to be a master of the flash-scare as he strings together jolts in this prequel to the 2014 film “Annabelle.”,"“Annabelle: Creation” is the third cinematic outing for the demon-hosting doll of the title, after a guest spot on “The Conjuring” in 2013 and a star turn the next year in “Annabelle.” The narratives lurch backward, with each film acting as a prequel to its predecessor. Should this trend continue, we could very well see one of Annabelle’s ancestors causing catastrophic delays in the building of the pyramids.For now, though, we’re in the 1940s as a doll maker and his wife (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) suffer the loss of their beloved daughter. A dozen years later, he’s a shuffling shell and she’s a disfigured recluse; so they open their rambling California farmhouse to a young nun and a clutch of orphaned girls. Wake up, Annabelle, your victims are here! Might I suggest you begin with the little one with the leg brace?And so she does, terrorizing the youngsters in cheekily effective scenes while their host hovers ineffectually on the fringes and his wife cowers behind her bed curtains. Gary Dauberman’s script is lamentably light on mythological details (can the demon survive indefinitely outside the doll, or does it have a curfew?), but its vacuousness allows the director, David F. Sandberg, to string together jolts any way he pleases.As with last year’s “Lights Out,” he proves a master of the flash-scare, a nifty choreographer of precipitous timing and striptease visuals. But he’s also adroit with more leisurely horrors, like the snap-crackle-pop of the murderous shade flexing for the kill, or the slow animation of a sacklike scarecrow into a toothy obscenity.In this kind of horror movie, no one ever seems to hear you scream.","Anthony LaPaglia, Samara Lee, Miranda Otto, Brad Greenquist","$101,788,793",USA,David F.

That way, the therapeutic calm instilled by the glorious Iberian scenery (photographed by James Clarke in shimmering, almost edible pastels) could be savored uninterrupted by the performative patter of the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. I imagine that the diners seated near them in the restaurants where much of this movie takes place would have been grateful for mute buttons of their own.Like “The Trip” in 2011 and “The Trip to Italy” three years later, this latest cushy assignment sends the lads — once again playing Steve and Rob, mildly fictionalized versions of themselves — tootling around a randomly chosen region, sampling menus and trading banter. I hesitate to say jokes, because, unlike the bounce and zing of the first movie, the tone here is more sober and the humor more strained. Barely squeaking by on a familiar formula and flimsy narrative (Steve is writing a book; Rob is scribbling restaurant reviews for The New York Times), the actors convey a sense of going through the motions. Eating sumptuous meals without apparent relish, jogging separately through impossibly gorgeous towns, and firing off celebrity impersonations with wearying one-upmanship, they perform with the competitive reflexivity of the longtime double act.Yet even artists as gifted as these two can only hitchhike so long on the charisma of household names like Mick Jagger and Michael Caine, and the dueling impressions that fuel the franchise have become effortful and repetitive. (One extended bit on Roger Moore is tortured to the point of desperation.) And though the spaces between the funny voices are filled with verdant hillsides and vanilla beaches that stretch the length of the frame, there’s an occasional sour edge to the comedic sparring.This comes almost entirely from Steve, whose midlife anxieties — including an elusive, married lover and a neglectful agent — are the burr under the movie’s saddle. Plagued by disturbing dreams and career frustrations, he becomes increasingly distracted and crabby, until every comic utterance feels like a shot across the bow of mortality. This poignancy makes the picture less humorous but potentially more substantive than its predecessors. And as the men imagine themselves Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (daftly abetted by Noel Harrison’s 1960s hit “The Windmills of Your Mind”), the film’s failure to engage with these discomforts feels like a missed opportunity.Instead, Mr. Winterbottom and his team — by means of an extremely strange ending — appear to be setting us up for a Trip to Morocco.

It’s unusual to see such excellence in costumes, sets and cinematography lavished on this degree of narrative muddle.Written by the director, Rebecca Zlotowski, and Robin Campillo — of “The Class” and “BPM (Beats Per Minute),” a recent Cannes prizewinner — this film, mostly set in the 1930s, stars Natalie Portman and Lily-Rose Depp as Laura and Kate Barlow, a spiritualist sister act from the United States. On the Paris stop of their European tour, they give a private séance to a film producer, André Korben (Emmanuel Salinger). As Laura notices, his accent suggests he isn’t from France originally. (Ms. Portman speaks many of her lines in what sounds like credible French.)André becomes eager to film the mediums at work, with the hope of recording evidence of a spectral presence. (And to paraphrase a professor in the film, cinema — even without actual wraiths — is an invention that captures the ghosts of the future.) André also offers the sisters residence in his home, in an arrangement fraught with class tension.But much of what happens next — romance, illness — seems arbitrary, as characters come and go without proper introductions. Tidiness isn’t crucial, but watching “Planetarium” often feels like making contact with fragments of a great three-hour movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its directors, Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis, are novice filmmakers, true; but I also suspect this movie’s form is deliberate, part of its message. This is direct and frequently powerful filmmaking that doesn’t much care about meeting my aesthetic standards.“Whose Streets?” takes off from the night Mr. Brown was shot. One of the movie’s subjects is David Whitt, a resident of the apartment complex on the street where the shooting took place, who is moved to take his video camera onto the streets to record police action as rioting started. Another thread follows Brittany Ferrell and Alexis Templeton, a couple navigating parenthood and school, and putting themselves at considerable risk as they lead and participate in demonstrations like one in which they formed a human chain to block traffic on a highway.The movie is punctuated with quotes by black historical figures — Martin Luther King Jr.’s observation that “a riot is the language of the unheard” is particularly resonant. Much of the footage is from low-resolution video cameras and cellphones; the most professional-looking material here is from a television interview with Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown, in which he says, “You can’t perform the duties of a police officer and have racism in you.” This is shown in the same section that features on-the-fly shots of off-duty St. Louis police officers puffing their chests at activists at a town hall meeting. Another wrenching scene shows a protester trying to address a black female officer, the only person of color in a defensive line of cops; she holds her position even as tears fill her eyes.","Lezley McSpadden, Michael Brown Sr., David Whitt, Montague Simmons","$180,214",USA,"Sabaah Folayan, Damon Davis(co-director)",Documentary,English,81,Whose Streets? is an unflinching look at how the killing of 18-year-old Mike Brown inspired a community to fight back and sparked a global movement.,R,Magnolia Pictures,"[{'Value': '4.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",11 Aug 2017,90 min,Whose Streets?,Sabaah Folayan,2017,4.9,871,"[{'Value': '4.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '98%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '81/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",whose streets?,,,,,,,,,
205,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Good Time,"Review: A ‘Good Time,’ if in Name Only",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/good-time-review-robert-pattinson.html,2017-08-11,2017-08-10,"Robert Pattinson plays a not-too-bright bank robber on the run in Josh and Benny Safdie’s latest film, “Good Time.”","Nick and Connie Nikas are brothers, like Josh and Benny Safdie, the directors of “Good Time.” Nick — played by Benny Safdie — is mentally disabled, while Connie (Robert Pattinson) might charitably be described as an idiot. Motivated by a volatile mix of desperation and bravado, he involves Nick in a poorly planned, haphazardly executed bank robbery. You can bet money on a disastrous outcome, though you might not foresee the precise sequence of mayhem and farce that unfolds on the streets of Queens over a single freezing night. The caper includes an after-hours visit to an amusement park, a soda bottle full of LSD, a case of mistaken identity and plenty of chases, beatings and narrow escapes.The Safdies are as clever and crafty as Connie is inept and impulsive. “Good Time,” their third co-directed fictional feature — after the autobiographical “Daddy Longlegs” and the addiction romance “Heaven Knows What” — moves smartly and propulsively to the stressed-out strains of Daniel Lopatin’s edge-of-a-heart-attack score. The smudgy, grimy urban landscape — emergency rooms, fast-food restaurants, blocks of modest, over-mortgaged, squeezed-together houses — is shot (by Sean Price Williams) with a fastidious avoidance of prettiness. The story doesn’t twist and turn so much as squirm and jump like an eel in the bottom of a rowboat. The biggest surprises confirm what an unbelievable slimeball Connie is. He’s about as hard to root for as any movie outlaw you can think of.And yet, partly because Mr. Pattinson’s movie-star incandescence can’t quite be obscured by facial hair and bad lighting, and partly because of the immutable laws of genre and spectacle, you sort of have no choice but to root for him. You’re stuck with him, and you might as well make the best of it. The Safdies have explored this kind of ambiguity before. In “Daddy Longlegs,” the wayward father, played by Ronald Bronstein (a character based on their own father), was appalling and charming in almost equal measure; his charisma both enabled and camouflaged his wanton irresponsibility. You might have recoiled in horror at his recklessness, but you couldn’t deny that he loved his kids.Connie, for his part, adores his brother and has a way with dogs. While these traits don’t exactly make him likable, they grant him a minimal benefit of the doubt. His manipulation of his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) isn’t nice, but on the other hand she is so whiny and needy that you can’t feel too bad. Connie also has the good luck (at least as far as the audience’s good graces are concerned) of falling in with the one guy in Queens who could make him look like a criminal genius — a gangly doofus named Ray (Buddy Duress), who has been spending his first days out of jail aggressively pursuing the opposite of rehabilitation.This pair is not exactly Butch and Sundance, even in their own addled, delusional minds. And while Ray is hapless and almost heroically stupid, Connie is a more complicated, less clownish figure. He has a hint of heart, as well as a cruel, predatory streak that the Safdies’ expose for shocks and laughs, daring you to either take offense or take the joke, and banking on your queasiness in either case.It doesn’t take much looking to notice an ugly racial dimension in Connie’s behavior, though most critics overlooked it when the film was shown in Cannes this spring. When the Nikas brothers carry out the bank job, they wear hard hats, reflective vests and dark latex masks that function as crude, criminal blackface. Later, Connie takes advantage of a Caribbean immigrant (Gladys Mathon) and her granddaughter (Taliah Lennice Webster), sweet-talking and bullying them into aiding and abetting him. A black security guard (Barkhad Abdi) becomes another brutally abused pawn in Connie’s senseless game.This pattern does not seem accidental. The question is what it means — what degree of self-consciousness or critical distance “Good Time” brings to its depiction of bottom-of-the-barrel white privilege. You could infer a satirical dimension if you wanted to, or even a righteous indictment of what a lowlife can get away with if he has Mr. Pattinson’s complexion. Or you could look at the film’s riot of racial signifiers — the musical and pop-cultural references as well as the demographics of the setting — as a form of trolling, a coy, self-disavowing provocation.But the distinction doesn’t really matter, since the movie’s chief investment is not in the fates of any of its characters, nor in anything like realism, but rather in its own cool. Sometimes it flaunts its clichés — Nick’s disability, and Benny Safdie’s slack-jawed portrayal of it, is a big one — and other times it cloaks them in rough visual textures and jumpy, bumpy camera movements, so that a rickety genre thrill ride feels like something daring and new. It isn’t. It’s stale, empty and cold.","Robert Pattinson, Benny Safdie, Buddy Duress, Taliah Webster","$1,999,047",USA,"Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie","Crime, Drama, Thriller",English,80,"After a botched bank robbery lands his younger brother in prison, Connie Nikas embarks on a twisted odyssey through the city's underworld in an increasingly desperate-and dangerous-attempt to get his brother Nick out of jail.",R,A24,"[{'Value': '7.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",25 Aug 2017,101 min,Good Time,"Ronald Bronstein, Josh Safdie",2017,7.3,"45,021","[{'Value': '7.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '91%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '80/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",good time,Good Time,A24,2299.0,-10.0,6.0,383.0,2009484.0,63.0,17451.0

It turns out the bride wasn’t a friend, but merely encouraged Ingrid by commenting on one of her posts.Ingrid’s next fixation is Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), a social media gadfly. To get close to her, Ingrid moves to Los Angeles, visits a restaurant that Taylor has praised (repeating her order) and abducts Taylor’s dog as a pretext for returning it. As the two become besties, the movie makes the not-revelatory point that Taylor’s stage-managed life — including her dream of opening a boutique (“my Instagram, but in real life”) — is barely less fraudulent than Ingrid’s.Ms. Plaza is a whiz with timing and does a deft job of shifting viewers’ sympathy; her character can be loathsome or pathetic depending on the scene. O’Shea Jackson Jr., as her Batman-obsessed landlord, is every bit as funny and nearly walks away with the movie. Still, Mr. Spicer cops out by going with the obvious ending. Admittedly, he has tough competition. Real life already gave social media “influencers” a far more cutting sendup.

The plot has a factual basis: the relationship between a German TV journalist, Jürgen Hinzpeter, and the cabdriver who drove him from Seoul to the locked-down city of Gwangju, at the time a hotbed of pro-democracy student rebellion and violent repression. While the real-life name of the cabby and his ultimate fate are unclear (his name may have been Kim Sa-bok), the film calls him Kim Man-seob and gives him a poignant back story and destiny.Kim (Song Kang-ho) is a garrulous if gruff widowed father to an 11-year-old girl, impatient with traffic jams resulting from protests in Seoul. If it weren’t for the back rent he owes, he wouldn’t need to take Hinzpeter (Thomas Kretschmann) to the besieged Gwangju. But when he does, they witness a huge street demonstration that is met with tear gas and military brutality. The soft-spoken Hinzpeter is determined to smuggle footage of the dictatorship’s abuses to a German news organization, while the heretofore neutral Kim comes to realize the urgency of Hinzpeter’s mission.The film climaxes with a breathless escape from Gwangju, as Kim and Hinzpeter elude government vehicles with the aid of other cabdrivers.

Here the filmmakers take a chance and turn a strange-seeming premise into a fast-moving tale.The bulk of the story is set in Ireland in 1209, where a group of monks safeguards a holy relic. A visitor, Geraldus (Stanley Weber), arrives with papal orders to bring this MacGuffin to Rome. Four of the monks and a secretive mute (Jon Bernthal, sullen and entrancing) are assigned to shepherd Geraldus and the relic across the country.This Ireland isn’t the land of Guinness, and green is in short supply; most scenes here are steeped in shades of gray, matching the film’s forbidding mood. Enemies soon arrive to steal the relic, and the chases begin.The youngest monk, Diarmuid (Tom Holland, in a robe instead of the tights he wears as the new Spider-Man), is reliably good-hearted, the better to contrast with Raymond (Richard Armitage), one of the brutal bad guys. John Lynch, Ruaidhri Conroy and Hugh O’Conor, all convincing, play the other three monks.Brendan Muldowney, the director, and Jamie Hannigan, the screenwriter, keep something happening in each scene; the pace is swift, except for shots of misty hills and shadowy forests that are lingered over as the ominous score moans. The main battle is an exercise in Grand Guignol, with swords, arrows and axes impaling faces and severing limbs.Amid that gore (including a harsh stoning — not that there’s any other kind — and an exciting yet vicious conclusion), “Pilgrimage” raises a question or two about unexamined beliefs and religious zeal.

209,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,The Glass Castle,Review: Woody Harrelson as a Wild and Crazy Dad in ‘The Glass Castle’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/review-the-glass-castle.html,2017-08-11,2017-08-10,"Adapted from Jeannette Walls’s best-selling memoir of her chaotic childhood, a movie decides to play it safe.","“The Glass Castle” wrestles with two conflicting impulses: the longing for order and the desire for wildness. The main object of that ambivalence is Rex Walls, a big-talking, big-dreaming ne’er-do-well played with the usual guile and gusto by Woody Harrelson.Rex would qualify as a helicopter parent if that phrase referred to someone who encouraged his kid to pilot a chopper without proper training or safety equipment. If he and his wife, Rose Mary (Naomi Watts), don’t go quite that far, it may only be for lack of available aircraft. Their four children are, to use another slightly anachronistic idiom in reference to a story set mostly in the ’60s and ’70s, decidedly free range. At a swimming pool, Rex throws Jeannette, his second-oldest daughter, into deep water to teach her to swim. That’s hardly the craziest thing he does, but it’s a convenient metaphor for his approach to parenting.Jeannette, played in middle childhood by a wonderfully shrewd and watchful young actress named Ella Anderson, will grow up to be played by Brie Larson and to grapple with adulthood in late-’80s New York, where she writes a gossip column. Eventually, she’ll also write a best-selling memoir of her hectic childhood, which has now been adapted into this uneven, conscientious film, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and written by Mr. Cretton and Andrew Lanham.Lacking the book’s episodic sprawl and psychological nuance, their movie clings to its essential tension. Jeannette, her father’s favorite — his nickname for her is Mountain Goat — admires her parents’ free-spirited individualism even as she suffers amid the chaos of their chosen way of life. Money is always short, and the family often picks up and moves, one step ahead of bill collectors or law enforcement. Rose Mary paints landscapes, still lifes and portraits, while Rex, bouncing from job to job, conjures fantastical, almost-practical projects, like the solar-powered mansion that gives the movie its title.The clan’s nomadic period, which takes up roughly the first half of Ms. Walls’s memoir, is truncated on screen, and the audience never gets a full dose of the paternal wanderlust that provides Jeannette’s childhood with its thrills and terrors. We spend more time in Welch, W.Va., Rex’s Appalachian hometown, to which he had vowed never to return. Once there, in the shadow of his sinister mother, Erma (Robin Bartlett), Rex starts drinking more and dreaming less. As his charm dissolves, he devolves from a mischievous daredevil into a ranting, tyrannical drunk.Meanwhile, in the film’s back-and-forth time scheme, adult Jeannette tries to find a place for her past (and her parents, who are now squatting on Manhattan’s pre-gentrified Lower East Side) in her polished, professional existence. What this mostly means is trying to reconcile her attachment to Rex with her engagement to David, a sacrificial yuppie played by Max Greenfield. He’s not a bad guy, he just cares about money, material possessions and what other people think. All of that makes him, somewhat too obviously, Rex’s opposite.While Jeannette’s attempt to deal with the men in her life provides “The Glass Castle” with a bit of drama (and some comic scenes as well), it’s frustrating to see the resourceful Ms. Larson pinioned between two showy male performers. Jeannette, the central voice and consciousness in the book, is an oddly blurred character on screen. And the film itself loses focus as it drifts toward the conventions of the coming-of-age story and the family-dysfunction melodrama.Conformity wins out in the end. Not that Rex — or the indefatigable Mr. Harrelson — is ever really tamed. But Mr. Lanham and Mr. Cretton, who proved himself a sensitive, risk-taking filmmaker with “Short Term 12” (also starring Ms. Larson), couldn’t find a way to contain both the father’s anarchy and the daughter’s skeptical affection for him. The movie bogs down in dialogue-heavy obvious scenes, some of which refer to events in the book that didn’t make it onto the screen. It’s both too tidy and too messy, and at the same time neither quite wild nor quite sensible enough.","Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts, Ella Anderson","$17,238,739",USA,Destin Daniel Cretton,"Biography, Drama",English,56,A young girl comes of age in a dysfunctional family of nonconformist nomads with a mother who's an eccentric artist and an alcoholic father who would stir the children's imagination with hope as a distraction to their poverty.,PG-13,Lionsgate,"[{'Value': '7.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",11 Aug 2017,127 min,The Glass Castle,"Destin Daniel Cretton (screenplay by), Andrew Lanham (screenplay by), Jeannette Walls (based upon the book by)",2017,7.2,"17,112","[{'Value': '7.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '50%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '56/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the glass castle,The Glass Castle,Lionsgate,9470.0,2.0,113.0,84.0,17273059.0,63.0,17451.0

The married Boris and Marie are breaking up but for economic reasons are still sharing the same living space (to which the entire movie is confined; good thing there’s an outdoor patio). They have lovely twin daughters in front of whom they mostly argue — vehemently and with little regard for how these displays will affect the girls. Money is an issue; Marie comes from affluence, while Boris, a contractor who refers to himself as an architect, rarely has any. He incessantly confronts Marie over the labor he’s put into their apartment.Marie, a narrowly conceived character nevertheless played well by Bérénice Bejo, is uptight and withholding; Boris, by turns warmly bearish and broadly truculent as played by Cédric Kahn, is controlling and manipulative, not to mention aggressively self-pitying. When he responds sympathetically to Marie’s vulnerability, it’s hard to tell if he is being sincere in his affection, or just exploiting a weakness. (Marthe Keller makes a welcome contribution as Marie’s mother, whose voice-of-experience advice to her daughter falls on willfully deaf ears.)Not unlike an expensively tattooed panhandler, the couple elicit only a skeptical kind of sympathy. The American filmmaker John Cassavetes was able to make this kind of hate-love-hate scenario compulsively watchable (in movies like “A Woman Under the Influence”), partly because he made his characters operatically brash, their actions relentlessly emotionally combustible. “After Love,” written by Mazarine Pingeot, Fanny Burdino and Mr. Lafosse, and originally titled the less evocative but frankly more apt “L’économie du couple,” is too polite by half ever to generate any such sparks.","Bérénice Bejo, Cédric Kahn, Marthe Keller, Jade Soentjens","$13,621","France, Belgium",Joachim Lafosse,Drama,French,66,"After 15 years of marriage, a couple with two kids is about to divorce.

211,GLENN KENNY,1,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Wind River,Review: Murder Mystery on the Reservation in ‘Wind River’,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/movies/wind-river-review-jeremy-renner-elizabeth-olsen.html,2017-08-04,2017-08-03,A rookie investigator meets her match while investigating a murder on an Indian reservation.,"Taylor Sheridan, the screenwriter of last year’s socially conscious crime drama “Hell or High Water,” proves an undeniably strong director with his second effort in that job, “Wind River.” The movie opens on a breathtaking night sky and snow-capped mountains, with a young woman running over a long stretch of open land. “There’s a meadow in my perfect world,” a female voice says. The juxtaposition of the imagery and the poetics make for a peculiar opening. Eventually it all makes tragic sense.Here, Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. He seems on intimate terms with the residents there; his ex-wife, with whom he has a young son and had a daughter, is a Native American with family on the reservation. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds a corpse frozen in the mountain snow. The dead young woman, who suffered a head injury and was also raped, was the best friend of Cory’s daughter, who died three years earlier under similar circumstances.Homicide on an Indian reservation, as it happens, is a federal crime. The F.B.I. — which, going by the attitude of the reservation’s quiet police chief, is consistently less helpful than it should be — dispatches Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a seemingly very green agent, to head the investigation. She shows up wearing an F.B.I. windbreaker, and Cory calmly informs her that she’ll be dead within five minutes if she goes up the mountain dressed like that.“See what they send us,” one resident says mournfully, shaking his head. In a different movie, the introduction of Jane and Cory would be a meet-cute. But Mr. Sheridan, who also avoided injecting a romantic theme into his script for “Sicario,” in which Emily Blunt played an F.B.I. operative, has different, more serious reasons for making this character a woman. Jane acts partly as an audience surrogate, a well-intentioned outsider whose empathy and sincere desire to act on behalf of the female murder victim only gets her so far.The case lights up a cold fury in Cory. He reassures the victim’s father, “I’m a hunter.” He demonstrates to Jane that in this terrain, it’s the landscape that will yield the most important answers, not the frequently recalcitrant Indians whom Jane wants to interview. He’s right, of course, and his wisdom is borne out in some gut-wrenching ways.Under David Mackenzie’s direction, “Hell or High Water” tended to overstate its hard-times-in-the-United-States theme; it seemed that every fifth shot or so showed a house foreclosure sale sign or a bankruptcy lawyer’s billboard. As a director, Mr. Sheridan is a little more subtle than Mr. Mackenzie. This is kind of surprising; frequently, writers turned directors really like to bring the hammer down on their subtexts. But Mr. Sheridan limits himself to one shot of an American flag being flown upside down. Other than that, he lets the terrible situation on the reservation speak for itself. An actor before he was a screenwriter, Mr. Sheridan clearly spent a lot of his time learning about filmmaking on movie sets; his direction is assured throughout. A standoff scene near the movie’s finale would not be shamed if put next to one of Michael Mann’s better set pieces.The performances Mr. Sheridan draws from his cast are all excellent. Mr. Renner, who’s been spending too much of his career imparting convincing humanity to a second-tier Marvel superhero, is in excellent form as Cory. Ms. Olsen, who has been co-starring in those Marvel films with Mr. Renner, is sympathetic as Jane. Graham Greene brings his customary quiet power and dry wit to the role of the police chief.The movie builds to a shocking climax, even though the revelation of the bad guys makes immediate, sickening sense. The film’s ultimate statement sinks in later, with an expanded awareness that the justice done by the good guys in this film is not nearly sufficient with respect to the larger injustice done to Native Americans.","Kelsey Asbille, Jeremy Renner, Julia Jones, Teo Briones","$33,782,714","UK, Canada, USA",Taylor Sheridan,"Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller",English,73,A veteran hunter helps an FBI agent investigate the murder of a young woman on a Wyoming Native American reservation.,R,The Weinstein Company,"[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",18 Aug 2017,107 min,Wind River,Taylor Sheridan,2017,7.7,"147,197","[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '86%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '73/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",wind river,Wind River,Weinstein Co.,254.0,18.0,9.0,28.0,33800859.0,126.0,17507.0

Columbus’s claim to fame — other than being Vice President Mike Pence’s hometown — is that it’s an unlikely haven for modernist architecture. Through a combination of patronage and civic courtship, this southern Indiana city became a home to structures by Eliel Saarinen, I. M. Pei, Robert A. M. Stern, Richard Meier and many others.Against this backdrop, Kogonada, a video essayist who has made artful film-analysis shorts for the Criterion Collection and Sight & Sound magazine, has shot a modest two-hander, using the architecture as a springboard for larger questions, much as his shorts are meta-riffs on the movies of Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Linklater. To his characters, a church and a bank by Eero Saarinen (Eliel Saarinen’s son) are everything and nothing.Jin (John Cho), an English-to-Korean book translator in Seoul, travels to Columbus after his father, an architecture historian, collapses while in town for a talk. As Jin waits to find out whether his semi-estranged father will ever regain consciousness, he strikes up a friendship with Casey (Haley Lu Richardson), a tour guide and lifelong Columbus resident. A year out of high school, she is tempted to leave to study architecture, but she fears for the well-being of her unpredictable blue-collar mother (Michelle Forbes), for whom she cooks and essentially looks after.Over several days, as Casey and Jin wander the sites, they debate such heady ideas as the healing power of buildings, modernism’s relationship to religion, and why — or whether — architecture means something to them. (“You grow up around something and it feels like nothing,” Jin says.) Kogonada also introduces parallel not-quite love interests: for Casey, a librarian (Rory Culkin) whose disquisition on the relative interest of video games and books may be intended as advice on how to watch this film; for Jin, a colleague of his father’s (Parker Posey) on whom he had a crush as a teenager.The acknowledged influence of the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu looms over the proceedings. Kogonada draws not only on Ozu’s frequent theme of generational conflict but also on his shooting style. (Like Ozu, he often “crosses the line,” violating the conventions of how the camera is positioned relative to the characters in a scene.) The found backgrounds are as suggestive as the dialogue, with the director often observing his actors through doorways and mirrors.“Columbus” can be slyly mysterious from a structural standpoint, both with respect to the plot’s elisions and several cuts that demand that viewers fill in the blanks. The movie leaves quite a bit to the eye of the beholder, but it’s always worth looking at.","John Cho, Haley Lu Richardson, Parker Posey, Michelle Forbes","$892,778",USA,Kogonada,Drama,"English, Korean",89,"A Korean-born man finds himself stuck in Columbus, Indiana, where his architect father is in a coma.

The Colombian-Canadian director Lina Rodriguez, who lives in Toronto, observes the daily lives of a family of three in Bogotá. But after a midfilm rupture, the movie reveals that the seemingly uneventful first section was more consequential than it appeared. As such, “This Time Tomorrow” poses a hazard for any spoiler-conscious reviewer. It’s also more admirable in theory than it is illuminating in practice.The key to the film may lie in its second shot, of a father, Francisco (Francisco Zaldua), and his teenage daughter, Adelaida (Laura Osma), watching television. Adelaida lazily calls to her mother, Lena (Maruia Shelton), who is out of frame in the next room. Lena is variously shown as Adelaida’s comforter, advice-giver on boyfriends and occasional object of pique.But after Lena’s birthday, the screen fades to black. When the movie returns, Ms. Rodriguez cuts among a succession of downcast faces. It’s probably not saying too much to reveal that “This Time Tomorrow” concerns the shock of an unexpected death, and how the sudden absence changes the lives of the family members who remain.Although Ms. Rodriguez includes a certain amount of foreshadowing, both in the title and in dialogue, few films are so rigorous in trying to evoke a structuring absence. But the withholding of details necessary to engineer the initial lull backfires in the second half, when the lack of specificity leaves the characters ill defined.","Laura Osma, Maruia Shelton, Francisco Zaldua, Clara Monroy",N/A,"Colombia, Canada",Lina Rodriguez,Drama,Spanish,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"[{'Value': '5.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,85 min,This Time Tomorrow,Lina Rodriguez,2016,5.9,53,"[{'Value': '5.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",this time tomorrow,,,,,,,,,

Have you heard? On big screens across the nation women are behaving badly, really badly. And now, bringing up the rear of this summer raunch parade led by “Snatched,” “Rough Night” and “Girls Trip,” comes the rather tame “Fun Mom Dinner.” These mothers just want a night off for boozy shenanigans and some smoking in the girls’ room, which, of course, leads to harmless karaoke antics, mild flirtations, an Instagram faux pas and pot-induced paranoia.These gals don’t start out as reunited pals, though — they only know one another through their children’s school. There’s bad blood between Kate (Toni Collette), who’s too cool for the dreaded Mom circle, and Melanie (Bridget Everett), a brash taskmaster with strong feelings about traffic safety. They stand down after a few puffs of a peace pipe in the form of a marijuana vaporizer pen and some encouragement from the recently divorced Jamie (Molly Shannon), a social media oversharer, and the new-to-the-school Emily (Katie Aselton), whose marriage is in a rut.The director Alethea Jones, working from Julie Rudd’s thin script, opens with a dutiful montage of the women’s morning routines. (Cue the requisite baby poop disaster and the Go-Go’s singing “Head Over Heels.”) The continuous intercutting, however — must we keep checking in with the dads and kids? — eventually grows tiresome and distracting.All four actresses have a natural chemistry and manage to give some inner dimensions to these otherwise archetypal characters. Though Ms. Aselton’s Emily is only marginally more realized than the others, it’s Ms. Everett who delivers the most memorable lines (“Oprah and Gayle, care to open up the friendship circle?”) — not at all surprising for those familiar with Ms. Everett’s, um, less-than-wholesome wine-soaked cabaret stage work.","Rob Huebel, Caleb Paddock, Matthew Paddock, Toni Collette",N/A,USA,Alethea Jones,Comedy,English,46,"Four moms whose only common ground is their kids' preschool class, decide to get together for a harmless ""fun mom dinner.""",R,Voltage Pictures,"[{'Value': '5.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,81 min,Fun Mom Dinner,Julie Rudd,2017,5.1,"3,286","[{'Value': '5.1/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '33%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '46/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",fun mom dinner,,,,,,,,,

This feature debut of the writer and director Jérôme Reybaud opens with a baby-faced 30-something, Pierre (Pascal Cervo), training a phone flashlight on his lover Paul (Arthur Igual). He then leaves Paul’s Paris apartment and drives an Alfa Romeo into rural France. The fantasy of walking out on your life and aimlessly wandering around can beguile even the most contentedly domesticated among us.Pierre is also looking to quench a thirst. He regularly checks his Grindr app, and at a roadside restroom, scans the stall graffiti and calls a number advertising sex services. He also picks up people along the roadside, not for cruising purposes, but to be of help. The first is a middle-age woman who is booked to sing at a senior home. The characters encountered are a bit more colorful than the ones you are likely to come across in real life, but not so much that they seem overtly allegorical. As Pierre roams, Paul embarks on a quest of his own, traveling to the center of the country to look for his lover via concentric Grindr circles.Some of this story is mildly whimsical, and there are ramps into some kind of magical realism (a blizzard at the French-Italian border is a little far-fetched). There are a lot of shots from behind a car windshield. These are more allied with Vincent Gallo’s “The Brown Bunny” than with Monte Hellman’s more lyrical “Two-Lane Blacktop.” While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the “not for everybody” critical hedge.","Pascal Cervo, Arthur Igual, Fabienne Babe, Nathalie Richard",N/A,France,Jérôme Reybaud,"Comedy, Drama, Romance","French, English, Italian",73,"A man leaves his home unannounced, and spends four days wandering around France.",UNRATED,N/A,"[{'Value': '6.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,137 min,4 Days in France,"Jérôme Reybaud, Nicolas Restif de La Bretonne (verse: Vers & fragments), Henri Thomas (verse: Vers & fragments), Arthur Rimbaud (verse: Vers & fragments), Paul-Jean Toulet (verse: Vers & fragments), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (verse: Vers & fragments), André Breton (verse: Vers & fragments), Eugénie de Guétin (verse: Vers & fragments), Lorand Gaspar (verse: Vers & fragments), Charles Ier d'Orléans (verse: Vers & fragments), E.M.

You’ll know just how he feels. However inadvertently, those are the most relatable moments in this movie, and the closest its makers come to connecting with whoever’s still watching.Directed by Xavier Manrique from a script by Nicholas Schutt, the tale centers on Fenton (Shiloh Fernandez), a writer returning home to his parents (Mary-Louise Parker and Chris Noth) in Manhattan after a self-imposed exile on the West Coast. A fictional story he once wrote for The New Yorker, ostensibly about his girlfriend at the time, Jessie (Ashley Benson), and her family, wasn’t veiled enough, and they were greatly embarrassed.In the year or so since Fenton slunk away, Jessie met a new beau whom she is about to marry. By moping around her a few times and boozing a little, Fenton apparently seeks to win her back.It’s often an uphill battle for films about fiction writers — cerebral sorts who practice a static profession — and too frequently we see Fenton merely sitting and gazing at his open laptop, cursor blinking on a blank page. The premise here is already implausible: The days when a short piece of literary fiction could devastate a wide social circle are very likely gone. Worse yet, the stakes are always low for these high-income characters.Nobody seems to get genuinely sad or elated or — pick any emotion — in “Chronically Metropolitan,” making it tough for a viewer to do the same. One longs to praise Mr. Manrique for attempting a serious-minded story in this, his first feature.

That rural town was light-years away from the Manhattan home of the CBS studio, where Orson Welles was retelling H. G. Wells’s novel “The War of the Worlds” in an infamous radio production on Oct. 30, 1938. Those unaware that the broadcast was a work of fiction fell for Wells’s story of an alien invasion. Fear that it was real quickly set off a panic.In Jody Lambert’s lighthearted comedy “Brave New Jersey” panic is positive, pushing people to say or do things they may have never done under ordinary circumstances. Out of the ensuing chaos, the town’s bashful mayor (Tony Hale, from “Veep”) is forced to assert himself, and a pastor’s faith is challenged, as is the relationship between a schoolteacher and her new fiancé.Through its many cheerful characters, “Brave New Jersey” emanates an upbeat attitude of a James Stewart kind. With its warm filters and costumes, the movie emulates a period film, but its sharp digital cinematography is at odds with its softer, vintage aesthetic.Mr. Lambert, who wrote the screenplay with Michael Dowling, aims for a modest, old-fashioned yarn about a time when people believed in the news media. Even when word gets out that the Martian invasion announcement was just part of a radio show, not everyone listens as intently as they did to the original radio program and gossip. The film’s narrative simplicity can be charming or frustrating, depending on your feelings about awkward dialogue and overreacting actors.","Anna Camp, Sam Jaeger, Heather Burns, Evan Jonigkeit","$14,105",USA,Jody Lambert,Comedy,English,45,"A comedy about a small New Jersey town on the night of Orson Welles' legendary 1938 ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast, which led millions of listeners to believe the U.S. was being invaded by Martians.",TV-MA,Gravitas Ventures,"[{'Value': '5.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,86 min,Brave New Jersey,"Michael Dowling, Jody Lambert",2016,5.3,333,"[{'Value': '5.3/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '47%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '45/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",brave new jersey,,,,,,,,,

Regrettably, his “Armed Response,” a low-budget, high-tech action film with supernatural overtones, is devoid of such a sense of play.A former penitentiary now used for interrogating terrorists and war criminals has been attacked by an unknown force, and all its support personnel wiped out. Now a Special Forces squad leader (a musclebound but curiously muted Wesley Snipes) reunites his old crew to enter the compound and crack the mystery. Among his team members are a hothead (the wrestling superstar Seth Rollins); a meek software expert (Morgan Roberts); another computer wizard, with a troubled past (Dave Annable); and a squandered Anne Heche.Off they wander through the complex, with flashlights in dark corridors, checking cells and sensory-deprivation tanks, finding corpses and discovering that this antiseptic labyrinth — called the Temple — is itself a sentient entity with murder on its mind. As they discover the fate of the Temple’s previous occupants, they in turn are, of course, picked off one by one. The squad’s history in Afghanistan, and complicity in abuses there, plays a part.The possibilities are intriguing, but the characters are underdrawn, and the pacing lags. (Endless time is spent looking at monitors.) There is a “final girl” of sorts — in horror movies, the perennial remaining woman confronting the antagonist — but we hardly know her. Most egregiously, “Armed Response,” whose producers include Mr. Snipes and Gene Simmons of Kiss, offers underwhelming gunplay and fisticuffs.

As this public charter school geared up to graduate its first class last year, the filmmakers of “Step” were there to observe three seniors, all members of its step dance team.Cori, the valedictorian, is hoping to receive a “full ride” to Johns Hopkins University. She’s the oldest of six children, and while her home life is anchored by a loving and supportive mother and stepfather, money is always tight. That’s also the case for Blessin, a hair and makeup maven — she seems to have a different hair style in every other shot. Blessin has trouble maintaining her grades, however, and in getting her mother, who suffers from depression, from partaking fully in weighing her post-high-school options. Tayla also has wobbly grades, and her mother, a police officer, sometimes embarrasses her because of her enthusiasm for the step team.This documentary has a classic twinned narrative: The girls must get into college (that’s the school’s main goal), and there’s a big step competition coming up. “Step” manages to tell both stories in under 90 minutes, with a city rived by the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody as its fraught backdrop. The film uses such crowd-pleasing devices as scoring a “Rocky”-training-style montage to Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It.” The action in this sequence is mostly Cori, Blessin and Tayla filling out application forms on computers, but one has to work with what one has.In trying to deliver messages of inspiration and empowerment, the director, Amanda Lipitz, deliberately swerves around the delivery of a comprehensive narrative. (In one section Blessin misses a day of school because of, according to a family discussion, conflict with some girls on the step team, but this issue is never otherwise addressed.)The film’s success is directly dependent on the personalities — and achievements — of the young women highlighted. Despite the narrative gaps, Ms. Lipitz excels at putting across those personalities. Blessin, Cori, and Tayla make you smile, make you worry and make you root for them.On the other hand, the polished optimistic tenor of the movie arguably makes their triumphs seem like a foregone conclusion. Beyond the quibbles I might have, though, this is a highly pertinent story told in an entertaining way.","Gari McIntyre, Amanda Leonard, Blessin Giraldo, Chevonne Hall","$1,137,759",USA,Amanda Lipitz,Documentary,English,81,STEP documents the senior year of a girls' high-school step dance team against the background of inner-city Baltimore.,PG,N/A,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,84 min,Step,N/A,2017,6.8,640,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '96%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '81/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",step,Step,Fox Searchlight,3998.0,1.0,42.0,95.0,1081116.0,35.0,17416.0

Based — loosely seems altogether too generous a word — on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clichés that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shoot’em-up. About the only thing holding it together is Idris Elba, whose irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity anchors this mess but can’t redeem it.Mr. Elba plays the otherworldly Roland, whose name suggests the Arthurian legend with knights and so forth. Onscreen, though, Roland basically points, shoots and serves as an overqualified babysitter for Jake (Tom Taylor), a 14-year-old with psychic powers (he “shines” à la “The Shining”) who lives here and now on what Roland calls Keystone Earth. Roland, by contrast, lives in Mid-World, an incoherent realm of foggy woods, digital boogeymen, cinematic allusions, slavering nods to Mr. King’s voluminous oeuvre and some geological formations that may cause you to uselessly flash on images from John Ford westerns. (The movie was partly shot in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa.)For reasons that emerge in expository blurts, Jake and Roland travel between Mid-World and the considerably less interesting Keystone Earth. Also on the move is Walter, a.k.a. the man in black (Matthew McConaughey), an amusingly dissolute supervillain who, with weary hand waves and insinuating whispers, oozes about like a Vegas lounge lizard — with a hint of the Wicked Witch of the West snap – lording over heavily armed, face-changing, blood-lusting snarlers (Jackie Earle Haley, et. al). Mr. McConaughey, topped by an artfully arranged shock of black hair and flashing some tanned chest that makes you want to whip out the gold chains, has truly developed into a Zen master of sleaze.The title refers to a mysteriously woo-woo, sky-piercingly tall spire that somehow holds both the universe’s various worlds and its monstrous threats in check. Walter wants to destroy the dark tower; Roland intends to protect it. Jake, who tends to look as confused as the audience may feel, doesn’t yet have a mission, though giving this twerp a purpose — a kind of wee hero’s journey (“Surrender, Jake”!) — seems to be the endgame. It’s a default solution, and reads like a cop-out. After all, if Stephen King hands you a complex fiction that turns pulpy tropes into a dense mythology with its own language and heavyweight heroes like Roland, wouldn’t you run with at least some of it?The “Dark Tower” series can be traced to Mr. King’s love of, among other inspirations, J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” novels as well as Sergio Leone’s masterly 1966 film “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” which I suppose explains the duster Roland wears and an empty nod to spaghetti westerns. So, there’s that. Mostly, there are clotted action scenes, gun fetishism, bad writing and stop-and-go rhythms that suggest a longer version may once have existed. The director, Nikolaj Arcel, shares screenwriting credit and blame with Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner and Anders Thomas Jensen; whatever they thought they were doing here remains as mysterious as Walter’s hair product.","Matthew McConaughey, Idris Elba, Tom Taylor, Dennis Haysbert","$50,644,837",USA,Nikolaj Arcel,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",English,34,"The last Gunslinger: Roland Deschain, has been locked in an eternal battle with Walter O'Dim, also known as the Man in Black, and determined to prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower that holds the universe together.

It’s a little amazing how a story so guilty of gross-out violence can retain a share of comic innocence.That innocence begins and ends with Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler), whose batty girlfriend, Liza (AnnaLynne McCord), plans to rob her sugar daddy (David Maldonado) of the cash in his safe. The bumbling Chip is reluctant to help, but Liza is persuasive — she punches hard — and before you can say “They shouldn’t be bringing weapons to this supposedly nonviolent robbery,” everything hits the fan.Some twists and double-crosses follow the theft, none of them too complex or entirely logical. But this movie is determined not to take itself seriously, and that makes it easy for you to do the same and cackle, even as the bloodshed turns ridiculously foul and cheesiness is played as a virtue.Mr. Gubler and Ms. McCord’s characters are matched to maximum effect — he’s nervous, she’s violent — and Trent Haaga, the writer and director, races through scenes as if there were no time to waste, adding to the energy. Though his script is only half as clever as it should be, that’s enough to give the movie a daffy charm. Alisha Boe and Sheila Vand, in supporting roles, are by turns sexy and strange.We’ll be “in and out like it’s nothing — nobody gets hurt,” Liza tells Chip as she plans the crime. It’s a ludicrous moment — there should be a neon sign above her head blinking, “Fat Chance.” In that scene and others, however, you find yourself laughing out loud, and minutes later, covering your eyes.","Matthew Gray Gubler, AnnaLynne McCord, Alisha Boe, Sheila Vand",N/A,USA,Trent Haaga,"Comedy, Crime, Romance",English,56,"A punk-rock after hours about femininity, masculinity and the theft of $68,000.",R,Snowfort Pictures,"[{'Value': '6.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,93 min,68 Kill,"Trent Haaga (screenplay), Bryan Smith (novel)",2017,6,"2,793","[{'Value': '6.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '74%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '56/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",68 kill,,,,,,,,,

Karla panics during a call to her lawyer — her ex has a girlfriend and a business, and she’s only a waitress. But when Frankie is kidnapped while playing at a park, the meek Karla is unleashed as the vigilante Valkyrie of the Interstate highways, promising herself and Frankie’s backwoods abductors through car accidents and police interference: “As long as my son is in that car, I will not stop. Wherever you go, I will be right behind you.”It’s sometimes funny to watch Ms. Berry act out scenes of Karla’s frenzy — running at full speed with a limp, gingerly approaching a kidnapper’s lair with a gun she’s never used. But as a producer of the movie as well as its star, she approaches the task of playing this unhinged mother on the run with sincerity.The director, Luis Prieto, doesn’t waste time trying to build an arc to Karla’s desperation. Her adrenaline kicks in the moment she sees Frankie being shoved into the back seat of an unfamiliar Mustang, and it doesn’t dip until the credits roll. Cars crash, Karla rises. Guns fire, Karla slashes. The greatest strength of “Kidnap” is that it casts the maternal instinct as a primordial will to enact violence, to drag a man from a moving van, to beat a kidnapper with a shovel. We see Karla find her best weapons in blunt objects, and to its credit, “Kidnap” is a blunt movie.","Halle Berry, Sage Correa, Chris McGinn, Lew Temple","$30,597,319",USA,Luis Prieto,"Action, Crime, Drama",English,44,A mother stops at nothing to recover her kidnapped son.,R,Aviron Pictures,"[{'Value': '5.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,95 min,Kidnap,Knate Lee,2017,5.9,"26,300","[{'Value': '5.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '37%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '44/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",kidnap,Kidnap,Aviron Pictures,360.0,14.0,10.0,36.0,30718107.0,105.0,17486.0

This documentary takes us into the mind and body of a young Irish filmmaker, Simon Fitzmaurice, who wakes each morning closer to total paralysis.Speaking in the first person, the actor Colin Farrell narrates Mr. Fitzmaurice’s story as he struggles to pursue his career while losing his body to the neurodegenerative disease A.L.S., or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Frankie Fenton directed this film, which borrows from Mr. Fitzmaurice’s memoir of the same title and makes liberal use of boisterous and tender home videos of his family that also document the last time Mr. Fitzmaurice danced or walked.Perhaps the most striking aspect of the film is the shocking rapidity of his decline. Once his diagnosis becomes clear, when he is 34, doctors predict Mr. Fitzmaurice will live three to four years, but he soars past that (he is now 42) and remains amazingly productive, working painstakingly on his first feature film, “My Name Is Emily,” released this year.By the time shooting begins on that film, Mr. Fitzmaurice is using a ventilator to breathe. He directs the actors through his only means of communication: eye-gaze technology. His computer decodes his gaze and speaks for him in a robotic voice, which his wife charmingly refers to as “American.”He displays a powerful will to live, and he and his wife make the most of it so every day is memorable for the children, who number five by the film’s end.

The idea, a sort of “Super Size Me” with steroids instead of Big Macs, brought him into contact with Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who led Russia’s antidoping laboratory for Olympic athletes.Early scenes show Mr. Fogel injecting himself (needle-phobics, beware) with substances, then charting his performance as he meets with specialists and makes video calls with Dr. Rodchenkov.Months into the plan, Dr. Rodchenkov and Russia came under investigation for widespread doping at the Olympic Games. Mr. Fogel stops his own story and puts the focus entirely on Dr. Rodchenkov, who leaves Moscow for the United States. In interviews the doctor outlines Russia’s widespread steroid program and the clandestine steps taken to cover it up.Those revelations were first made public months before the 2016 Olympics, when Dr. Rodchenkov’s detailed confession about state-sponsored cheating at the 2014 Sochi Games appeared in The New York Times. In fleeing Moscow, Dr. Rodchenkov feared Russian reprisals, and the anxiety shown here is palpable; the doctor was eventually put into protective custody by the American government.Mr. Fogel could be considered either daring or foolhardy for his initial plan. But his work with Dr. Rodchenkov is levelheaded, and his documentary illuminating. There’s a lot not covered here — the ethical and moral questions of such drugs, their health effects and their use in professional sports are just a few. Those will have to wait for another film.

Jessica, arguing with a guy she’s sort of been seeing, delivers a kiss-off: “I’m freakin’ dope.” That bold declaration not only represents a strong young woman but is also a gift for fans of the actress who plays her, Jessica Williams, the former “Daily Show” correspondent and current co-host of the “2 Dope Queens” podcast.And yet the struggle is real for her character. Jessica James is a Brooklyn playwright going through a “weird transitional phase,” not really coping well with a recent breakup (her ex-boyfriend keeps coming to an untimely end in her dreams) and trying to remain optimistic as rejection letters from theater companies pile up. Those notices share a wall in her Bushwick apartment with Playbill covers, posters for old school productions and inspirational quotes from Lillian Hellman.Her love of theater is deep, as witnessed in scenes with young students in a playwriting class she teaches. She bonds with one, Shandra (a delightful Taliyah Whitaker), who shows promise but is also processing the recent divorce of her parents. The snappy dialogue makes Jessica’s silly moments with the kids as well as heart-to-hearts with her friend Tasha (Noël Wells, just as charming as she was in “Master of None”) feel most lived-in and natural, even when she is asked to recommend a show for a friend of her mother’s back home in Ohio who’s “heard good things about ‘Jersey Boys.’” Jessica prefers “dialogue-driven dramas that explore the human condition.”The director Jim Strouse wrote this movie, which began streaming Friday on Netflix, for Ms. Williams after she appeared in his 2015 film, “People Places Things.” The camera lovingly follows her on her adventures in the city, and it’s easy to see why he was inspired to give her this breakout role.Her character’s forthrightness draws in friends and intrigues potential suitors, including the recently divorced Boone (played by a scruffy and slightly goofy Chris O’Dowd). They are complete opposites but find themselves in bed after an awkward first date. Their courtship involves an elaborate plan to break free of the obsessive cycle of stalking their exes on social media. The solution: Each will follow the other’s ex.But this is Ms. Williams’s movie, and she owns it. (Though, with its strong ensemble — Lakeith Stanfield plays her ex — I kept thinking it could make for a smart series.) She’s a radiant, tall glass of dopeness and isn’t afraid to tell you so.

For sure, this funny and tender film prompts cheerful smiles, but sometimes they turn melancholy.Set in a Hasidic neighborhood in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the story finds the title character (played by Menashe Lustig) working in a small supermarket. He’s constantly berated by his boss and others, and their criticisms aren’t always without cause: Menashe is often late and prone to blunders, and is usually short of money.Outside of his job, he has a bigger worry: regaining custody of his son. Menashe is a widower, and his orthodox Jewish faith requires him to raise his child, Rieven (Ruben Niborski), in a home with a mother. A rabbi has decreed that until Menashe remarries, Rieven must live with an aunt and uncle. That same rabbi, however, has allowed father and son to spend a week together before Rieven returns to those relatives.Over the week, the two bond, argue and work, all of it shown with a naturalism that can be clumsy or graceful, but it always feels authentic. One mostly silent scene, showing them simply spending time with each other, is moving in its affection. Another scene, when Menashe is on a date arranged by a matchmaker, generates both winces and laughs.Joshua Z. Weinstein, the director, shot the film in Yiddish and often in secret in Hasidic neighborhoods. His images are unaffected and candid, with wordless close-ups that speak for themselves. Mr. Weinstein made documentaries before this, his first fiction feature, and it shows.The script, which he wrote with Alex Lipschultz and Musa Syeed, was inspired by Mr. Lustig’s experiences, and the actors are nonprofessionals whose performances ring true. Mr. Lustig is wonderfully empathetic, still more so when he’s paired with the splendid young Mr. Niborski.The film is worth praising for what it is and admiring for what it’s not — there’s no sappiness or false emotion, and none of the clichéd, quirky misfits who populate so many commercial comedies. (It’s a fine addition to several recent indie features, including “Man Push Cart” and “Stand Clear of the Closing Doors,” that examine pockets of overlooked city dwellers.) “Menashe” also gently raises a few questions about faith, change and conformity.Menashe himself is not always easy to like. He can be clever and friendly yet foolish and wrong: In other words, he’s awfully real. At times you’ll feel like shaking him in frustration for his actions. But minutes later, you’ll want to put an arm around this big man’s shoulder and, together with him, hope that things will be all right.","Menashe Lustig, Yoel Falkowitz, Hershy Fishman, Ruben Niborski","$1,688,620",USA,Joshua Z Weinstein,Drama,"Yiddish, English",81,"Within Brooklyn's ultra-orthodox Jewish community, a widower battles for custody of his son.

Gore) but still making the same arguments that have been hallmarks of his career.If there is a thesis in this new documentary, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (“Audrie & Daisy”), it’s that a rise in extreme weather is making the impact of climate change harder to deny. The movie touches on Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the wildfire in Fort McMurray, Canada, and the Zika virus. Mr. Gore visits Greenland and the flooded streets of the Miami area. (He acknowledges a complicated relationship with Florida.)“The dots are seldom connected in the media,” he says at one point, but events like these are symptoms of global warming.As positive developments, he notes the 2015 launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory satellite, and visits a small city in Texas whose Republican mayor has decided that renewable energy makes market sense.“An Inconvenient Sequel” delves deeper into the arcane details of compromise than its predecessor, with scenes of Mr. Gore working to find a middle ground between the needs of developed and developing nations. In a group meeting, Piyush Goyal, India’s power minister, pushes back against Mr. Gore’s desire to replicate in India the expanded use of solar energy in the United States. “I’ll do the same thing after 150 years,” Mr. Goyal replies.During the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, Mr. Gore, who wasn’t an official negotiator, tries to persuade Lyndon Rive, then chief executive of the American company SolarCity, to grant India the rights to a patent on a type of solar technology. (The results aren’t clear from the film; India signed on to the Paris agreement without making a deal with SolarCity and still hasn’t made one.)Mr. Gore likens President Trump’s election to a quip often attributed to Mike Tyson: You always have a plan until you get punched in the face. The movie has been updated since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January to include Mr. Trump’s announcement of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a decision that probably forecasts another sequel.","Al Gore, George W.

The new documentary “Water and Sugar: Carlo Di Palma, the Colours of Life” explores Di Palma’s long career, from that auspicious beginning to his work on “Red Desert,” “Radio Days” and some of the other best films of the 20th century.The director, Fariborz Kamkari, lingers on the golden touch that Di Palma, who died in 2004, brought to films with Michelangelo Antonioni, and he enlists collaborators like Woody Allen to explain Di Palma’s influence on their work. Though brief service is paid to this filmmaker’s personal life, viewers seeking a juicy backstage glimpse of his famous friends should look elsewhere. Under the careful eye of Mr. Kamkari and Di Palma’s widow, Adriana Chiesa, a producer on the movie, “Water and Sugar” presents an official history, focused more on work than pleasure or even personality.If the movie were reliant on only the rosy recollections of Di Palma’s professional connections, the man himself might slip out of view like the last light at dusk. Testimonials about his sensitivity pale in comparison with seeing scenes like Di Palma’s illuminated dance hall, empty but for one couple, who dance under the glow of a thousand lights in “Teresa the Thief.” As one memorable anecdote from the set of “Blow-Up” illustrates, he was a man to paint the grass if reality wasn’t green enough. In the end, “Water and Sugar” proves the best view of Di Palma is still the gaze from his own eyes.","Carlo Di Palma, Carlo Vanzina, Valentina Di Palma, Giuliano Montaldo",N/A,Italy,Fariborz Kamkari,Documentary,"Italian, English, Russian, French",65,"A look at the life and work of Italian cinematographer, Carlo di Palma.",N/A,N/A,"[{'Value': '8.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",28 Jul 2017,90 min,"Water and Sugar: Carlo Di Palma, the Colours of Life",N/A,2016,8,30,"[{'Value': '8.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '70%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '65/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]","water and sugar: carlo di palma, the colours of life",,,,,,,,,

She makes a moving argument.,"It’s easy to fall in love with the animals in “Sled Dogs.” It’s thornier to sift through the words of the handlers and mushers — many of whom seem to genuinely care for the dogs — and determine how pervasive abuse is in dog-sledding ventures.The filmmaker Fern Levitt says that her research began with no agenda but that as she saw more abuse, her film took shape, along with a desire to shut down the industry and find homes for the dogs. She makes a moving argument, introducing us to animals who start training as puppies and often end up tethered to a short chain — when they aren’t pulling tourists or racing. Sadder still are the cases of dogs who are killed when they are no longer useful, like the 100 animals shot by a recreational sledding company near Whistler, British Columbia.In Alaska, the 1,000-mile Iditarod, from Anchorage to Nome, is the pinnacle of the sport. According to lore, the inspiration for the race was an emergency run to deliver serum to Nome, which was on the brink of a diphtheria epidemic. But that was a relay, taking on fresh mushers and dogs periodically, whereas Iditarod racers use a single team.These dogs are portrayed as elite athletes, born to run, but the film points out that they are asked to, in effect, run a marathon day after day for the course of the Iditarod. There are disturbing scenes from the trail of dogs who cannot go farther and must be carried to the veterinarians at the next checkpoint.Ms. Levitt went on a sled ride once, and after a look behind the scenes, took a dog home with her.

But maybe that’s not entirely surprising for a movie loosely about authenticity and the little absurdities that abound in New York City.In expanding his 2014 short film, the writer and director Dustin Guy Defa re-enlisted his friend Bene Coopersmith, a Red Hook record shop owner with limited acting experience, for this low-budget indie feature unfolding over the course of a day and divided into several separate story lines. Mr. Coopersmith’s, though, is one of the more watchable and entertaining. He’s a real character. When he sets out to buy a rare Charlie Parker record, the camera, shooting in grainy 16 millimeter, follows him on a journey around Brooklyn, which includes a funny sequence involving a bike chase, and a recurring bit in which Mr. Coopersmith frets about his new shirt. (Is it too sharp?)Among the other ensemble members are Michael Cera, as a reporter desperate to connect, and Abbi Jacobson, as an awkward newbie reporter, afraid of failure; Tavi Gevinson, who plays an angsty teenager questioning her sexuality and other weighty issues; a spot-on Philip Baker Hall, as a withdrawn watchmaker who may hold the key to a mysterious death; and George Sample III, convincing as an anguished man facing the consequences of an act of vengeance.While Mr. Defa’s dialogue mostly flows naturally from Mr. Coopersmith, it can seem too self-aware and precious in the other characters’ mouths. And the soundtrack — an infectious blend of retro gospel, R&B and funk — often feels too breezy and soulful for this mundane affair, especially when it precedes scenes with pouty teenagers, even if they’re world-weary sorts.","Abbi Jacobson, Michael Cera, Tavi Gevinson, Bene Coopersmith","&pound;48,347",USA,Dustin Guy Defa,"Comedy, Drama",English,53,Follows a variety of New York characters as they navigate personal relationships and unexpected problems over the course of one day.,NOT RATED,Magnolia Pictures,"[{'Value': '5.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",28 Jul 2017,84 min,Person to Person,Dustin Guy Defa,2017,5.7,"1,127","[{'Value': '5.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '51%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '53/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",person to person,,,,,,,,,

He has shown commendable stalwartness in walking the walk, so to speak, not just starting a foundation to help victims of Haiti’s 2010 earthquake but traveling there to help on the ground. We can read Mr. Penn’s latest directorial effort, “The Last Face,” as a kind of tribute to the aid workers he has met. As well meaning as this movie is, it is also a turgid, muddled one.“The Last Face” uses crises in the war-torn regions of Liberia and South Sudan to frame a knotty love story between Charlize Theron’s Wren, the daughter of a founder of an organization like Doctors Without Borders, and Javier Bardem’s Miguel, a dedicated surgeon. At one point Ms. Theron’s character asks, in voice-over, “In this place of so much war, had I found peace?” The script, by Erin Dignam, doesn’t get much deeper than that. The romantic chemistry between Ms. Theron and Mr. Bardem feels forced throughout, never more so than in a scene of mutual seduction in a cutesy context of brushing teeth. Mr. Penn is more than competent in recreating the noise, gore and panic of war zones, but far less so in simulating the atmosphere of alienated romance common in 1960s European art films.And then there’s the unusual text in the movie’s opening credits: “Vocal Artists: Eddie Vedder, Mary J. Blige, Suki Waterhouse.” It appears while a simple and haunting song of African provenance plays. More than two hours later, the end credits inform you that the song is “Makambo,” by the Ugandan musician Geoffrey Oryema.

A collection of moments rather than a linear story, this film is at its best when it’s suffused with the presence of the Dalai Lama, whether he is watching schoolchildren in Canada practice gratitude or meditating on separating his consciousness from his body in preparation for death.One fascinating segment introduces the Atlas of Emotions, commissioned by the Dalai Lama and developed by Paul and Eve Ekman, a father and daughter who used behavioral science to map human feelings and their consequences.Another shows Philip Glass at the organ at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York, playing music he composed for the Dalai Lama’s 1979 visit there and discussing how his own practice of Buddhism helped him as a composer.No film about this holy man would be complete without a recap of the escape from Tibet to Dharamsala, India, after the Chinese takeover of the country. The movie notes that the Chinese government has declared it will control the selection and development of the next Dalai Lama, an absurd idea to those who believe succession is a matter of reincarnation. The specter of two competing lamas, one controlled by the Chinese, also arises.

(As a former Chicagoan, I’ll confess to some affection for the location, around the corner from the city’s main screening room for movie critics.)There, Cassidy (Virginia Kull), an aspiring actress with no real prospects, takes a job as a courier for Barry (Ed Begley Jr.), a diamond importer who is seeing Cassidy’s mother (Marilu Henner). The job requires Cassidy to carry diamonds to nearby stores. The theory is that security firms get robbed; an ordinary woman on the street will not. And if she does get robbed, Alex (Ashton Holmes), Barry’s son, tells her, the business has insurance. Since they are both broke, the temptations are obvious.Mr. Singer, who wrote, directed and scored the film, mines a fair amount of comedy from Cassidy’s attempts to recruit an accomplice, Ray (Zach McGowan), her ex and a former drug dealer who, unfortunately for her and Alex, has embarked on a period of self-improvement.The characters’ musings about regrets — life is imperfect, you see — seem superfluous, the byproducts of an overwritten screenplay. Most of the movie’s pleasures come from Ms. Kull, a better actress than the one she plays, and the convolutions of the plot, which has a few good feints and dodges.","Zach McGowan, Marilu Henner, Ed Begley Jr., Virginia Kull",N/A,USA,David Singer,"Comedy, Crime, Mystery, Thriller",English,45,"Cassidy is a struggling actress, grinding out auditions, worrying that any chance at stardom may have already passed her by.

Darcy is at a crossroads: Applying for a belated bachelor’s degree, she may soon lose her job to budget cuts. Her son, Walker, committed suicide seven years earlier.Darcy soon learns that Mark (Shane Jacobsen), a friend of Walker’s, has grown wealthy after founding a chain of hot dog restaurants — Walker’s idea. Conspiring to confront Mark in New Orleans, she brings along her friend Byrd (Carrie Coon) and the gun Walker used to kill himself, probably more for symbolism than for proving Chekhov’s axiom.The journey is a pretext for healing, as Darcy visits an old friend (Glenne Headly, who died in June) and Walker’s father (Ted Ferguson), who abused her but is now ailing and mute. This gives Darcy a chance to unburden her thoughts to him while allowing Ms. Dieckmann, who wrote the screenplay, to avoid the complications of constructing a conversation.That’s the movie in a nutshell: A catharsis more meaningful for the character than for her audience.","Holly Hunter, Carrie Coon, Kim Coates, Choppy Guillotte",N/A,USA,Katherine Dieckmann,"Adventure, Drama",English,57,"A poignant, lyrical drama about a mother (Hunter), who, in an effort to deal with the grief over the death of her son, travels the back roads of the deep south to settle a score.

Conventionally beautiful, that is. “I Dream in Another Language” features lush tropical landscapes and attractive, compelling people, always lit — not quite just so (the filmmakers clearly know better) — with exemplary attention to the most eye-catching detail. It’s delectably watchable.Directed by Ernesto Contreras from a script by his brother Carlos, the movie opens as a young linguist, Martín (Fernando Álvarez Rebeil), enters a remote Mexican hamlet to record the last speakers of a dying language. As it happens, they are two old men who have been enemies for 50 years.One, Isauro (José Manuel Poncelis), is a hermit who speaks only the dying language. The other, Evaristo (Eligio Meléndez), is a well-respected village elder who also speaks Spanish. Their falling-out decades before involved the woman Evaristo married. That woman is long dead, but Evaristo has an attractive granddaughter, Lluvia (Fátima Molina), of whom, he says to Martín, “You lay a hand on her, I’ll kill you.” In the next scene, Martín and Lluvia are shown together in bed.So “I Dream in Another Language” is that kind of movie, too. The story is not without interest, and it touches on a couple of worthwhile themes: cultural erasure and the way religious and provincial prejudices can suppress love. But its treatment of these subjects is perhaps undercut by its conventionality, which even extends to the movie’s left turn into a kind of magic realism late in the story.","Fernando Álvarez Rebeil, José Manuel Poncelis, Eligio Meléndez, Fátima Molina",N/A,"Mexico, Netherlands",Ernesto Contreras,"Drama, Romance","Spanish, English",64,"When a language dies, a unique vision of the world is lost forever.",UNRATED,N/A,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",28 Jul 2017,103 min,I Dream in Another Language,Carlos Contreras,2017,7.5,994,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '64/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",i dream in another language,,,,,,,,,

Few viewers are likely to make it that far, so let’s start where many will stop: the English-language title, whose meaning is never clarified.Instead of a land of the moon, Nicole Garcia’s mostly turgid, occasionally risible period piece, largely set in the 1950s, initially takes us to Lyon, France. Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard) spots a familiar address on a building that prompts flashbacks to a lost love.In her youth, she chases after a teacher with an almost feral abandon, privately licking his copy of “Wuthering Heights.” It’s not clear whether she’s mad, as some think, or whether her longings result from a repressive upbringing. The movie barely seems to decide.Gabrielle’s mother (Brigitte Roüan) arranges for her to marry a Catalan laborer (Alex Brendemühl), who is bizarrely nonchalant about the deal. (At Gabrielle’s request, he agrees never to have sex with her.)But when Gabrielle receives a diagnosis of kidney stones — the subtitles translate the French term “mal de pierres” as “stones sickness” — she travels to the Alps. There, the film offers “A Cure for Wellness” unexpected competition for the most ludicrous 2017 release set in a Swiss spa.Ms. Cotillard can be magnetic even when playing an unplayable character, but when Gabrielle falls for a veteran (Louis Garrel, who has perfected the facial expression of someone looking for another conversation), the chasm between her abilities and her co-star’s is mountainous.","Marion Cotillard, Alex Brendemühl, Louis Garrel, Brigitte Roüan","$45,457","France, Belgium, Canada",Nicole Garcia,"Drama, Romance","French, Spanish, German",40,"In 1950s France, Gabrielle is a passionate, free-spirited woman who is in a loveless marriage and falls for another man when she is sent away to the Alps to treat her kidney stones.

One item considered particularly risible in certain corners was a pitch to the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment from a sort of youth consultant, averring that “NBD,” shorthand for no big deal, was popular text speak among millennials and that it should be used as dialogue in a new “Spider-Man” movie.Sony’s latest release, “The Emoji Movie,” features among its heroes a female computer hacker who at one point shrugs off a crisis by saying “NBD.” I’m not sure if this is an indication of abject cluelessness, or if it represents what I believe some millennials call a self-own.This film is exactly what its posters would lead you to believe it is: an animated narrative film about emoji. It tells the story of Gene (voiced by T. J. Miller), who is a “meh” emoji but who is capable of making more expressions than the blasé one he has been assigned. His versatility is considered a malfunction, even, to some extent, by Gene himself. This leads the effusively smiling leader of the emoji to lobby for Gene’s deletion from the phone on which he lives.The rationalization this movie uses for the anthropomorphization of the emoji is weak, to put it mildly. But once that has been taken care of, Gene goes on his hero’s quest in search of the cloud, where he seeks to be reprogrammed so he can do the job he takes so much pride in. He of course has a bumbling sidekick (a high-five emoji) in tow. They enlist the help of the hacker Jailbreak and move through the corridors of their phone. Much labored app humor follows.For a long time, Hollywood has been propagating the idea that the panderingly, trendily idiotic can be made to seem less so, by polishing it up with bright shiny gloss and enlisting engaging talented performers and writers. I can’t be entirely certain of this, but I would say “The Emoji Movie” takes this notion to the outer limits of credibility. The voice cast is full of name actors, some of whom have genuine appeal. One of the screenwriters is the very astute Mike White. This movie’s “believe in yourself” message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic. To add to the pain and despair of the experience, “The Emoji Movie” is preceded by a short, “Puppy,” featuring the characters from the “Hotel Transylvania” animated movies. It is also idiotic.","T.J.

It already is one, in a manner of speaking, given that its strengths are lavishly violent, inventively choreographed fights that have been glued together by nonsense and Charlize Theron. The nonsense involves spies chasing secrets in Berlin just before the fall of the wall, which may suggest John le Carré but plays closer to a dumb and dumber take on Boris and Natasha. Mostly, the movie is an excuse to watch a beautiful, deviously clever female avatar as she is stripped naked, dolled up and repeatedly beaten down only to rise again.This sort of spectacle — dress her up, dress her down, smack her around and wait for payback — isn’t new, even if moviemakers like to insist otherwise. What’s moderately different here is the sexed-up packaging of the violence in combination with Ms. Theron, who plays Lorraine Broughton, a spy in Her Majesty’s Secret Service with a blond bob and a fondness for lethal heels. Like James Bond, Lorraine shoots to kill while remaining fabulously dressed to kill. This means she gets slammed around a lot, and takes almost as much punishment as she metes out. She’s a punching bag, but she’s also a fantasist’s dream girl: the avenging goddess, destroyer of men.Lorraine gets plenty of opportunities to mix it up in Berlin, where the story soon turns into spy versus spy with washes of lurid color, topsy-turvy camerawork, loads of crashing cars and wall-to-wall pounding tunes. The airborne cars pirouette prettily, bashing and smashing with all the technological expertise production money can buy; the symphony of body blows, gun pops and crunching metal sounds fine and convincing. The tunes (“99 Luftballons”) basically just goose the violence and beg for laughs, having been chosen to elicit knowing smiles of recognition. At one point, James McAvoy sidles into the story looking all cool or something and wearing a smirk he needs to employ more cautiously.For her part, Ms. Theron looks hot and color coordinated, with black-and-white outfits that suit her character’s ambiguity. Lorraine smokes and drinks and likes cold baths, preferably filled with ice cubes that do wonders for bruises and nipples. When she isn’t moodily bathing or staring — into a mirror, the distance, what have you — she does a surprising amount of walking. She goes here, promenades there, strolling down halls and mean streets that the director David Leitch turns into fashion runways. She doesn’t slip into rooms, she cat-walks, making entrances as if looking for trouble or paparazzi; it’s no wonder someone says she isn’t well disguised. Ms. Theron really is ready to play Bond.Written by Kurt Johnstad, “Atomic Blonde” is based on “The Coldest City,” a darkly shadowed, minimalist graphic novel written by Antony Johnston and illustrated by Sam Hart. As in the novel, the movie continually shifts between Berlin, where all the action happens, and an interrogation room in which Lorraine is being drilled by some intelligence types (John Goodman, Toby Jones). On the page, this bifurcation works, but on the screen it saps the story’s momentum, partly because there’s no violence in the room to distract from the genericism and puerility of the dialogue. At least in Berlin there are streets, beats and the sight of restlessly moving, twisting, slamming bodies.As she does, Ms. Theron locks down your attention immediately, holding you with her beauty and quiet vigilance. (She lets you see that she knows you’re watching her.) Plenty of pretty people slide right off the screen. Ms. Theron, by contrast, holds you partly because she doesn’t seem eager to let you in, keeping you curious as she keeps you at bay with reserve and sphinxlike smiles. This distance adds to her mystery and it also makes the eruptions of violence more electric. As “Mad Max: Fury Road” confirmed, she’s a natural warrior, but it’s interesting here that each exertion and exhalation, each meaty, pulpy thump, also seems to be battering the fortifications that she has built around her.Mr. Leitch was one of the directors on “John Wick,” a model of economic genre filmmaking, and he gives this movie’s action scenes the same pummeling, visceral quality. Lorraine punches and is punched, and her body is soon mapped by bruises and abrasions. It’s a lot of abuse for such puny returns, even if the fights are the best parts of “Atomic Blonde.” Mr. Leitch understands the expressivity of hand-to-hand fights and he frames them accordingly, pushing in when it counts and pulling back to show entire bodies in whirling motion. The closeness underscores the intimacy of battle while the distance underlines the performative aspect, allowing you to see both the choreography and the violent beauty moving forward and backward one bloody step at a time.","Charlize Theron, James McAvoy, Eddie Marsan, John Goodman","$51,536,935","Germany, Sweden, USA",David Leitch,"Action, Mystery, Thriller","English, German, Russian, Swedish",63,An undercover MI6 agent is sent to Berlin during the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents.,R,Focus Features,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",28 Jul 2017,115 min,Atomic Blonde,"Kurt Johnstad (screenplay by), Antony Johnston (based on the Oni Press graphic novel series ""The Coldest City"" written by), Sam Hart (based on the Oni Press graphic novel series ""The Coldest City"" illustrated by)",2017,6.7,"135,455","[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '78%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '63/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",atomic blonde,Atomic Blonde,Focus Features,8520.0,-14.0,153.0,56.0,51573925.0,63.0,17437.0
239,A.O. SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Detroit,"Review: In ‘Detroit,’ Black Lives Caught in a Prehistory of the Alt-Right",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/movies/detroit-review.html,2017-08-04,2017-07-26,"Kathryn Bigelow’s new movie, set amid the Detroit riots of 1967, grapples with the legacy of American racism.","Racial slurs fly fast and furious in Kathryn Bigelow’s “Detroit,” but the most troubling and divisive words uttered onscreen are variations on the simple pronouns “they” and “them.” The words may be perfectly neutral in themselves, but when used to separate one group of people from another they take on an insidious, implicitly violent connotation.“Detroit” is set mainly during the rioting that convulsed that city in the summer of 1967, and in it “them” is most often used — along with cognates like “those people” and “you people” — by white soldiers and police officers to refer to African-American citizens. (Nearly every white character with a speaking role wears a uniform of some kind.) Occasionally things go in the other direction, with “they” referring to the white authorities, but the reversal doesn’t indicate any kind of symmetry.The movie, which paints a sometimes muddled picture of a chaotic and contested moment in history, is admirably clear in this regard. It understands and strives to dramatize racism not as a matter of bad personal attitudes or equal and opposite prejudices, but rather as a structuring fact of American life, an apparatus of power, exclusion and control wielded against “them.”Ms. Bigelow and Mark Boal, the screenwriter (who collaborated with her on “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty”), train their focus on two aspects of the Detroit story: the day-to-day texture of working-class black life and the operations of white supremacy in conditions of emergency. Balancing those concerns is no easy task, and the filmmakers don’t take an easy route through their material. “Detroit,” like its namesake city, is populous and contradictory, with dozens of significant characters competing for attention as richly detailed scenes swell in crescendos of desperate suspense and sickening brutality.At moments (the quietest as well as some of the most intense), you feel in tune with both the fine grain of experience and the larger sweep of history. The specific, close-up acts of cruelty you witness are comprehensible as manifestations of a systemic, continuing and frequently invisible pattern of injustice. The film’s struggle against simplification — against the sentimentality, wishful thinking and outright denial that defines most Hollywood considerations of America’s racial past — is palpable, almost heroic, even if it is not always successful.Early scenes — following a gorgeous animated prologue that uses Jacob Lawrence paintings to evoke the decades of job discrimination, residential segregation and heavy-handed law enforcement that preceded the 1967 riots in Detroit and other Northern cities — zero in on the rebellion’s immediate cause: a late-night police raid on an unlicensed saloon.The opening 20 minutes register Ms. Bigelow’s virtuosity as a choreographer of chaos. She illuminates volatile and unpredictable circumstances with amazing poise and precision, producing an intuitive understanding of events that quickly spiral beyond the control or comprehension of their participants. Her combination of efficiency and expressiveness is matched by the actors — a formidable, mostly youthful ensemble including John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith and Jason Mitchell — even though the script at times inhibits their range, locking them into simple stances of aggression and fear.Amid the fire and looting and the audio and video clips of the Michigan governor George W. Romney and President Lyndon B. Johnson, a narrower plot takes shape, a real-life horror movie folded into a baggier film that feels, by turns, like a combat picture, a cavalry western, a police procedural and a courtroom drama.The fates of a collection of black and white Detroiters (as well as two unlucky visitors from Ohio) converge at a motel on the west side of the city. Two friends, Fred (Jacob Latimore) and Larry (Mr. Smith), are looking for a little fun after a disappointing evening at the Fox Theater downtown. They flirt with Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) and Julie (Hannah Murray), two white women, and join a makeshift party in a room belonging to Carl Cooper (Mr. Mitchell).Down the hall is Greene (Anthony Mackie), a soldier just back from Vietnam. A few blocks away, Melvin Dismukes (Mr. Boyega), a black security guard protecting a grocery store, brings coffee to a group of National Guardsmen, a gesture of diplomacy as well as self-protection. “I don’t want those boys shooting at us,” he tells his co-worker. Meanwhile, three patrolmen cruise the city. One of them, Krauss (Mr. Poulter), is still on the job after fatally shooting an unarmed looting suspect in the back.The nightmare that brought them all together is remembered as the Algiers Motel incident. It’s a notably ugly chapter in the annals of late-60s urban violence, and one that has an especially grim resonance in our own time. Three black men were shot to death — nine other people were terrorized and beaten — after the police and guardsmen arrived at the motel, responding to reports of sniper fire.Real events depicted in movies can’t exactly be given away, and this episode, while not as notorious as some other race-related murders of its era, isn’t all that obscure. (It is the subject of a book by John Hersey, a writer for The New Yorker, published a year after the riots and reissued in 1997 with an informative introduction by the historian Thomas J. Sugrue.) The basic arc of the story — the killing of unarmed black men, the spasm of outrage, the impunity ultimately bestowed on the perpetrators — is always shocking and rarely surprising. I’m sorry if that’s a spoiler.What matters more to Ms. Bigelow and Mr. Boal than plot twists or surprises — and to an audience torn between the urge to lean in and the desire to look away — is the minute-by-minute unspooling of accident, error and intentional evil that produced a tragic result. The important thing is not the literal accuracy of the overall account (though Mr. Boal, a former journalist, has been diligent in his research) but its plausibility. Is this what could have happened? Does it feel true?The answers, of course, can hardly be objective. The language of cinematic action — which Ms. Bigelow speaks as fluently and inventively as any living American director — is an idiom of feeling and visceral response. There are parts of “Detroit” that have a raw, unsettled authenticity, and others that sink in a welter of screaming and cursing.The Algiers becomes a trap, not only for the characters, who are stuck inside at the mercy of a maniac, but for the film itself, which loses its political and psychological coherence as the night drags on. Krauss, with his disconcertingly boyish looks and his sophomoric attempts to seem thoughtful, is a callow sociopath. His fellow officers Flynn (Ben O’Toole) and Demens (Jack Reynor) contribute sexual hysteria (when they see white women in the company of black men) and sheer idiocy. They are terrifying and contemptible — dismayingly believable figures from the prehistory of what is now called the alt-right.But as their villainy comes into relief, the humanity of their hostages begins to blur. In a horror movie, the monster is inevitably the center of interest, and once the first body in the motel falls, “Detroit” begins to trade its vivid sense of nuance — especially present in its delicate observation of Fred and Larry’s friendship — for bluntness and sensationalism. A complex, dreadful piece of history becomes an undialectical ordeal of viciousness and victimhood.The film opens with the assertion that in Detroit and elsewhere in the mid-1960s, “change had to come” and “the question was when and how.” But the promise implied in that “how” is one that “Detroit,” for all its impressive craft and unimpeachable intention, proves unable to fulfill. It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion — however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been — should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency.The filmmakers seem aware of this problem. They try toward the end to give the movie back, in effect, to its African-American characters, to refuse to let racism have the final word and to free themselves of storytelling conventions that insist on comfort and consensus. It doesn’t quite work. American movies have a hard time with division and with real-world problems that have yet to be solved. American politics does, too. The great virtue of “Detroit” is that it recognizes this difficulty. The failure to overcome it is hardly the film’s alone.","Chris Chalk, Mason Alban, Bennett Deady, Andrea Eversley","$16,788,494",USA,Kathryn Bigelow,"Crime, Drama, History",English,77,Fact-based drama set during the 1967 Detroit riots in which a group of rogue police officers respond to a complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds.,R,Annapurna Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",04 Aug 2017,143 min,Detroit,Mark Boal,2017,7.4,"35,516","[{'Value': '7.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '84%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '77/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",detroit,Detroit,Annapurna Pictures,643.0,112.0,11.0,58.0,16790139.0,77.0,17451.0

Near the end of one episode, the two women debate which murderer is the hottest. Soon they go to a prison to visit a convict (Annette O’Toole, a hoot), and along the way argue over their breakup.“You trick people with your boyishness,” Jean says.“I can’t help it I can lift semi-heavy things,” Morgan replies.Later, at a food co-op, Morgan meets Simone (Sheila Vand), a mysterious beauty. They begin a romance that borders on the strange, then grows downright eerie when Jean begins to suspect that Simone is a serial killer. Before some enticing evidence surfaces, Morgan is skeptical, and wonders if Jean may just be jealous.“I’d rather be with somebody that scares me to death than somebody that bores me to death,” Morgan says in a dig at her ex, who replies: “Go ahead, move in with her and get married and have a family that she can stab in the middle of the night.”Those lines and dozens of others are made sharper by the cast members, whose expressions are locked into permanent poker faces. Ms. Jungermann, who also wrote and directed this, her first feature, knows how to devise fast-moving and clever conversations. She’s even better at tacking a silence onto the end of a line, where it can prompt you to snort when you’re done laughing.As the movie enters its second half, however, some of that repetitive wryness can lead to slow sections as the is-she-or-isn’t-she-a-killer plot runs on, reaching for noir while relegating the wit to secondary status. Shannon Patricia O’Neill, as Alex, a foul-mouthed friend, and Grace Rex, as Kim, her fiancée, add energy, but a bit more physical comedy would be welcome.Still, working with what was surely a minuscule budget, Ms. Jungermann supplies an awful lot of humor — some of it light, the best of it dark — in “Women Who Kill.” Afterward, you may be compelled to go out for a drink, not just to discuss the story’s peculiar ending, but also because this film’s dryness leaves you feeling parched, in a very satisfying way.","Rachel Feinstein, Marina Franklin, Nikki Glaser, Amy Schumer",N/A,USA,Manny Rodriguez,Comedy,English,N/A,"Top comediennes Amy Schumer, Rachel Feinstein, Nikki Glaser and Marina Franklin join up in New York City for one hilarious night of stand-up comedy.",NOT RATED,eOne Entertainment Distribution,"[{'Value': '5.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",07 Mar 2013,59 min,Women Who Kill,N/A,2013,5.4,697,"[{'Value': '5.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",women who kill,,,,,,,,,

What at first seems like a thin topic — quick, name two American Indian musicians — becomes a master class in the mixing of cultures.The survey starts with the guitarist Link Wray, who was Shawnee. Wray “made an indelible mark on the whole evolution of where rock ’n’ roll was going to go,” Robbie Robertson of the Band says. Wray’s 1958 single, “Rumble,” was banned from airplay in several cities amid worries that it would incite teenage gang violence (despite being a wordless, instrumental tune), and Wray’s guitar line seems to echo in every power chord you’ve heard.Charley Patton, who profoundly shaped the blues, is profiled in another section before the film moves to Mildred Bailey, Jesse Ed Davis, members of the band Redbone and others, all of whom had Indian heritage. We hear about childhoods spent listening and learning from grandparents who passed on traditions, and of discrimination encountered in the broader world. “Be proud you’re an Indian, but be careful who you tell,” Mr. Robertson, who is part Mohawk, says of a prevailing attitude when he was younger.Shorter sections explore American Indian rhythms and beats that seeped into popular music, and the deep connections the players forged with African-American performers. Newsreels and old black-and-white photos provide historical context, and interviews add plenty of energy. Martin Scorsese and Iggy Pop offer insights, while Steven Van Zandt’s enthusiasm is contagious. After hearing a story by Jackson Browne, you’ll listen to his “Doctor My Eyes” with different ears.Directed by Catherine Bainbridge, “Rumble” takes a few serious turns even as it remains lively throughout. If you couldn’t name two Native American musicians at the beginning of the documentary, you’ll remember at least a half-dozen after the end. And it’s a good bet you’ll be searching for their albums, too.","Mildred Bailey, Randy Castillo, George Clinton, Pura Fe","&pound;222,370",Canada,"Catherine Bainbridge, Alfonso Maiorana(co-director)","Documentary, Music",English,73,RUMBLE: The Indians Who Rocked the World is a feature documentary about the role of Native Americans in popular music history.,N/A,Rezolution Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",26 Jul 2017,103 min,Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked The World,"Catherine Bainbridge, Alfonso Maiorana",2017,7.9,277,"[{'Value': '7.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '90%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '73/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",rumble: the indians who rocked the world,,,,,,,,,

This is an unusual formula but not an entirely novel one. While other examples of this method, or some variant of it, have yielded films that come off as condescending or creepily exploitative, Ms. Covi and Mr. Frimmel’s “Mister Universo” is a disarming and humane picture, an unexpected delight.Tairo Caroli is a young man who’s an animal tamer at a down-at-the-heels circus touring the outskirts of Rome. One of his big cats, Rambo, has just died; a couple of the others are indisposed. He’s a bit of a knucklehead, picking little fights with colleagues, and one of these battles escalates. Tairo’s good luck charm, a piece of iron that the 1957 Mister Universe and circus strongman Arthur Robin bent for Tairo when he was a boy, gets lost or stolen in an ensuing scrape. Downhearted and scared, Tairo takes to the road in search of Mr. Robin while Wendy, the circus’s contortionist, seeks a variety of mild occult solutions to Tairo’s seeming streak of bad luck.On his trip, shot in a documentary style that manages to generate real suspense, he catches up with friends and family, mostly circus folk too. One of them is caring for an aging chimpanzee named Lola, a showbiz vet who has a central role in Dario Argento’s 1985 horror thriller “Phenomena.” Like Tairo, the animal represents a way of life that’s going out with the tide of the postmodern.

243,MANOHLA DARGIS,1,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Dunkirk,"Review: ‘Dunkirk’ Is a Tour de Force War Movie, Both Sweeping and Intimate",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/dunkirk-review-christopher-nolan.html,2017-07-21,2017-07-20,"In his brilliant new film, Christopher Nolan revisits a harrowing, true World War II mission in a story of struggle, survival and resistance.","One of the most indelible images in “Dunkirk,” Christopher Nolan’s brilliant new film, is of a British plane in flames. The movie recounts an early, harrowing campaign in World War II that took place months after Germany invaded Poland and weeks after Hitler’s forces started rolling into the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. The plane, having glided to a stop, has been defiantly set ablaze by the pilot to avoid its being captured. It’s an image of unambiguous defeat but also an emblem of resistance and a portent of the ghastly conflagrations still to come.It’s a characteristically complex and condensed vision of war in a movie that is insistently humanizing despite its monumentality, a balance that is as much a political choice as an aesthetic one. And “Dunkirk” is big — in subject, reach, emotion and image. Mr. Nolan shot and mostly finished it on large-format film (unusual in our digital era), which allows details to emerge in great scale. Overhead shots of soldiers scattered across a beach convey an unnerving isolation — as if these were the last souls on earth, terminally alone, deserted. (Seen on a television, they would look like ants.) Film also enriches the texture of the image; it draws you to it, which is crucial given the minimalist dialogue.The movie is based on a campaign that began in late May 1940 in the French port city of Dunkirk, where some 400,000 Allied soldiers — including more than 200,000 members of the British Expeditionary Force, the British army in Western Europe — were penned in by the Germans. The British, faced with the capture or possible annihilation of their troops, initiated a seemingly impossible rescue. Named Operation Dynamo, this mission has assumed near-mythic status in British history and been revisited in books and onscreen; it shows up in “Mrs. Miniver,” a 1942 Hollywood weepie about British pain and perseverance in the war meant to encourage American support for the Allies.War movies tend to play out along familiar lines, including lump-in-the throat home-front tales like “Mrs. Miniver.” “Dunkirk” takes place in battle, but it, too, is a story of suffering and survival. Mr. Nolan largely avoids the bigger historical picture (among other things, the reason these men are fighting is a given) as well as the strategizing on the front and in London, where the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, was facing the horrifying possibility of diminished military muscle. Churchill is heard from, in a fashion, but never seen. Mr. Nolan instead narrows in on a handful of men who are scrambling and white-knuckling their way into history on the sea, in the air and on the ground.By turns intimate and sweeping, the film opens with six soldiers walking away from the camera down a spookily deserted street. Their bodies are shown in full, head to toe, and they are flanked by low buildings, the sort that now look so charming in touristic photographs. Slips of paper swirl around the men like autumn leaves. A few grab at the papers. One tries slurping water from a nearby garden hose; another pokes a hand through an open window, searching for a smoke. Still another reads one of the papers, which shows a map of the surrounding area encircled by arrows and ominous words of warning in English. He then crumples it, unbuckles his belt and begins to squat.It’s a somewhat perplexing, awkwardly funny moment — this is a manifestly serious situation, and you’re about to watch a man defecate. You don’t know whether to laugh, but before you decide, shots ring out and the soldiers start running, the camera quickly following. The haunted emptiness is suddenly filled with the sounds of frantic escape and whizzing bullets. And then the men begin falling, one, two, three, until just the unbuckling one remains, scrambling first over a gate and soon onto a beach where thousands of other soldiers are massed and waiting. He silently takes in the extraordinary scene and then hustles over to a dune to begin undoing his belt again.Scarcely a word has been uttered up to this point, yet much has been expressed: isolation; danger; desperation; fear; relief; and sheer, extreme bodily need and effort. Throughout this de facto prologue, Mr. Nolan emphasizes the concrete details, making you acutely aware of the fine-grained textures — the sores and embedded dirt on a man’s hands — and every resonant sound: the dribbling of water, the fluttering of paper, and the sharp crack and mechanical buzzing of rifle fire that turns into muffled thuds when bullets enter bodies. By the time the surviving soldier reaches the beach, you are already closely acquainted with his heavy breathing, wild fumbling and clumsy, chaotic running.Soon, the scene switches to another port, where a British teenager, George (Barry Keoghan), is helping a father and son (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney) unload a small yacht that’s been requisitioned for the Dunkirk mission. The three men instead set sail on their own, joining a civilian fleet — a rousing, motley armada of tugs, steamers, ferries and so on — that’s racing across the Channel. A third, astounding narrative section soon opens in the air, where three British Spitfire planes are quickly engaged in battle against German planes headed for Dunkirk, racing through the vast canopy and bobbing under clouds as the sun flashes, temporarily blinding them.Mr. Nolan’s elastic approach to narrative works beautifully in “Dunkirk,” which oscillates among its three sections, each largely taking place in distinct locations in different time frames. The events on the beach — called the Mole for the breakwater that’s used as a dock — unfold during one week. The events on the sea occur in one day, while the air scenes transpire in an hour. The locations and the time periods are announced onscreen. At first the dividing lines aren’t always obvious as Mr. Nolan cuts from daytime scenes on the ground to those in the sea and in the air, a slight merging of space and especially of time that underlines the enormity of a fight seemingly without end.Once Mr. Nolan begins switching between day and night, the lines dividing the three narrative segments mostly sharpen. Even as each section — with its individual dramas and perils — comes closer into view, Mr. Nolan keeps them all in dynamic play with one another. Some of this he achieves with stark visual echoes, as when water rushing into a downed Spitfire engulfs the pilot and elsewhere a soldier nearly drowns. (Tom Hardy plays the most critically important pilot, while a sympathetic Jack Lowden takes on a critical support role.) At one point, Mr. Nolan pulls the three narrative strands tightly together, creating a tremendous, enveloping sense of bone-deep dread.“Dunkirk” is a World War II movie, one told through soldiers, their lived and near-death experiences and their bodies under siege. Names are generally irrelevant here; on the beach — and in the sea and air — what counts are rank, unit, skill and the operation, although more important is survival, making it through another attack and somehow avoiding exploding bombs. Mr. Nolan’s emphasis on the visceral reality of Dunkirk leaves much unsaid; even in some opening explanatory text, the enemy isn’t identified as Nazi Germany. The soldiers, of course, know exactly who they are fighting and perhaps even why, but in the field the enemy is finally the unnamed stranger trying to kill them.The soldier who scrambles over the gate and onto the beach is called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) in the credits, but I don’t remember hearing or reading his name. Mostly, I just thought of him as Our Boy, less because of his youth than because of the vulnerability communicated through Mr. Whitehead’s slight figure and tangible physical performance, his small and large gestures and moves: the darting, panicked eyes; the nervous, abrupt gestures; the hunched shoulders. In time, Tommy is joined by other soldiers waiting and running and ducking on the beach, the most important played by the equally fine Aneurin Barnard and the singer Harry Styles.Mr. Nolan’s unyielding emphasis on the soldiers — and on war as it is experienced rather than on how it is strategized — blurs history even as it brings the present and its wars startlingly into view. “Dunkirk” is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s. Mr. Nolan closes that distance cinematically with visual sweep and emotional intimacy, with images of warfare and huddled, frightened survivors that together with Hans Zimmer’s score reverberate through your body. By the time that plane is burning — and a young man is looking searchingly into the future — you are reminded that the fight against fascism continues.","Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Lee Armstrong","$188,042,171","UK, Netherlands, France, USA",Christopher Nolan,"Action, Drama, History","English, French, German",94,"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German Army, and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.",PG-13,Warner Bros.

Will’s solution is to take his citified family (Megan Leonard plays the mother) on a trip to the small town where he spent his own boyhood and teach Danny how to hunt.As they arrive, the police chief (Bruce Willis, understated here) advises them to stay alert because some bank robbers have recently struck and are still at large. On their first foray into the woods, Will and Danny encounter two of them. Eventually Danny ends up as a hostage to one, Levi (Gethin Anthony, in the film’s best performance), who teaches the boy more about self-confidence and dealing with adversity than Will ever did.But to learn inner strength Danny sure does have to witness a lot of carnage. In addition to jumping on the anti-bullying bandwagon that is so popular on television and in film at the moment, the movie tries for a second bit of topicality by including a subplot pegged to the high cost of health care. It’s an awkward attempt, and the movie, directed by Steven C.

As the film opens, he arrives in a small town, Haapsalu, where he is hired at a school and given the task of running a sports club for the students.Soon Marta (Liisa Koppel) stumbles on him as he practices fencing in the gymnasium, and she wants to learn the sport. When he starts a fencing group, the children quickly take to it, even as they’re stuck with foils made from reeds in a nearby marsh. But the principal (Hendrik Toompere) fears that fencing isn’t appropriately proletarian. (While the character may be a stooge, it might have been helpful to give him at least one scene of doing something other than thwarting or sneering at Endel.)The director, Klaus Haro, films the proceedings involvingly enough, particularly when it comes time for the inevitable tournament; his flowing camera moves might be correlatives to the careful balancing required by fencing.

But adding movies to the list might only raise questions. Who would judge? Should fiction and documentary receive separate awards?An excellent example of what not to award, however, comes from “The Pulitzer at 100,” an hour and a half of congratulatory platitudes timed to the prizes’ centennial. Although produced independently, this documentary, directed by Kirk Simon, plays as if the Pulitzers were presenting an award to themselves.Past winners, including Wynton Marsalis, Paula Vogel, Tracy K. Smith and Tony Kushner, share insights on their writing processes and how the recognition has affected their careers. Celebrities like Natalie Portman and Martin Scorsese read from winning works, with which they are sometimes oddly paired.The best anecdotes aren’t simple victory laps. Nicholas D. Kristof, a New York Times columnist, who received the award for his reporting on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement and his columns about the genocide in Darfur, notes “a certain irony in gaining from a surge in human misery.” Carol D. Leonnig of The Washington Post recounts her prizewinning coverage of Secret Service lapses. John Filo and Nick Ut explain how they photographed famous images of the Vietnam era. Reporters from The Times-Picayune recall Hurricane Katrina.Yet couching these achievements in a testament to Joseph Pulitzer’s enduring genius seems trivializing.

247,GLENN KENNY,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,The Midwife,"Review: ‘The Midwife’ Is Unflappable, Until the Past Blows In",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/the-midwife-review-catherine-deneuve.html,2017-07-21,2017-07-20,"Two great French actresses, Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Frot, share the screen in this film about forgiveness and redemption.","Catherine Deneuve has played a wide variety of roles over the course of a career now spanning seven decades. But despite her exemplary range, many American viewers maintain an image of her as an aloof, exquisite, possibly imperious, possibly enigmatic beauty. This is largely because she looks like, well, Catherine Deneuve. The woman can’t help it. Even when portraying the needy, nearly shambolic Béatrice in “The Midwife,” Ms. Deneuve is capable of vibrating with an elegance that implies both hauteur and froideur.Béatrice is not the title character of this film, written and directed by Martin Provost. That is Claire, played by Catherine Frot, a superb and prolific actress whose work in French cinema is not nearly as well known here as Ms. Deneuve’s is. Claire is fantastic at her job: calm, expert, compassionate. She cares deeply about her work, which, as the movie opens, takes place at a birthing clinic that will soon be closing. She cares so deeply, for instance, that she keeps trying to resuscitate a stillborn baby, long after everyone else has faced reality, in one of the movie’s many realistic medical scenes. (This one, in particular, was sufficiently convincing to arouse my terrified curiosity as to how it was achieved. The other childbirth scenes, and there are a fair number, also look authentic.)Claire’s job appears to be the main focus of a tidy, organized, somewhat lonely life. A single mother, she has a son with whom she shares a tight bond, but he’s approaching adulthood and getting ready to strike out on his own. On weekends, and after biking home from the clinic, she tends a garden in a shared plot of land. Her neighbor there, a friendly, salt-of-the-earth truck driver named Paul — played with simple amiability by Olivier Gourmet, the wonderful actor and good-luck charm for the Belgian filmmaker brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne — takes an immediate strong liking to Claire. But she’s not terribly interested in making any human connections beyond those she has with the mothers she helps, and the babies she delivers.But then a voice from the past sends a tremor into her placid life. That would be Ms. Deneuve’s Béatrice, a former mistress of Claire’s father (now dead), whose abandonment of both her lover and his daughter engendered heartbreak and worse 30 or so years earlier.Still trying to keep up appearances, despite being in a bad place, Béatrice reaches out to Claire for the standard-issue movie melodrama reason: She’s gravely ill (with a brain tumor) and is afraid of dying alone. Yet she won’t alter her behavior, which includes a lot of smoking and drinking, some hard-core gambling and extravagant dining. Claire gives Béatrice advice, refuses her proffered gifts and tries brushing her off, but of course she cannot. The tremor becomes something of a genuine seismic event for Claire.Because it is a French film, or rather the kind of French film that wants to serve its sentimentality with a dollop of prestige, “The Midwife” doesn’t offer an entirely shameless version of the “dying free spirit imbues uptight caretaker with a new lust for life” scenario. It doesn’t spoon-feed the viewer a lot of exposition, leaving parts of the back story a little enigmatic. It drops in peculiar little character touches, including one bizarre bit concerning the resemblance between Claire’s son, Simon, and his dear departed grandfather.But it ends up where all of these movies do: spiritually (if you can call it that). Here the corporeal manifestation of the spiritual conclusion is three characters of a certain age in the cab of a moving 18-wheeler, smiling and singing along to Serge Reggiani. If there’s an American remake of this, the singer will be Jim Croce.","Catherine Deneuve, Catherine Frot, Olivier Gourmet, Quentin Dolmaire",N/A,"France, Belgium",Martin Provost,Drama,French,66,A midwife gets unexpected news from her father's old mistress.,UNRATED,N/A,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",21 Jul 2017,117 min,The Midwife,"Martin Provost (dialogue), Martin Provost (screenplay)",2017,6.8,"1,625","[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '66/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",the midwife,,,,,,,,,

In a different language, a different time period.”Mr. Clark is part of RAW Talent, a group of young people who write and perform poetry. The members decided to stage their own team-written script loosely adapted from “Romeo and Juliet,” and Jason Zeldes, the director of this documentary, “Romeo Is Bleeding,” followed along to learn about their lives and chart their progress (a plan similar to that of several films, including “Shakespeare High” and “The Hobart Shakespeareans”).Mr. Zeldes, who with Kevin Klauber also edited the documentary, uses fast cuts, varied camera angles and a patchwork of scenes to take in the varied perspectives of life in Richmond. The filmmakers walk with residents, ride with police officers and hear stories of young men who’ve been killed.This free-flowing style mimics the hip-hop and jazz-inflected rhythms of the student-poets. But it comes at a price; the portraits drawn of these young people frequently feel half-finished. As soon as a story or a profile turns compelling, the movie switches to another topic.For long stretches, “Romeo Is Bleeding” jettisons talk of Shakespeare altogether, though the real center of the film is, as it should be, the program members. They stay passionate despite discouraging circumstances. In Mr. Clark’s case, he had few options.

SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:28,Landline,"Review: In ‘Landline,’ the Family That Strays Together",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/landline-review.html,2017-07-21,2017-07-20,"Jenny Slate, John Turturro and Edie Falco star in Gillian Robespierre’s new comedy, set in 1995.","Nostalgia is not what it used to be. “Landline,” a fairly genial, diffident comedy about diffident, fairly generic people, plants its flag in 1995 and surveys a landscape of indie rock, “Must See TV” and the high-waisted bluejeans that have recently started coming back into fashion. Hillary Clinton is on television, sporting a hairband and a pink suit.Mostly, though, as the movie’s title whimsically suggests, the mid-90s were an era of adorably quaint technology. Characters make calls from pay phones and listen to messages on answering machines. They take pictures with boxy little cameras, rent videocassettes of movies and make mix tapes on actual cassette tape. The members of an upper-middle-class New York household share a single desktop computer, with a dot-matrix printer and a slot for floppy disks.One of those antique data-storage devices provides the pretext for a bit of plot. Ali (Abby Quinn), the younger of the two Jacobs daughters, discovers a trove of erotic poetry her father has been writing to someone other than his wife. These proto-sexts are part of a small epidemic of infidelity among the Jacobses. Ali’s older sister, Dana (Jenny Slate), recently engaged to her live-in boyfriend, Ben (Jay Duplass), sparks up some action on the side with Nate (Finn Wittrock), a guy she knew in college. “We’re a family of cheaters,” Ali says in disgust.“Landline” was directed by Gillian Robespierre, who wrote it with Elisabeth Holm. They also collaborated on “Obvious Child,” which starred Ms. Slate, and which was notable for the mixture of sweetness and candor it brought to the subject of abortion. There was something bracing, as well as brave, about that film’s honesty. Oddly, the new one is much more cautious and decorous in its treatment of the emotional dynamics of a complicated family. For all the profanity and naughty behavior, it has the timid, ingratiating vibe of a television sitcom, sticking to safe and familiar emotional territory.Or, more to the point, it might remind oldish viewers of a certain kind of observant, clever but unambitious independent film that came to prominence in the era it depicts. The characters are not badly drawn, but they stay within the lines. Dana is the flakier sister, and also the more responsible one. Ali is quiet, guarded and critical. She is both more reckless and more grounded than her parents suspect.The parents, meanwhile, are near-caricatures of middle-aged compromise. Alan (John Turturro) clings to his literary ambitions and works at an advertising agency. His wife, Pat (Edie Falco), works in environmental policy but doesn’t talk much about it. They refer to a wilder life back in the ’70s, but, like much else in the movie, that feels more like a talking point than like an aspect of authentic experience.Mr. Turturro and Ms. Falco, with their lived-in faces and deeply seasoned acting technique, provide Alan and Pat with more individuality than the script does. The filmmakers seem hesitant to make any of their characters too interesting. Each one is an assemblage of surface quirks and emotional responses, neatly inserted into a series of dramatic and comic situations. Some of these pay off nicely, in particular when Ms. Slate and Ms. Quinn share the screen and capture the jumpy, push-and-pull rhythms of loving but not entirely compatible sisters.It’s strange to think that if Ali and Dana were real, they would now be in their early and later 40s. The fact that they seem so much like present-day young people is less an anachronism than an aspect of the film’s hopeful, soothing attitude. It’s a peace offering from Generation X to the millennials, a gesture of solidarity from one cohort of the metropolitan upper-middle class to another. We’re just like you, and we’ll all grow up eventually.","Jenny Slate, Jay Duplass, Abby Quinn, John Turturro",N/A,USA,Gillian Robespierre,"Comedy, Drama",English,66,"In 1995, a teenager living with her sister and parents in Manhattan discovers that her father is having an affair.",R,Magnolia Pictures,"[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",21 Jul 2017,97 min,Landline,"Elisabeth Holm (story by), Gillian Robespierre (story by), Tom Bean (story by), Elisabeth Holm (screenplay by), Gillian Robespierre (screenplay by)",2017,6.4,"3,182","[{'Value': '6.4/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '66/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",landline,,,,,,,,,

Yet in the end, the most regrettable decision may be that of audience members who fork over money to see the movie.Set in and around a national park in Australia, the story starts off with that charisma-free couple, Ian (Ian Meadows) and Samantha (Harriet Dyer), who plan to pitch their tent and spend time alone in the woods. She’s prone to dispensing exposition (“I’ve got no reception,” she says as she looks at her cellphone when they arrive), while he’s more than happy to ask a weird stranger for advice.Intercut with that story is the tale of a family who previously camped in the area. The two plots, featuring the same set of predators (Aaron Pedersen and Aaron Glenane), intertwine and, after a lengthy intro, move toward some revolting cruelness.In his director’s statement, Damien Power, who also wrote the script, cites ’70s “survival thrillers” as his inspiration, and like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” this movie has the hallmarks of torture porn: gratuitous slaughter, remorseless murderers and gruesome acts.Mr. Power says his aim was to explore violence, and he generates some suspense from crosscutting the stories. But these personality-free characters fade from your mind even as you’re watching the screen, making the brutality waged against them akin to animated mutilation of cartoon creatures. Certainly, the senselessness of bloodshed may be Mr. Power’s point. But with this setup, such a message is all but muted.","Aaron Pedersen, Ian Meadows, Harriet Dyer, Aaron Glenane",N/A,Australia,Damien Power,"Horror, Thriller",English,59,A couple's camping trip turns into a frightening ordeal when they stumble across the scene of a horrific crime.,NOT RATED,IFC Films,"[{'Value': '5.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",21 Jul 2017,88 min,Killing Ground,Damien Power,2016,5.8,"5,564","[{'Value': '5.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '74%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '59/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",killing ground,,,,,,,,,

Its main characters, who live in the central Mexican city of Guanajuato, are young, gloomy, attractive men and women connected by friendship, family ties and sexual longing and divided by those same things. The movie, directed by Amat Escalante from a script he wrote with Gibrán Portela, might be a dour, observant study of modern relationships among the urban middle class were it not for the presence of a slimy, many-tentacled space creature living in a cabin in the countryside.The thing ostensibly arrived on an asteroid, but its more salient provenance is a pornographic tradition, notably but not exclusively Japanese, that occasionally slithers into the cinematic mainstream. The alien, whose gender is indeterminate, is awesome in bed, though not always gentle. While its partners, male and female, experience inexpressible and addictive bliss in its company, some of them also suffer grievous and even fatal injuries.The first one we meet is Verónica (Simone Bucio). While being treated for an alien-sex-related mishap she pretends is a dog bite, she befriends Fabián (Eden Villavicencio), a nurse. His sister, Alejandra (Ruth Ramos), is married to Ángel (Jesús Meza), a drunken macho sad sack who is having an affair with Fabián. Fabián, encouraged by Verónica, finds his way to the extraterrestrial love shack (which is tended by a sweet, hippie-ish older couple). But it’s Alejandra, neglected by Ángel and stressed out by their two young sons and Ángel’s domineering mother, who seems like the most likely victim. Or lover. Or whatever you call it.Mr. Escalante’s previous film, “Heli,” was about a factory worker caught up in Mexico’s drug violence. It contains several horrific — and now notorious — scenes of brutality, but what makes those moments especially unnerving is the low-key domestic naturalism in which they are embedded. Mr. Escalante is an exceptionally deft and subtle realist, and you sometimes feel, in “Heli” and even more so in “The Untamed” that he is drawn to extremity partly out of boredom with his own skill. And so he turns a downbeat melodrama of unhappy marriage, bohemian drift and sexual duplicity into something bizarre and horrific.There is another possibility, though, which is that “The Untamed” is not a slice-of-life tale pretending to be a monster movie, but rather a bone-dry comedy pretending to be both of those things. There is a fine line between horror and humor, and if you adjust your angle of vision accordingly, you can see the architecture of farce beneath the ornamentation of shock and suffering. The meticulous deadpan of the performances diverts attention from the absurdity of the circumstances. Fabián, Ángel and Alejandra are joined in a classic triangle, which Verónica and the alien throw into high relief even as they disrupt it.Also: Interplanetary, interspecies sex might function better as a sick joke than an earnest metaphor.

Even seasoned defenders of cryptic formalism may find it amorphous. The characters are never named, the camera work is static, and little that’s conceptually interesting materializes.The film consists of loosely connected scenes with a general focus on adolescent girls swimming, cooking, getting sun and contemplating the independence of adulthood. “Kekszakallu” eventually fixates on an almost-protagonist (Laila Maltz), who seems uninterested in work and unsure of what to study, and who somehow manages to have a car accident in a mostly empty lot.From the ostensible Bartok source — wonderfully filmed by Michael Powell in the 1960s — Mr. Solnicki takes his title (Hungarian for “Bluebeard”), snatches of music and perhaps the germ of a theme of women heading off into an unknown future.At festivals, “Kekszakallu” won praise from critics, especially those who regard the blurring of fiction and documentary (Mr. Solnicki’s background) as inherently chic. Two accomplished minimalists, Matthew Porterfield (the director and co-writer of the underseen “I Used to Be Darker”) and Martín Rejtman, are associate producers, and Mr. Porterfield is credited as a narrative contributor. But “Kekszakallu” lacks the ballast of memorable images or scenes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Already so far we have seen Mr. DeHaan, a 31-year-old actor endowed with poise, intelligence and superb eyebrows, in Gore Verbinski’s highly puzzling “A Cure for Wellness.” If you missed that one, it was more or less “The Magic Mountain” with incest and bloodsucking eels.“Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,” Mr. DeHaan’s latest eyebrow-raiser — speaking of which, it also stars Cara Delevingne, perhaps the supreme superciliary celebrity of our time — is a bit harder to describe. It was written and directed by Luc Besson (“The Fifth Element,” “Arthur and the Invisibles”) a fact that promises greater emphasis on visual panache than on feeling or coherence.That promise is faithfully kept, but there is so much more going on. To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of “The Phantom Menace” into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea.Mr. DeHaan plays Valerian and Ms. Delevingne plays Laureline, who are not his-and-hers dental hygiene products but rather soldiers in some kind of space army. They are also at least potentially a couple, a fact which authorizes a lot of dialogue that might technically be called “banter” but that seems to have lost its snap after passing through Google translate a few times too many. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are as cute as a pair of baby salamanders.Their mission — do I have to do this part? — involves justice for the planet Mül. Before it was destroyed, Mül was a beachy paradise, a perpetual Ibiza on the morning after the best rave ever, populated by hairless lizard supermodels. The key to their bliss is a pocket-size dinosaur that excretes pearls. Only one is left in the universe. Valerian and Laureline are its intrepid pet-sitters.What about the City of a Thousand Planets? It’s a multicultural celestial metropolis where our heroes do a bit of chasing and fighting, and its population includes some fine specimens of modern digital and prosthetic creature design as well as a few that are a bit, let’s say, problematic. The City might be an interesting place to spend some time if a busy and chaotic story didn’t keep getting in the way, and if we were allowed to hang out for a little while longer with Ethan Hawke and Rihanna.She’s in this movie! Believe the posters, even though she shows up late and leaves early. She’s called Bubble, she dances on a stripper pole and changes costumes in the blink of an eye until Mr. Besson’s script cruelly casts her aside. Why? So we can ponder the villainy of Clive Owen in uniform? So we can watch Mr. DeHaan and Ms. Delevingne doing their finger-puppet Rock Hudson/Doris Day act? So we can come up with names for Valerian and Laureline’s babies?I don’t know, and I suspect Mr. Besson doesn’t either. Though it is based on a popular graphic novel series by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières, “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets” feels as if it were made up on the spot, by someone so delighted by the gaudy genre packaging at his disposal that he lost track of what was supposed to be inside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-02 04:18:27,Girls Trip,"Review: In ‘Girls Trip,’ Women Giddily Under the Influence",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/movies/girls-trip-review-dargis-queen-latifah-regina-hall-tiffany-haddish-jada-pinkett-smith.html,2017-07-21,2017-07-19,"In the affably amusing, sometimes spittingly funny “Girls Trip,” a weekend getaway brings trouble, laughs and sisterhood.","Girls gone wild, ladies on the loose, chicks out for kicks — the spectacle of women behaving badly is having its moment (again). In the 1930s, runaway brides ran amok with banter and high jinks; in the 1940s, femmes fatales did their men wrong with lipstick sneers and a bullet to the heart. The latest iteration of this type of movie often skews comic and generally involves a group of gal pals getting together for some “we time.” They find trouble and, here’s hoping, their bliss amid oceans of booze and maybe drugs, sometimes in the company of men, who are alternately helpful or hapless.The affably amusing, sometimes spittingly funny comedy “Girls Trip” recycles much of the same naughty women idea used and occasionally abused in movies like “Bad Moms” and “Sisters.” As in the recent “Rough Night,” the women in “Girls Trip” are old college friends who, after going down their respective paths, are reuniting for better and, at times, for worse. In “Rough Night,” the regulation naughtiness ends up with the women, who are mostly white, accidentally (uh-oh) killing a man. That isn’t on the menu for the black women in “Girls Trip,” who, despite being fictional also exist in our world and so presumably would have a much harder time giggling their way out of spilling blood.That makes “Girls Trip” seem tamer than a movie like “Rough Night.” But “Girls Trip” is also funnier; it’s also more appealing because it knows that there’s more at stake existentially for women, and especially for black women, than out-grossing men. The friends in “Girls Trip” have other issues to work on, all of which are grounded in ordinary life: how to live in the world with love and joy, how to nurture intimate relationships so they don’t slip away, how to balance professional and personal obligations without going nuts, how to perform fairly tricky sexual acts without embarrassing you or your partner right out of bed — you know, the usual.An invitation brings the friends and story in “Girls Trip” together. It’s sent by Ryan (Regina Hall), an entrepreneurial self-help guru who is rapidly heading toward Oprah-level celebrity. With a megawatt smile, an affirmation for every occasion and a beautiful husband by her side (a thankless role, capably handled by Mike Colter), Ryan seems to have it all. She’s turned her life into a brand by selling other women on the idea that they can have it all, too, but now she’s not so sure. After being tapped to speak at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, she invites three friends along for a weekend of sharing, caring and boozing, topped with guest turns from the likes of Common and Sean Combs.Enjoyment turns out to be contagious in “Girls Trip,” which consistently manages to rework and even reinvigorate some severely worn-out conceits, setups and character types, mostly by complicating gender roles with class issues. The struggler is Sasha (Queen Latifah), a former serious journalist turned flailing gossip blogger; the wallflower, Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), is a nurse and single mom; the cutup, Dina (Tiffany Haddish), well, it’s unclear what she does. She works, kind of, in an office or did — even her boss seems baffled about her status — but mostly Dina is the crazy snake in the can, the whoopee in the cushion and the movie’s biggest, rowdiest laugh generator.The director Malcolm D. Lee (“The Best Man”) helps turn these types into characters efficiently and sympathetically — he knows how to light and frame a beautiful face — though every so often you sense he would like to cut loose visually. Mostly, he serves Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver’s script, which goes high, low and sincere as it mixes some slapstick in with the sober bits, giddily indulges its freewheeling silliness and drops heart-to-hearts ranging from a sharply comic lesson on white privilege to a hilarious riff on the joys of grapefruit sex. (Ms. Oliver and Mr. Barris, who created the sitcom “black-ish,” also wrote “Barbershop: The Next Cut,” which Mr. Lee directed.)Like most movies of this comic ilk, including the male-centric “Hangover” types, “Girls Trip” is effectively a narrative striptease. Characters — mostly ordinary, straight, middle-class types — take some of it off, the “it” being the cultural and social norms that define and often restrict them: the veneer of respectability, the accommodating smiles, the regulation control. At times this involves female characters testing, gingerly if fleetingly, the limits of that construct called femininity. “Girls Trip” adds complexity to the picture by bringing in class, even as it dispatches with whiteness, showing it the door so that these women can find themselves while rediscovering the power and pleasures of sisterhood.","Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Tiffany Haddish","$115,088,305","USA, Canada",Malcolm D.

In the late 1990s, a Dutch couple, Martin Verfondern and Margo Pool, post-hippie types looking to carve out a place for themselves far from the modern-day rat race — to get off the grid, as some say today — found an isolated village there whose name, Santa Eulalia, has over the years been compressed to Santoalla. At the opening of this documentary with the same name, directed by Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer, it’s plain that things did not work out as planned for the couple: Home-video footage shows Martin approaching a neighbor who calmly raises the handle of a farm tool and brings it down on the camera, causing the recording to go black.Ms. Pool narrates this chronicle, talking about how her husband disappeared in 2010, as Mr. Becker and Mr. Mehrer jump around in time. The couple are initially portrayed as sympathetic. Their only neighbors in Santoalla are the Rodriguez family, made up of the quiet patriarch, Manolo (he’s the camera smiter); the chatty, religious wife, Jovita; and their two sons, the voluble Carlos and Julio, who suffers from mental disorders.At first these families get along reasonably well. As the filmmakers introduce more archival footage, Mr. Verfondern comes across as less laid-back as he initially seemed. His plans for developing his land into some utopian retreat often run afoul of the Rodriguezes, and a dispute over shared forest areas leads to a courtroom battle. Soon the families aren’t even speaking to each other. Then Mr. Verfondern vanishes, seemingly without a trace. At this point the narrative deliberately goes slack as Ms. Pool weighs her options. “Santoalla” ends with the mystery solved. The threads that remain hanging imbue this peculiar story of paradise lost with a tragic resonance.","Carlos Rodríguez, Jovita Rodríguez, Julio Rodríguez, Manolo Rodríguez",N/A,"Spain, USA","Andrew Becker, Daniel Mehrer","Documentary, Mystery","English, Gallegan",68,"A Dutch couple, Martin and Margo Verfondern, move to a remote Spanish village of Santoalla to start a new life.

As it succumbs to an invisible menace, this entity’s colors (brilliant shades of amber, magenta, chartreuse) turn fluorescent blue and purple and green before fading to bright white. As it decays, wisps of sludge drip from the skeletal remains.Apocalyptic sci-fi? This is real life, in the documentary “Chasing Coral.” And it’s an environmental tragedy of our own making, the film heartbreakingly argues, that has little hope of being reversed without immediate human intervention.The director Jeff Orlowski and Richard Vevers, the founder of the Ocean Agency and a driving force behind this film, teamed up to show the toll of climate change on coral reefs. Using his 2012 documentary, “Chasing Ice,” in which time-lapse technology showed the melting of glaciers, as his guide, Mr. Orlowski frames “Chasing Coral” with a similar structure. But setting up time-lapse camera rigs deep underwater off the coasts of Caribbean islands, Hawaii and Australia proved problematic. At one point, the assembled team of researchers has to document the deadly transformation of the Great Barrier Reef manually: diving with special cameras to meticulously record the day-to-day changes on the ocean floor. Once-thriving marine metropolises, teeming with sting rays, turtles, little yellow fish and big-eyed predators, gradually wither away into a wasteland of muck.The film gives a scientific breakdown of the biology of coral (these complex organisms play a vital role in the marine ecosystem) and the cause of the bleaching events leading to its demise: Trapped greenhouse gases have been warming oceans more rapidly since the 1980s, and a two-degree increase is fatal. But the film is particularly compelling when following Zack Rago, a self-proclaimed coral nerd whose love is palpable and infectious. The work takes a toll on his spirits, never more so than when after weeks of dives, he encounters what has essentially become a grave site, barely resembling what was once a fertile haven.Perhaps the most striking moment is when the divers must cross the deck of a party boat to gain access to a section of the Great Barrier Reef. The revelers hardly even notice the weary dive team, trying to spread the word of imminent doom.","Andrew Ackerman, Pim Bongaerts, Neal Cantin, Phil Dustan",N/A,USA,Jeff Orlowski,Documentary,English,86,"Coral reefs around the world are vanishing at an unprecedented rate.

Rather, this feather-light French confection, written and directed by Paul Calori and Kostia Testut, addresses its dignity-of-work thesis with sweetness and heart.The songs are unmemorable and the choreography less than twinkle-toed, but the lyrics are a delight.“Part-time jobs ain’t fine,” trills Julie (Pauline Étienne), the determined young striver at the movie’s squishy-soft center. “Filling in forms, standing in line.” Echoing the plight of millions of young Europeans, Julie longs for permanent work, so when she lands a probationary position in the stockroom of a luxury shoe factory, the eruption of a labor dispute threatens to undermine her plans.A cri de coeur against outsourcing and downsizing, “Footnotes” bossa novas its way through myriad themes without leaving a dent in any of them. Feminism (the shoe stitchers are all women), French craftsmanship and lack of respect for middle management are all lyricized, while empty design studios underscore the precariousness of couture itself. Love is dangled, in the smoky form of “I’m just a lonesome trucker” Samy (Olivier Chantreau), but Julie’s not having any of it. Not for the first 80 minutes, anyway.Softening the edges of working-class dreams, the cinematographer Julien Meurice washes scenes in pale pastels and hazy light.

Not Clare (Joey King), though, the wistful teenager in “Wish Upon” who’s traumatized by what she believes was her mother’s suicide many years earlier. Embarrassed by her Dumpster-diving father (Ryan Phillippe) and hounded by the resident high school meanie, Clare wishes only to be rich, popular and adored by her hunky crush. Maybe this funny-looking music box covered in Chinese characters can help?As directed by John R. Leonetti, “Wish Upon” would rather make you jump than gag. The splatter is deployed cautiously and sometimes wittily, the story moving briskly from wishes granted to costs exacted with the help of familiar faces (including a warm Sherilyn Fenn as Clare’s surrogate mother) and a sympathetic lead. Pressing gently on the bruise of a broken home to explain Clare’s addiction to the evil receptacle (in a move that recalls “The Possession” a few years back), Barbara Marshall’s zippy script cuts corners without severing its bond to Clare’s emotions.

Demi Moore is Suzanne, who ends up as collateral damage when her husband, Mark (Dylan McDermott), is arrested on charges related to a shady stock deal. Suzanne’s community-service sentence involves reading to cranky Blind Bill, and they instantly clash, so of course they will soon be hot and heavy for each other, especially since Suzanne has been chafing under the thumb of her domineering husband.If that premise is wince-inducing, so is much of the dialogue. (The story is by Diane Fisher, the screenplay by John Buffalo Mailer; both Mailers are sons of Norman.) Mr. McDermott, especially, has a lot of clichés to mouth.

It’s no spoiler to say that the filmmakers start to believe that the organization is based on a fraud: The very first scene is of Ms. Heitz, stepping out of an interview with a parent who was said to have made such a sale — her first without Mr. Choothesa interpreting. Almost in a daze, she murmurs, “It’s all a big lie.”The film’s first half chronicles the events leading to that interview; the girls who live at the organization and go to school in Chiang Mai are bright and motivated, and glad for the opportunities their families in the hill tribes of Northern Thailand lack. But they later burst into tears when they hear how they and their families have been presented in materials to donor groups — put, as one says, in “the wrong light.”Even so, perhaps the families are denying the truth out of shame.

SCOTT,0,2017-11-02 04:18:27,Endless Poetry,"Review: ‘Endless Poetry,’ Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Surreal Self-Portrait",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/movies/review-endless-poetry-alejandro-jodorowskys-surreal-self-portrait.html,2017-07-14,2017-07-13,An 88-year-old polymath’s nostalgic look back on the Chilean literary scene in the late 1940s.,"Alejandro Jodorowsky has had a long and productive life. In addition to directing midnight-movie classics like “El Topo” and “The Holy Mountain,” he has composed music and written many books. He is an expert on the tarot and psychotherapy. But in his two recent autobiographical films — “The Dance of Reality” and now “Endless Poetry” — Mr. Jodorowsky, at 88, shows the irrepressible energy of a man who is just getting started.The main character in “Endless Poetry” is exactly that: a 20-ish Alejandro (played by the director’s son Adan) discovering his literary vocation in Chile in the late 1940s. Burning with ambition and existential hunger, Alejandro makes his way through bohemian Santiago, collecting friends, lovers, mentors and muses among the city’s artists and writers. Some of their names — Nicanor Parra, Stella Díaz Varín and Enrique Lihn — can be found in the annals of 20th-century Chilean literature. Along with Pablo Larraín’s “Neruda,” this film would be a useful assignment in an introductory course on the subject.Not that there is anything remotely dry or academic about Mr. Jodorowsky’s approach to the story of his own life. “I’m going to save Surrealism,” his younger self declares, and “Endless Poetry” makes good on that vow with a barrage of improbable situations and bizarre, sometimes grotesque images. The most surreal effect may be the casting. Mr. Jodorowsky in his present gray-bearded state shows up to narrate, and in addition to Adan, another son, Brontis, appears onscreen, reprising the role of Alejandro’s bullying, insecure father, which he played in “The Dance of Reality.”That film was infused with the wonders and terrors of childhood, and was a tour de force of Freudian mischief and Felliniesque nostalgia. “Endless Poetry,” telling a more diffuse story, doesn’t reach quite the same level of intensity, but it is testament to the relentless energy and undimmed ingenuity of its creator and a moving defense of the prerogatives of the imagination.Realism is not on the agenda, but Mr. Jodorowsky nonetheless evokes the chaotic, passionate spirit of a time and offers astute insights into his own psychology. He uses masquerade, puppetry, theatrical lighting and set design and the luridly expressive cinematography of the great Christopher Doyle to create a world of hallucinatory artifice. Alejandro’s mother, Sara, who sings all her dialogue in fluting operatic tones, is played by Pamela Flores, who also plays Stella, the young poet’s beer-drinking, cigar-smoking protector and sort-of lover. This doubling is mirrored by the resemblance between Adan Jodorowsky and Leandro Taub, who plays Alejandro’s pal and sort-of rival Enrique Lihn.For all of these characters, poetry is fundamentally a sensual undertaking, and Mr. Jodorowsky is a voracious poet of the flesh. It’s too easy to describe his interest in unusually large and small bodies, in wounded and painted skin, in amputation and contortion as perverse, freakish or provocative. That language belongs to the patriarchal world of propriety and repression, against which Alejandro’s life is one long protest. The images in “Endless Poetry” are arresting and sometimes disturbing, but there is an earnest commitment to ecstasy and authenticity that renders moot any question of offensiveness or exploitation.Coherence may also be beside the point. “Endless Poetry” is never boring, but it has a tendency to meander and repeat itself. Mr. Jodorowsky is a poet in the broadest sense, a restless artist whose temperament isn’t wedded to any particular form. He seems to embrace cinema out of convenience. He can’t beam his visions directly into your brain, or tattoo his words on your body, but this is the next best thing.","Adan Jodorowsky, Brontis Jodorowsky, Leandro Taub, Pamela Flores","&pound;28,000","Chile, UK, France",Alejandro Jodorowsky,"Biography, Drama, Fantasy","Spanish, French, English",78,"Surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky tells the story of himself as a young man becoming a poet in Chile, befriending other artists, and freeing himself from the limits of his youth.",UNRATED,N/A,"[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",14 Jul 2017,128 min,Endless Poetry,Alejandro Jodorowsky,2016,7.7,"3,510","[{'Value': '7.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '93%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '78/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",endless poetry,,,,,,,,,

In this British movie, a young 19th-century woman finds passion, makes mischief and commits murder.","It takes a while to figure out who the title character in “Lady Macbeth” really is. You may think you know her, that she’s the one who sleeps with death, the one pouring evil into her husband’s ear. Certainly the invocation of Shakespeare tips that there’s something dangerous about the lady of its house, an opaque beauty called Katherine (a very fine Florence Pugh). Yet part of this movie’s ticklish nastiness is that at first it isn’t at all clear whether she will be the master of doom or its helpmate. At just 17, Katherine looks like the innocent flower, but something wicked this way comes seductively, then savagely.Set in 1865 rural England, “Lady Macbeth” opens with Katherine at the marriage altar, her head draped in a white veil that suggests virtue and slyly hints at the blood that will spill. She’s soon in the bedroom with her husband, Alexander (Paul Hilton), a scowler with angry, accusatory eyes who isn’t interested in her sexually or any other way. Their first night together, he brusquely orders her to undress, only to crawl into bed, leaving her naked, untouched and puzzled. This remains the template for a somewhat mysteriously cheerless, loveless marriage that finds Katherine more of a prisoner than a wife.Not much happens at first, beautifully. Katherine is soon bored, but the director, William Oldroyd, ensures that you aren’t, with his use of sepulchral quiet, mesmerizingly steady framing and unnerving order, in which nothing is ever out of place, especially nothing human. There seem to be no books in the house, which is maintained by beaten-down servants and overseen by Alexander’s even more unpleasant father, Boris (a good Christopher Fairbank). Everything looks superficially lovely, especially Katherine, who is brushed and cinched, primped and readied by her maid, Anna (Naomi Ackie), like a doll that no one plays with. It’s unclear if Katherine can read; at times she barely speaks.For the most part, Katherine watches, and we watch her watching, as the quiet grows louder, and the stillness grows eerier. Bidden to stay indoors — somehow the fresh air would be bad for her, or so the men of the house insist — she spends much of her time staring out a window, a familiar pastime for repressed, yearning women in fiction. Of Madame Bovary, the theorist Stephen Heath wrote: “The window is the frame of Emma’s dissatisfaction.” The same holds true for Katherine, whose window reveals the life that she’s been cut off from, even as it reminds her, day after lonely night, of the freedom on the other side of the glass.Something happens, of course, rocking Katherine, the story and the visual order. Alexander leaves — there’s trouble at the family colliery — creating a void that she rapidly fills. She starts a bold, increasingly reckless affair with a groomsman, Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), a rough number wildly out of his league and depth. Adultery soon begets murder, but even when Katherine is standing over a second corpse, it’s not obvious whether she’s a newly sprung prisoner of gender with a reasonable sociopolitical alibi (the patriarchy made her do it!) or just a psychopath in a fetching peacock-blue gown. Mr. Oldroyd doesn’t tip his hand, forcing you to choose.The movie is based on “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,” an 1865 novella by Nikolai Leskov that Dmitri Shostakovich turned into an opera and Andrzej Wajda adapted into a film. Like the novella, the movie opens up some interpretive leeway as it invites your sympathy for Katherine. She’s an unambiguous captive, trapped by sex and class, yet the viciousness that her liberation awakens — as carnal lust slips into bloodlust — precludes a facile redemptive reading. Mr. Oldroyd boxes Katherine in his attractive visuals, imprisoning her as her male relatives do. Yet his intellectual distance also turns her into a specimen, a pinned butterfly turned taxidermy beast.Written by Alice Birch, this version of “Lady Macbeth” is most successfully complicated by Anna, a sympathetic character who doesn’t exist in the novella but takes on mounting importance here. Katherine, having been radically isolated by her husband and father-in-law, has no friends. Anna is Katherine’s closest companion by default and serves as maid and occasional minder; over time, Anna also becomes a moving, horrified witness to Katherine’s crimes, emotion that warms the insistent chill. That Anna is played by a black actress, and Katherine by a white one, adds race to the thickening intrigue, making a story of female oppression and domination, power and privilege that much more harrowing and ugly.","Florence Pugh, Cosmo Jarvis, Paul Hilton, Naomi Ackie","$1,128,187",UK,William Oldroyd,"Drama, Romance",English,76,"In 19th-century rural England, a young bride who has been sold into marriage discovers an unstoppable desire within herself as she enters into an affair with a worker on her estate.",R,Roadside Attractions,"[{'Value': '6.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",14 Jul 2017,89 min,Lady Macbeth,"Nikolai Leskov (based on Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk), Alice Birch",2016,6.9,"13,101","[{'Value': '6.9/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '90%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '76/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",lady macbeth,Lady Macbeth,Roadside Attractions,124.0,134.0,6.0,21.0,1129408.0,84.0,17444.0

The thesis here is that, after Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, opponents of the decision spent the next 40 years organizing an incremental offensive on multiple fronts to restrict access to abortion, contraception and sterilization by piling on state regulations and putting forward political candidates to further their cause.The anti-abortion talking heads in the film do not deny the strategy, nor do they get much of the spotlight. This documentary, directed by Civia Tamarkin and written by Ms. Tamarkin and Luchina Fisher, argues that new laws have stripped away health services unrelated to abortion and have deprived women, particularly those with lower incomes, of routine care. While women’s clinics and providers were attacked by violent extremists and closed as funding dried up, more insidious, less publicized changes, including the legislation and the mergers and acquisitions that brought hospitals under the control of religious groups, were having far-reaching effects.The case histories are stacked to support the film’s point of view, but that doesn’t make them less painful. Worst are the new mothers jailed on child-abuse charges because of drug tests administered without their knowledge. The victims are the babies, left motherless. One woman had to wait out a nonviable pregnancy because the law forbade inducing labor after 20 weeks. A single mother with several children was denied sterilization surgery because of a hospital’s religious beliefs; Medicaid limited her providers, and she could not afford to travel to a distant clinic.

265,A.O. SCOTT,1,2017-11-02 04:18:27,War for the Planet of the Apes,Review: New ‘Planet of the Apes’ Makes You Root Against Your Species,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/movies/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-review.html,2017-07-14,2017-07-12,"With Andy Serkis reprising his role as Caesar, “War for the Planet of the Apes” is a humane western wrapped around a prison movie, as primates battle for primacy.","There is a scene toward the end of “War for the Planet of the Apes” that is as vivid and haunting as anything I’ve seen in a Hollywood blockbuster in ages, a moment of rousing and dreadful cinematic clarity that I don’t expect to shake off any time soon. I’ll tread lightly, but I don’t think anything I say here can spoil its power.Two groups of humans have just battled, and the victors, having slaughtered the enemy, burst into raucous cheers. It’s the kind of thing we’ve seen in movies dozens of times before: the cheapening of mass death into an easy win for the good guys. Except that in this case we, the humans in the theater seats, are not the only ones watching. A crowd of apes is also present, an emerging society whose national epic this film and its companions have marvelously and improbably become. The apes pause to witness the aftermath of the carnage they have narrowly escaped, and their wordless, shocked response, registered above all on the face of Caesar, their leader, is an eloquent rebuke to a species that has abandoned any but a biological claim to the name human.Recall that “ape not kill ape” is the political and moral foundation of ape civilization, handed down by Caesar, their Moses, though he hasn’t always obeyed this commandment. The spectacle of people’s rejoicing in the destruction of their own kind is upsetting, and as the audience absorbs the apes’ shock, we become aware of another, deeper unease. We are now, three movies into this reborn franchise, entirely on the side of the apes. The prospect of our own extinction, far from horrifying, comes as a relief. At last the poor planet will catch a break.Or, to put it another way, Koba was right.If you saw “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” — the second chapter in the series so far, bridging “Rise” and “War” — you may recall that poor, abused laboratory chimp’s evolution from victim to nemesis. The damage Koba had suffered at the hands of humans made him intolerant and fanatical, an embodiment of political extremism who needed to be checked, and ultimately destroyed, by Caesar, whose political temperament tended toward moderation and compromise. Their conflict was mirrored by a struggle on the human side between a genocidal, ape-hating military commander and a rival leader who believed in coexistence.“Dawn,” like “Rise” before it, rested on a hopeful, slightly hokey message of interspecies harmony. In spite of their differences and mutual suspicions, maybe the two primate societies, one coalescing while the other slid toward chaos, could share the Earth, or at least the stretch of Northern California forest where this franchise plants its allegorical flag.Times change. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” directed by Matt Reeves, is the grimmest episode so far, and also the strongest, a superb example — rare in this era of sloppily constructed, commercially hedged cinematic universes — of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking. The distinction of this run of “Planet of the Apes” movies has been its commitment to the venerable belief that science fiction belongs to the literature of ideas, and its willingness to risk seeming to take itself too seriously. Each episode has pursued a stark ethical or political problem, and each has shifted the moral ground from human to ape.“Rise” was about how people treat and mistreat animals, about the tension between recognizing them as sentient beings and the long habit of exploiting and confining them. “Dawn” was a wishful parable of decolonization and counterinsurgency, concerned with the competing but equally legitimate claims of two tribes occupying adjacent territory. “War” — which, in spite of its title, is less a war film than a western wrapped around a prison movie — vindicates Koba’s view of humanity as irredeemably cruel and deceitful.The memory of Koba’s own treachery is kept alive, as some of his followers have drifted from militant anti-Caesarism to collaboration with the enemy species. There is a new nemesis in town, a renegade colonel played by Woody Harrelson, who goes full Heart of Darkness, staging a one-man remake of “Apocalypse Now” in a medical base he has refashioned into a concentration camp. He has Marlon Brando’s clean-shaven dome, Robert Duvall’s mirrored sunglasses and Dennis Hopper’s manic verbosity. The horror! The horror!Really, though, it’s a lot of fun, in spite of the somber picture I’ve been painting. Mr. Reeves, who also directed “Dawn,” has a dark vision, but also a light touch when necessary, and, above all, a commitment to creating a world that is coherent as well as fantastical. This world is also intensely and somewhat unimaginatively masculine. The default setting for primate social organization in these movies, human and otherwise, is patriarchal, and while a few female apes and a young human girl appear on screen, the filmmakers’ inability to flesh out the familial and affective dimensions of an otherwise richly rendered reality is frustrating.But still, the motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up. Andy Serkis’s performance as Caesar is one of the marvels of modern screen acting, and it’s complemented by those of Karin Konoval, reprising her role as the wise orangutan Maurice, and Steve Zahn, as a sad-clown sidekick named Bad Ape.Caesar and Maurice communicate in primitive English and sign language, and for long stretches their adventures unfold without much human interaction, though they do adopt a mute human orphan (Amiah Miller) shortly before they meet Bad Ape. Our ilk is in a bad way, and not only because of the fanatical, desperate militarism represented by the Colonel. A new strain of virus is robbing people of their ability to speak, accelerating a reversal of species hierarchy set in motion two movies ago when Caesar first howled the word “no.”He is a grayer, sadder hero now, and in “War” he succumbs for a while to a vengeful impulse at odds with his essential high-mindedness. You could say that he is putting his humanity at risk, or that he’s only human, after all, but of course both descriptions would be absurd. We’ll have to come up with a new vocabulary, but while we still have this one — and while flesh-and-blood people are still directing digital gorillas and chimps — I’ll just say that it’s good to see a movie so thoroughly humane.","Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn, Karin Konoval","$146,872,826","USA, Canada, New Zealand",Matt Reeves,"Action, Adventure, Drama","English, American Sign Language",82,"After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.",PG-13,20th Century Fox,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",14 Jul 2017,140 min,War for the Planet of the Apes,"Mark Bomback, Matt Reeves, Rick Jaffa (based on characters created by), Amanda Silver (based on characters created by)",2017,7.5,"185,055","[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '93%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '82/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",war for the planet of the apes,War for the Planet of the Apes,20th Century Fox,2485.0,12.0,46.0,54.0,146843711.0,119.0,17479.0

The sight of her working up a sweat in this fashion is what audience members initially see as they file into the performance space where her solo show is being staged, and she continues for quite some time after they are seated.“When something is going on for so long, there’s a transformation,” she explains in an interview that is intercut throughout the director Andrew Rossi’s documentary, also called “Bronx Gothic,” about Ms. Okpokwasili and her work.The stage piece (reviewed in The New York Times in 2014) uses dance, song and spoken word, combined with various forms of stagecraft. Ms. Okpokwasili’s fearless writing and intense, virtuosic performance style make the story, of two black girls discovering their sexuality while growing up in the Bronx, seem torn from her own life. (The piece is not autobiographical, however.) Ideas of female and black beauty are explored with language that is frequently profane — hardly any of it is quotable here — and always charged. The narrative unfolds via a series of letters Ms. Okpokwasili reads from, but her words are punctuated by movements that are at times balletic, at other times pure James Brown meets punk rock. She hits the stage floor hard, and more than once.The movie shows her interacting with audience members in Q. and A. sessions during a tour of the piece, doting on her lovely daughter and having pointed discussions about race with her husband, Peter Born — who is white and also the director of the stage work. These scenes are interesting and sometimes genuinely illuminating. Mr. Born can be a bit pedantic when speaking with his wife about “black victimhood” in popular culture, citing “12 Years a Slave” as an example that seems to irritate him.Ms. Okpokwasili doesn’t say much in response, but her face indicates a certain impatience with Mr. Born’s view. Later in the film the family visits Ms. Okpokwasili’s parents, who are Nigerian immigrants. They are somewhat hesitant to watch a video of their daughter’s piece. Once they do, though, Ms. Okpokwasili’s mother likens her daughter’s style of movement to Nigerian dance, and gives a demonstration that’s both moving and revealing.In the end, Ms. Okpokwasili’s often academic-sounding exegeses of her work become repetitive. Given the aesthetically confrontational nature of the piece, one can understand why Mr. Rossi did not attempt an undiluted cinematic translation of the complete “Bronx Gothic.” But something about his approach (which I assume was approved by Ms. Okpokwasili, as she is one of the movie’s executive producers) feels, finally, like an evasion.",Okwui Okpokwasili,N/A,USA,Andrew Rossi,Documentary,English,66,"From director Andrew Rossi (Page One: Inside the New York Times, The First Monday in May) comes an electrifying portrait of writer and performer Okwui Okpokwasili and her acclaimed ...",N/A,Abstract Media,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",12 Jul 2017,91 min,Bronx Gothic,N/A,2017,6.7,20,"[{'Value': '6.7/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '44%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '66/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",bronx gothic,,,,,,,,,
267,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-02 04:18:27,City of Ghosts,"Review: In ‘City of Ghosts,’ Fighting ISIS With Journalism",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/movies/city-of-ghosts-review.html,2017-07-07,2017-07-06,"In this documentary, Matthew Heineman (“Cartel Land”) focuses on the gutsy Syrian citizen-journalist group called Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently.","In 796, the caliph Harun al-Rashid moved the seat of the Muslim Empire to the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, on the banks of the Euphrates. There, Harun — the inspiration for a caliph in “One Thousand and One Nights” — is said to have played polo and perfumed the air with garments worn by female slaves. Raqqa’s later history largely registers as more mundane, a tale of declines and revivals that turned catastrophic when the Islamic State, or ISIS, seized it in 2014, making the city its effective capital. American-backed forces are currently battling ISIS for control of a city in ruins.“City of Ghosts,” a blunt instrument of a documentary, is an urgent and heart-heavy account of Syrian resistance from the ground up. Specifically, it recounts the story and activism of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, or R.B.S.S., a citizen-journalist initiative that emerged in April 2014 to secretly record the atrocities committed by ISIS in Raqqa. (R.B.S.S.’s website states that the group is nonpartisan and explains that it is “a campaign launched by a group of nonviolent activists in Raqqa to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and terrorist extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” toward civilians in that city.)Directed by Matthew Heineman, “City of Ghosts” primarily focuses on three R.B.S.S. activists identified by their first names — Aziz, Hamoud and Mohamad — who, even after being forced to flee Raqqa, intently work to get images and information about the city out into the world. Mr. Heineman, who is also the movie’s cinematographer, more or less opens and closes the documentary in 2015 with some of the activists in New York, where R.B.S.S. received an award from the nonprofit group the Committee to Protect Journalists. It’s a distracting framing device that suggests Mr. Heineman believed that he first needed to give his audience reassuringly recognizable faces. Cut to David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, at the podium.“City of Ghosts” is best when it lets the activists tell their own stories, which they do in smoothly edited tag-team voice-over, in on-camera scenes from their life abroad and in ghastly underground images recorded in Raqqa. It’s an account of heroic resistance that essentially begins in 2011 when the Arab Spring reached Syria (“we started to scream for freedom”), and peaceful demonstrations against President Assad were met with state violence followed by power grabs. Along the way, Mr. Heineman furnishes a sketchy look at the various players and geopolitical stakes, glossing over Syria’s historical complexities and the role that the United States has played in the rise of ISIS.The activists come across as ordinary men made extraordinary by circumstance; some seem almost surprised at where life and war have taken them. Aziz was a student who became a spokesman, and Mohamad was a teacher turned reporter, but not much else about the group’s origins comes through. Mr. Heineman glides over the nuts and bolts of its operational beginning. He may not have thought it germane, or maybe thought covering it might have endangered lives. Or perhaps Mr. Heineman, an excitingly visceral director — his last documentary was “Cartel Land” — thought it might slow this fast-paced feature down. Like the Arab Spring represented in the movie, R.B.S.S. almost seems to have spontaneously erupted.That’s unfortunate because more information and in-depth analysis, as well as greater restraint in the use of atrocity images, might have deepened a movie that leans on shortcuts and visual shocks. In “City of Ghosts,” Mr. Heineman marshals some incredible material — including on-the-run undercover cellphone imagery — into a moving record of extraordinary individual and collective heroism, one that eventually emphasizes the personal over the political. You admire Aziz, Hamoud, Mohamad and their partisan compatriots. And soon you fear for them too, worrying over their every move as they fight an enemy that is scarily near. Yet as these men come into the focus, Raqqa and the region recede.As the activists struggle to keep Raqqa alive for the world, funneling news to outside agencies, the dead in this movie — decapitated, crucified, shot — come close to overwhelming the living. In a few instances, Mr. Heineman shows men being shot point blank in the head; elsewhere, he cuts way before the fatal moment, which turns these murders into appalling cinematic cliffhangers. He seems to believe that it’s crucial to include numerous unfiltered ISIS atrocities, but raw and blurred versions of savagery prove this false. Mr. Heineman is clearly passionate and sincere, but he doesn’t fully grasp the power of suggestion or the audience’s capacity for empathy. You don’t need to watch a man die to understand the horror of his death.","Matt Dillon, James Caan, Natascha McElhone, Gérard Depardieu","$275,998",USA,Matt Dillon,"Crime, Drama, Thriller","English, French, Khmer, Russian",57,"A con man (Matt Dillon) travels to Cambodia (also on the run from law enforcement in the U.S.) to collect his share in an insurance scam, but discovers more than he bargained for.",R,MGM Pictures,"[{'Value': '6.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",27 Mar 2003,116 min,City of Ghosts,"Matt Dillon, Barry Gifford",2002,6,"4,556","[{'Value': '6.0/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '47%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '57/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",city of ghosts,,,,,,,,,

Some have sensory issues with touch and sound. That’s all the more reason to have the Jersey Hammerheads, the Special Olympics swimming team Mr. McQuay founded with his wife, Maria, inspired by Mikey, their son.Mikey, one of the Hammerheads’ stars, is among the three principal subjects of “Swim Team,” a documentary by Lara Stolman. (An excerpt from the movie appeared on The New York Times’s website in 2015.) The others are Robbie, who says he aspires to be faster than Michael Phelps, and Kelvin, who has Tourette’s syndrome in addition to autism.Made over the course of two years, the documentary follows the challenges they face, both personally and as a group. (We’ll avoid spoiling which one went on to compete nationally and which one became captain of his high school swim team.) The movie also trails their parents, who raise their children — mostly teenagers — without a rule book, at times feeling isolated themselves, but finding camaraderie in one another. Near the end, Mr. McQuay says he believes that having an autistic son made him a more attentive father.Issue documentaries often struggle to come across as movies, not simply as informational tools. At its most effective, “Swim Team” treats its subjects as would any sports movie attuned to character and drama. There is real suspense when Robbie runs late for a meet, risking setting back his entire team.Later, Maria and Michael believe that the Hammerheads have come in first at a meet and are upset to see them receive only participation medals. (They soon realize that they lost the gold because one of the team’s members — not among the three profiled — earned a disqualification for starting a race with the wrong stroke.)Elsewhere, “Swim Team” deals more specifically with autism. Maria and Michael meet with a lawyer to determine whether they should seek guardianship of Mikey, who at 18 would otherwise be regarded as an adult by New Jersey. In an uncomfortably candid conversation, Robbie’s mother sits down to explain to him that he’s autistic, something he doesn’t already know. (“Do you see yourself different from the regular kids in school?” she asks.)While watching “Swim Team,” it’s worth remembering that even the smallest documentary crews aren’t invisible. Kelvin’s mother tells us that he becomes nervous in public places when people stare at him. Sure enough, there are gawkers when they shop at a Goodwill store. In fairness to the onlookers, some may not be staring because of Kelvin’s tics, but because Kelvin is being filmed — hardly an everyday occurrence.But “Swim Team” mostly aims to educate and inspire; on those counts, it succeeds.",N/A,"$4,024",USA,Lara Stolman,"Documentary, Drama, Family",English,72,SWIM TEAM chronicles the overwhelming struggles and extraordinary triumphs of 3 young athletes with autism and shows how a swim team can bring hope to a community.,N/A,Woodland Park Productions,"[{'Value': '8.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",07 Jul 2017,90 min,Swim Team,N/A,2016,8.2,58,"[{'Value': '8.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '100%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '72/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",swim team,,,,,,,,,
269,A.O. SCOTT,1,2017-11-02 04:18:27,A Ghost Story,Review: ‘A Ghost Story’ Has a Sensitive Specter With Time on His Hands,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/movies/review-a-ghost-story.html,2017-07-07,2017-07-05,"Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara play a young couple, one of whom is dead, in David Lowery’s haunting new film.","For perfectly good reasons, the literature of grief dwells on the experiences of the living, the survivors who grapple with the pain of loss and the puzzle of absence. But maybe the dead have feelings, too. That, when you think about it, is the premise of a great many ghost stories, and also of “A Ghost Story,” David Lowery’s ingenious and affecting new film.The specter whose story this is — let’s call him Ghostie, since even when he’s alive we never learn his name — indulges in some of the usual haunting behaviors. He knocks books off shelves, makes light bulbs flicker, opens closet doors in the middle of the night and subjects a terrified family to a full-scale, crockery-smashing supernatural tantrum.The effect of all of this on the viewer is strange and intense but not exactly scary in the expected horror-movie manner. In an age of expanded, digitally enabled ectoplasmic possibility, Mr. Lowery takes a tried-and-true, low-tech, Halloween-costume approach. Ghostie is a bedsheet with eyeholes. Possibly with some digital enhancement, but basically a 6-year-old’s idea of a ghost. And why not? We intuit his moods through the drape and droop of the fabric (the thread count looks pretty decent), and infer a brooding, smoldering temperament behind the cloth. This may be because the person inside — or at least the person Ghostie used to be — is Casey Affleck.Before his transformation into the title character, Mr. Affleck and Rooney Mara — her character is also unnamed — live together in a ranch house in the middle of somewhere. They argue a little about moving, but otherwise they pursue a low-key, harmonious, semi-bohemian existence. He writes songs and experiments with sound. She goes off to work in the morning. They whisper and look gorgeous and occasionally exchange tender, tentative smiles. In some ways these two (and the other human beings who show up from time to time) are the real ghosts in the story — abstract, almost theoretical creatures floating in and out of Ghostie’s troubled consciousness.The couple’s brief time together sets a hushed, poignant tone and establishes the dramatic and emotional limits within which “A Ghost Story” will operate. Not that there aren’t jolts and surprises. Just when you think you’ve cracked the film’s circumscribed logic, it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil. As a metaphysician, Mr. Lowery is not hung up on rules, but as a storyteller and an orchestrator of emotional effects he appreciates the need for coherence.Ghostie is not the only one of his kind in the movie. The dead (at least some of them) can communicate directly with one another and passive aggressively with the living. They can travel in time but not in space, which explains the existence of haunted houses. They witness our suffering and fear but have only the most limited ability to intervene, even though they seem to inhabit, albeit invisibly, the same physical world we do. After a while, Ghostie’s sheet starts looking rumpled and dirty. It’s the only one he has, and he’s been wearing it for a very long time.And time — the ways it can accelerate through years, freeze in moments and defy measurement altogether — is Mr. Lowery’s chief preoccupation here, his major theme and his raw material. At one point, early in her bereavement, Ms. Mara comes home to find a pie left for her by a well-meaning acquaintance. As Ghostie looks on, she takes a few forkfuls and then slumps down against a cabinet and keeps eating, without haste but also without pausing for breath. The camera stays on her for several minutes, which feels like an eternity. Eternity, though, is poor Ghostie’s problem.For him the calendar and the clock have no meaning, and as the film proceeds, growing darker and stranger, we feel his impatience and disorientation. What we don’t feel is the boredom that must surely be part of the story of his long afterlife. “A Ghost Story” is suspenseful, dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional. Daniel Hart’s musical score is full of pathos and longing, compensating — maybe almost overcompensating — for the literal deadpan of the protagonist.The movie may be built around a conceptual gimmick, but it feels less self-conscious than Mr. Lowery’s other recent films, the gloomy Southern crime story “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” (also starring Mr. Affleck and Ms. Mara) and the sweet, borderline-twee remake of the ’70s children’s weepie “Pete’s Dragon.” “A Ghost Story” works so well because it shouldn’t work at all. Starting with a quote from Virginia Woolf, it wears its literary pedigree on its sleeve, yet it manages to feel fresh and inventive rather than stale or studied. It’s like an old tale by Saki or Henry James read for the first time: hair-raising and clever, a tour de force of sensation and a triumph of craft.Movies these days are abuzz with all kinds of paranormal activity, most of it aimed at delivering easy, superficial terror. The scariest scene in “A Ghost Story” may be the most human, when a random guy at a party won’t stop talking about the meaningless of existence in an indifferent universe. Dude, we know! Shut up! Ghostie’s silence at that moment speaks volumes, and his inscrutable presence is a reminder that fright may be an unjust, irrational response to him and his kind. We fear what we don’t understand, and a ghost is only human, after all.","Casey Affleck, Rooney Mara, McColm Cephas Jr., Kenneisha Thompson","$1,594,798",USA,David Lowery,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance",English,84,"In this singular exploration of legacy, love, loss, and the enormity of existence, a recently deceased, white-sheeted ghost returns to his suburban home to try to reconnect with his bereft wife.",R,Ideaman Studios,"[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",27 Jul 2017,92 min,A Ghost Story,David Lowery,2017,6.8,"40,836","[{'Value': '6.8/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '91%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '84/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",a ghost story,A Ghost Story,A24,2595.0,-32.0,21.0,124.0,1544924.0,52.0,17405.0

Comedies don’t come much dumber.Linda Cardellini of “Bloodline” and, a long time ago, “Freaks and Geeks” stars as Leanne, a domineering mother in Austin, Tex., who is trying to fulfill her own failed dreams of vacuous fame through Patty (Ursula Parker), her 11-year-old daughter. Patty, though, can’t seem to conquer the kiddie-pageant circuit that Leanne forces her into, and so, desperate for attention and money, Leanne concocts a scheme to have the girl abducted — just long enough for the family to become media darlings.Skeet Ulrich is the former boyfriend she charms into doing the job, Jon Daly is Leanne’s hapless husband, and Kristen Schaal is a reporter who senses that something is fishy. The cast is surely capable of sharper comedy, but Will Raee, who directed, doesn’t get everyone on the same page. Ms. Cardellini and Ms. Schaal offer cardboard caricatures, while Mr. Ulrich, among others, plays it mostly straight.Craig Robinson, as the reluctant sidekick to Mr. Ulrich’s character, has the film’s only genuine moments as he bonds with his young captive. Once he saw the chemistry between Mr. Robinson and Ms. Parker, Mr. Raee (who also wrote the story, with Brenna Graziano doing the screenplay) should have jettisoned his original idea and let those two take over the tale. Alas, he didn’t.","Linda Cardellini, Skeet Ulrich, Craig Robinson, Kristen Schaal",N/A,USA,Will Raée,"Comedy, Drama",English,46,"A woman who is fed up with her mundane lifestyle hatches a scheme to make her family instant celebrities, but not everything goes as planned as her wild tempered ex-boyfriend starts to lose it.",TV-MA,DIRECTV,"[{'Value': '5.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",07 Jul 2017,104 min,Austin Found,"Brenna Graziano, Will Raée (story)",2017,5.2,444,"[{'Value': '5.2/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '23%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '46/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",austin found,,,,,,,,,
271,MANOHLA DARGIS,0,2017-11-02 04:18:27,Spider-Man: Homecoming,Review: Spider-Man (Again) and All That Sticky Kid Stuff,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/movies/spider-man-homecoming-review.html,2017-07-07,2017-06-29,"This superhero is back in a reboot that features new faces and familiar fights. Tom Holland wears the suit, but Michael Keaton owns the movie.","Sony’s latest Spider-Man movie is kind of like the first and fourth, even if it’s hard to keep track of what happened when in this on-and-off again series. Once more, it spins on Peter Parker (the nice, boyish Tom Holland), a teenager who develops super-skills after he’s bitten by a troublesome spider. The title of the likable, amusing “Spider-Man: Homecoming” indicates that this is a return, though to what exactly? To Queens? To youth? The rest of us can’t go home again, but given that this is the second Spider-Man reboot in 15 years from Sony Pictures it seems Spidey has few other options.“Homecoming” is more or less about how Peter Parker needs to stay forever young, ideally 15 or so years old. What’s always been most appealing about Spider-Man is that he’s a kid, if one who can spin big, sticky webs and swing from rooftop to rooftop, comparatively rinky-dink talents in the flying, magic-hammering superhero world. What makes Spider-Man different and, ideally, work as a character, giving him an off-kilter charm, is he retains the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of adolescence. For all his super-gifts and despite the weird and dangerous company he keeps, he is also a teenage boy — that’s his Kryptonite, what cuts him down to recognizable human size.The team behind “Homecoming” certainly gets that Spider-Man is a kid, even if the movie plays the naïf angle too hard at times, making Peter look not just inexperienced but also silly, a borderline dumb cluck. The movie — credited to six writers and directed by Jon Watts — opens sometime after Peter has been bitten. He’s still trying to get his bearings and struggling to figure out the limits of his powers, which is complicated here by the fact that this is the first Spider-Man movie that Sony has made with Marvel Studios. It’s a liaison that has brought Spider-Man into the Marvel worldwide domination machine, which is why he’s being mentored in the way of the superhero by Marvel’s Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who pops in and out).That machine, known to executives and true believers as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is vast, complicated, lucrative and ever-expanding. It’s also intrinsically uninteresting for viewers (at least one!) who just want a good movie. Marvel has produced a string of movies of wildly divergent quality, but Sony has had a tougher time coming up with regular superhero successes. And so, after stumbling with its first “Spider-Man” resurrection, it cut a deal with Marvel, which is also not inherently interesting. Even so it’s modestly amusing to consider that Sony, much like Peter Parker here, needed help getting off the ground again, and so Marvel stepped in to play its Tony Stark-like guide.For its initial hour, “Homecoming” moves along breezily enough, though sometimes with too much forced airiness. It works best when it sticks close to Peter and is content to be a light, good-natured story of a teenager who’s navigating through, and often badly fumbling, the competing demands of school, home and his emergent Spidey self. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teenager than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing.Mr. Watts’s previous features include “Cop Car,” a slick, small-scaled nail-biter about two boys in peril that showed he knows where to put the camera, is good with actors and has a sadistic streak, which together presumably clinched his big-studio future. “Cop Car” is such an exercise in pressure-cooker cinema that it’s surprising how tamped down the sense of danger is in “Homecoming,” even in some of the earlier sequences in which Peter is still puzzling out how to scuttle and swing as he vanquishes villainy. A brief scene of him sneaking into his bedroom (to avoid Marisa Tomei’s Aunt May) has more tension than any single action set piece.It’s tough to know who the biggest creative force is in a corporate entity like “Homecoming” and how much Mr. Watts contributed to its look, vibe and feel. The movie isn’t visually distinctive over all, and while some of the better action scenes stick low to the ground, as when Spider-Man crashes through suburban backyards and plays bumper cars with trash cans, the airborne special-effects scenes are disappointingly lackluster, particularly in the age of ambitious, eye-stroking diversions like “Doctor Strange.” It’s hard to think of a single image in “Homecoming” that will transcend a first viewing the way that Peter and M. J.’s tender, topsy-turvy kiss did in Sam Raimi’s first “Spider-Man.”And then there’s Michael Keaton, who’s so very good in “Homecoming” that he suggests a future narrative path down which the older, more experienced Spider-Man might eventually go if ever allowed to truly grow up. Mr. Keaton plays the Vulture, the regulation baddie, who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind, with the usual yelling, minions and death. He flies around in a clunky winged apparatus that looks like something from the Wright Brothers’ steampunk phase. This makes for an amusing chunk of heavy-metal décor, but is mostly resonant as a tepid joke about Mr. Keaton’s aerial acrobatics in “Batman” and “Birdman.”The Vulture is a mess of prickly contradictions, only some of which seem intentional. His criminality, rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton, with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes, makes him a memorably angry man, not a caricature. The Vulture becomes a narrative counterweight to Tony Stark’s self-satisfied billionaire. But the Vulture is also the biggest enemy facing Spider-Man, who — as this movie reminds you — is a working-class kid turned superhero. Here, Spidey is eager to do a billionaire’s bidding, partly because he’s being readied to join the Avengers. The question is when Spidey really grows up, who will he fight for and why?","Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., Marisa Tomei","$334,166,825",USA,Jon Watts,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","English, Spanish",73,"Peter Parker balances his life as an ordinary high school student in Queens with his superhero alter-ego Spider-Man, and finds himself on the trail of a new menace prowling the skies of New York City.",PG-13,Sony Pictures,"[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}]",07 Jul 2017,133 min,Spider-Man: Homecoming,"Jonathan Goldstein (screenplay by), John Francis Daley (screenplay by), Jon Watts (screenplay by), Christopher Ford (screenplay by), Chris McKenna (screenplay by), Erik Sommers (screenplay by), Jonathan Goldstein (screen story by), John Francis Daley (screen story by), Stan Lee (based on the Marvel comic book by), Steve Ditko (based on the Marvel comic book by), Joe Simon (Captain America created by), Jack Kirby (Captain America created by)",2017,7.5,"360,460","[{'Value': '7.5/10', 'Source': 'Internet Movie Database'}, {'Value': '92%', 'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes'}, {'Value': '73/100', 'Source': 'Metacritic'}]",spider-man: homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming,Sony Pictures,2986.0,-55.0,37.0,81.0,334198153.0,143.0,17496.0
272,MANOHLA DARGIS,1,2017-11-02 04:18:27,The Big Sick,"Review: In ‘The Big Sick,’ Comedy Is Hard, Love Harder",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/movies/the-big-sick-review-kumail-nanjiani.html,2017-07-14,2017-06-22,"Kumail Nanjiani stars opposite Zoe Kazan in this very funny, moving true story about how he found and almost lost love. Holly Hunter and Ray Romano also star.","Love means having to say you’re sorry — early and often. That’s one of the truisms in “The Big Sick,” a joyous, generous-hearted romantic comedy that, even as it veers into difficult terrain, insists that we just need to keep on laughing. Outwardly, the story seems familiar: A really nice guy falls for a woman he may not be worthy of and nearly blows it. What gives the movie both fizz and sting — and shows that there’s plenty of juice and possibility left in the American romantic comedy — are its particulars, especially the comic Kumail Nanjiani, who plays a fictionalized version of himself, a Pakistani-American struggling to make it in stand-up while fumbling through the rest of his life.Mr. Nanjiani (who shares his name with his character) plays a 30-ish guy navigating these two seemingly irreconcilable worlds and identities. A fledgling Chicago stand-up, Kumail is a regular at a club where, alongside his comrades — played by the real-life funny people Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler — he routinely tries to make a roomful of people laugh. One evening, he teasingly mixes it up with a customer, Emily (a wonderful Zoe Kazan), a jittery charmer with a mile-wide smile whom he soon makes moves on. Flirtation leads to one and then another night together, and before long, they’re frolicking in one of those time-is-passing montages.The real Emily is Emily V. Gordon, who’s married to Mr. Nanjiani. They wrote “The Big Sick” together — it was directed by Michael Showalter — creating comedy and drama from their lives. The story tracks the giddy start of their relationship, with its dazed smiles and intimacy, a romance that seems to collapse when she discovers that he hasn’t told his family about her. Kumail’s parents (Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff, both great), who live within dining distance, are trying to find him a wife and have been parading appealing prospects before him. He wants to please his folks, but he’s falling for Emily. He can’t decide what to do, so she breaks it off, but then falls gravely ill.The movie’s title is a giveaway: Emily’s sickness is big, as well as terrifying and confounding, and it lands her in an intensive care unit, hooked to life support. Before long, she is in an induced coma; Kumail’s doe eyes are watering; and you’re wondering, wait, isn’t this supposed to be a comedy? It is, and through sickness and nearly death, it remains a very funny one, too, producing a wide range of laughs, from staccato titters to abrupt guffaws and huge, body-shaking bursts. The ratio of jokes to screen time is satisfyingly high, and there are few stretches that aren’t enlivened by humor that, joke by joke, with silliness and caustic asides, also deepens the movie.In his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani tells longish, confessional tales about, say, his attempts to be cool in school or watching a pornographic videotape in his parents’ home in Pakistan when the power went out. He can’t get the tape out of the VCR, so he decides he has to “pack my bags and walk the earth, which sucks because I love my parents and I’m 12 years old.” Taken out of context, of course, any given sentence in this kind of circuitous, long-form amble doesn’t sound especially funny. But Mr. Nanjiani builds the bit artfully, aided by a stealthy persona that comes across as perfectly ordinary until he deploys a puckish smile, revs up his adenoidal whine and gets his heavy eyebrows dancing.As he does in his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani, who immigrated to the United States when he was a teenager, mines the comedy of cultural difference in “The Big Sick” with a light, sharp touch. In another, earlier bit, he talks about a roller-coaster ride, which he calls the scariest experience of his life, adding, “and I grew up in Pakistan.” In the movie, he drops a few terrorist-themed jokes so lightly that you’re caught off guard as much by his casual delivery as by the actual gags. You sense that he’s probably heard every ugly joke about Muslims imaginable, and so he’s learned how to get there first, staking a claim on a contested subject, finding humor and strength in other people’s stupidity.In some ways, “The Big Sick” plays like an extended version of one of Mr. Nanjiani’s anecdotal tales, though one streaked in tears and featuring a cast that includes the perfectly paired Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as Emily’s parents. Mr. Showalter, whose movies include “Hello, My Name Is Doris,” isn’t much of a visual stylist — the look of this movie is basically functional plus — but he’s terrific with actors and understands that even minor characters should be people, not background. In “The Big Sick,” you vividly see the person in each role, from nurse (Myra Lucretia Taylor) to would-be bride (Kuhoo Verma), which enriches the emotional texture and underlines that there’s something at stake.Ms. Kazan’s work here is pivotal, especially given that she needs to make a lasting, expressive impact with Emily before the character disappears, and the narrative center of gravity shifts squarely to Kumail. In other words, you need to fall for Emily as much as Kumail does while she pokes and prods him, encouraging him to come out and play. When he’s offstage, Kumail can seem as if he were waiting for something to happen, and when her parents arrive in Chicago, he recedes, turtle-like, creating a recessiveness that makes some of his deadpan discomfort even squirmier. Mostly, Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Kazan look and sound — and, importantly, feel — like people, like people you know and might fall for.I fell hard for both Ms. Kazan and Mr. Nanjiani and “The Big Sick,” which tells a great story with waves of deep feeling and questions of identity and makes the whole thing feel like a breeze. Comedy is said to be hard; mostly, I think, by comics. Romantic comedy is apparently even tougher, at least from recent onscreen evidence. Few filmmakers know how to fit contemporary men and women, straight or gay, into narrative forms that were developed once upon a time. In “The Big Sick,” Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon vault over that hurdle with openness and delight, revitalizing an often moribund subgenre with a true story of love, death and the everyday comedy of being a 21st-century American.","Kumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Holly Hunter, Ray Romano","$42,824,653",USA,Michael Showalter,"Comedy, Drama, Romance","English, Urdu",86,"Pakistan-born comedian Kumail Nanjiani and grad student Emily Gardner fall in love but struggle as their cultures clash.
